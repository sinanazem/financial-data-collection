       "   'content': \"U.S. stocks are mostly higher after returning to action following the long Labor Day holiday weekend in the wake of some disappointing services sector data. While the ISM Services Index unexpectedly accelerated, the final read on August's S&P Global U.S. Services PMI showed growth fell more than expected. The S&P 500 is coming off a three-week losing streak that was capped off by Friday's volatile reaction to a mixed August nonfarm payroll report. The markets continue to grapple with how aggressive the Fed will remain to fight inflation, and commentary from Fed Chairman Powell and the Central Bank's Beige Book report loom on the week's horizon. Treasury yields are moving higher, and the U.S. dollar is resuming a rally back to near multi-decade highs. Crude oil prices are mixed, while gold is lower. In M&A news, CVS Health agreed to acquire Signify Health in a total transaction valued at about $8.0 billion. Asia finished mixed, and Europe is struggling to rebound from yesterday's drop. Inflation and subsequent monetary policy tightening continues to put a strain on the global markets, as Australia hiked rates in line with expectations. International markets also grappled with the festering energy crisis in Europe and the announcement of a new prime minister in the U.K. At 10:58 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3%, the S&P 500 Index is rising 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite is mostly unchanged. WTI crude oil is rising $0.16 to $87.03 per barrel, while Brent crude oil is dropping $2.98 at $92.76 per barrel. The gold spot price is trading $6.70 lower to $1,715.80 per ounce, and the Dollar Index is advancing 0.7% to 110.21. Natural Gas prices have traded in a range of $8.31-9.126 and were last seen trading lower by $0.391 (or -4.45%) to $8.395/MMBtu. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research Today’s Bullish Activity Leading the point gainers list this morning is Illumina Inc. (ILMN + $12.52 to $208.59) following news that European Union (EU) antitrust regulators have blocked the company’s acquisition of biotech company Grail, saying that the deal would have stifled competition and significantly limited choices in blood-based early cancer detection tests. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said that she would issue a separate decision ordering the re-establishment of Grail as an independent entity. Illumina said that they plan on challenging the EU’s veto of the ~$7.1B deal which was announced in August of 2021. Calls are outnumbering puts ~3:1 with the October 21st 210.00 call being the highest volume contract (volume is 481). Also trading to the upside is IVERIC Bio Inc. (ISEE + $3.56 to $13.00) after the biopharmaceutical company announced that its experimental Geographic Atrophy (GA) treatment (zimura) met the main goal in a late-stage study. The company said that zimura was statistically significant in reducing the rate of progression of GA at the 12-month mark versus the placebo. Based on the results, IVERIC said that it intends to submit a marketing application to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in the first quarter of next year. Calls are outnumbering puts ~3:2 with the October 21st 15.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 25,216). New 52-week highs (16 new highs today): Cogent Biosciences Inc. (COGT + $1.00 to $17.31), International Seaways Inc. (INSW + $1.36 to $32.00), Prometheus Biosciences Inc. (RXDX + $0.89 to $57.89) Notable Call Activity Shares of ADT Inc. (ADT + $1.09 to $8.30) are gapping up above the 200-day Simple Moving Average this morning following news that the home-security firm has secured a $1.5B investment from State Farm (along with an additional $150M investment from Google for product development) and option traders are taking note. Calls are outpacing puts ~7:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 16th 9.00 call. Volume on this contract is 2,092 versus open interest of 347, which suggests that the volume primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the transactions on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times for between $0.08-0.10 each, which suggests bullish intent. Today’s ~15% jump puts ADT above the 200-day Simple Moving Average of $7.47. Today’s Bearish Activity Moving lower this morning is ShockWave Medical Inc. (SWAV - $19.79 to $272.39) after Oppenheimer downgraded the medical device maker to “Underperform” from “Market Perform” and put a $165.00 price target on the stock. Oppenheimer analyst Suraj Kalia stated, “Our rating change reflects our fundamental belief: 1) clinical evidence on SWAV IVL mixed, at best. Possibility of class effect quite real; 2) Total Addressable Market (TAM) nowhere close to implied Street outlook; 3) high ASP unsustainable; 4) lack of IP protection = low barriers to entry; 5) stock currently trades at ~17x our FY23E P/S (~3.5x std. dev. above medtech mean). Quarterly outperformance cannot keep up with expectations, in our view, therefore limiting material stock upside.” Option volume is relatively light with the September 16th 310.00 call being the highest volume contract (volume is 49). Also trading to the downside is Ciena Corp. (CIEN - $1.43 to $42.79) after J.P. Morgan downgraded the telecom equipment maker to “Neutral” from “Overweight” and cut their price target on the stock to $45.00 from $62.00, citing “limited upside”. J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee stated, “Ciena continues to expect revenues for fiscal 2023 to track at or around $4.2B (in line with consensus expectations heading into the print), which in our view is a stretch target and requires either limited disruptions in the supply chain on a go-forward basis or demand moderation for the industry easing up supply.” Option volume is relatively light with the September 16th 45.00 put being the highest volume contract (volume is 55). New 52-week lows (200 new lows today): Baxter International Inc. (BAX - $1.02 to $55.19), Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR - $6.10 to $401.04), DocuSign Inc. (DOCU - $0.77 to $53.68) Notable Put Activity Some unusual put activity (~20:1 over calls) is being seen in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VOO + $0.55 to $361.00) which is primarily being driven by activity on the December 16th 295.00 put. Volume on this contract is 10,111 versus open interest of 2,427, so we know that the activity primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the transactions on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times at the ask price of $3.60, which suggests bearish intent. Volume Signals iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD - $0.08 to $149.00): Option volume is running at over 45x the daily average on this ETF as option traders primarily target the January 2023 123.00 put. Volume on this contract is 11,279 versus open interest of 0, so we know that all of the volume represents fresh positioning (assuming no day trades). The bulk of the transactions on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times at the ask price of $1.70 each, which suggests bearish intent. SPDR Real Estate Select Sector ETF (XLRE + $0.37 to $41.65): Option volume is running at over 3x the daily average on this ETF which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 18th 35.00 put. Volume on this contract is 2,982 versus open interest of 265, so we know that the volume primarily represents new positioning. The majority of the transactions on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times at the ask price of $0.35 each, which suggests bearish intent. ChargePoint Holdings Inc. (CHPT + $0.40 to $14.90): A couple of large blocks were seen simultaneously trading on the September 16th expiration earlier this morning: 16.00 call (open interest is 3,678): A 30,000 contract block was bought for $0.32 when the bid/ask spread was $0.25 x $0.34. 18.00 call (open interest is 3,456): A 30,000 contract block was sold at the bid price of $0.08. We know that both of these blocks are new positions based on the respective open interest figures and it appears that a $2.00-wide bull call spread was established for a net debit of $0.24 (x 30K contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions). The positioning suggests that the block trader believes that CHPT will close above the break-even price of $16.24 at expiration. Gauging Volatility The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX + 0.78 to 26.25) has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (the intraday range is 25.33-27.80) as equity markets are mixed around the mid-day mark (DJI + 30, SPX + 10, COMPX - 11). VIX option volume has been tepid today as the index is currently missing from the “Top Volume by Underlying” list. Today’s options activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.48), but the highest volume contract is the December 22nd 22.00 put (volume is 7,000 versus open interest of 8,210).

       "   'content': 'U.S. job data was released last Friday, before the long holiday weekend, that stirred debate over the Fed’s future steps to combat inflation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 315,000 jobs were added in August, higher than the forecasted 295,000 jobs. This was lower than July’s revised figure of 526,000 Non-Farm Payrolls added. Jobs were mainly added in the professional and business services sector, at 68,000. Next in line, the health care sector and retail trade sector added 48,200 jobs and 44,000 jobs, respectively. Leisure and hospitality also added 31,000 payrolls while the manufacturing sector added 22,000. All other sectors that added jobs were 17,000 payrolls or less for the month of August. Fed Chairmen Jerome Powell had previously nixed the idea the Federal Reserve would consider a rate cut in 2023 with the expectation that inflation will not have cooled, and continue hawkish rate increases until significant progress is made. This positive job data could allow the Fed to be less aggressive with their current strategy, which could give relief to battled equity index prices. The European Central Bank may also be following suit with the FOMC with a 75-basis point rate hike, while Eurozone headline inflation has crossed 9%. Outside of the payroll numbers, the unemployment rate was worse than expected at 3.7%, hotter than the forecasted 3.5%. Average hourly earnings were also less favorable than expected with an increase of 0.3% in August, lower than the expected 0.4%. Investors will be awaiting Fed Chair Powell speech this Thursday as outline over monetary policy has shifted. Technicals Coming off of a shortened holiday session, the E-mini Dow futures contract for September expiration, YMU22, is trading higher. After Friday’s release of U.S. job data, the futures climbed early in the session only to fizzle out and finish negative at session lows. YMU22 is currently trading below all 20 to 200-day SMA figures, with the recent equity sellout pulling the contract almost 8% lower than the recent high on August 18th. The selling trend has pushed the 14-day Relative Strength Index to 36%, while nearing a potential mid-term supports near 31,000 to 30,000 touched in late June to early July.

       "   'content': 'Weekly market review U.S. equities are trading higher around mid-morning as investors digest the employment data that came out before the bell and how it might factor into the Federal\\'s Reserve approach towards its monetary policy. August\\'s Nonfarm Payrolls report provided some signs of softening in the labor market—the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% (above the 3.5% estimate), there was a two-month downward revision to June/July\\'s data, the Labor Force Participation Rate rose to 62.4% from 62.1% in the prior month, and Average Hourly Earnings came in at 0.3% (below the 0.4% expected). Following the report, the Bloomberg probability of a 75-basis-point hike at this month\\'s FOMC meeting dropped from ~70% to ~54%. Today\\'s up market is a welcome move for the bulls, but the S&P 500 is still down ~1% on the week. If you read last week\\'s blog, you know that I had a \"slightly bearish\" outlook for this week, and it appears (at least at the time of this writing) that my outlook was on point. The week\\'s notable 52-week highs Altimmune Inc. (ALT + $0.81 to $22.64) Cardinal Health Inc. (CAH - $0.21 to $71.11) Chemocentryx Inc. (CCXI - $0.03 to $51.60) Cogent Biosciences Inc. (COGT + $0.11 to $17.10) Essa Bancorp Inc. (ESSA + $0.00 to $20.15) Faze Holdings Inc. (FAZE - $0.91 to $17.58) Napco Security Technologies Inc. (NSSC - $0.33 to $28.53) New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU - $0.96 to $26.86) Prometheus Biosciences Inc. (RXDX - $0.30 to $56.04) Turquoiose Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ - $0.21 to $31.09) This week\\'s notable 52-week lows Abercrombie & Fitch Company (ANF - $0.20 to $15.24) Ambarella Inc. (AMBA + $0.27 to $64.43) AMC Entertainment Inc. (AMC - $0.73 to $8.39) Concentrix Corp. (CNXC + $0.23 to $124.02) Intel Corp. (INTC + 0.24 to $32.00) Medtronic Inc. (MDT + $0.02 to $88.55) Nvidia Corp. (NVDA - $1.24 to $138.13) Salesforce Inc. (CRM + $1.64 to $155.17) SAP AG (SAP + $0.96 to $84.94) Stanley Black & Decker Inc. (SWK - $0.56 to $86.32) Twilio Inc. (TWLO - $0.30 to $67.35) Q2 Corporate earnings Nearly all (494/500) of the S&P 500 companies have reported Q2 earnings, and the \"beat rates\" thus far are 62% on the top line and 75% on the bottom line. This compares to the respective 63% and 76% beat rates from the first quarter. Next week\\'s earnings calendar is relatively light as you might expect, but there are still several higher-profile names in the lineup (bolded below): Monday (6th): Tuesday (7th): KC, PATH, GWRE, COUP Wednesday (8th): NIO, GIII, CPRT, GME Thursday (9th): BILI, ZS, DOCU Friday (10th): KR, ABM Volatility The Cboe volatility index (VIX) is off the mid-August lows, but also off last week\\'s highs when it ran up toward the 28 level. For reference, a VIX around 24 suggests a ~1.50% daily move (either higher or lower) in the SPX, which translates to ~61 points. Source: Schwab StreetSmart Edge® Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Unusual options activity Unusual call activity Chico\\'s FAS Inc. (CHS + $0.17 to $5.65): Calls are outpacing puts ~50:1 which is primarily being driven by a 2,000 contract block that was bought on the November 18th 7.00 call at the ask price of $0.20 (open interest is 1,050). We know that this block is a new position, and we can assume that the block trader believes that CHS will close above the break-even price of $7.20 at expiration. Unusual put activity Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ - $0.06 to $44.90): Puts are outpacing calls ~16:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the January 2023 25.00 put. Volume on this contract is 10,260 (vs. open interest of 15,419), which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times for between $0.68-0.75 each. It\\'s likely that these put purchases are new (bearish) positions given the expiration date, but we can\\'t be sure given the open interest figure. Heavy option volume Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund (VWO + $0.08 to $41.02): Option volume is running at over 3x the daily average on this fund as option traders primarily target the January 2023 41.00 call. Volume on this contract is 4,800 versus open interest of 1,429, so we know that the volume primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the transactions on this contract consisted of various mid-sized blocks (858, 857, 583, etc.) that were being bought at various times at the ask price of $1.85 each, which suggests bullish intent. Universal Display Corp. (OLED + $0.45 to $109.36): Option volume is running at ~2x the daily average on this digital display technology company which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 23rd 105.00 put. Volume on this contract is 2,713 versus open interest of 29, so it\\'s likely that nearly all of the volume represents fresh positioning. The bulk of the transactions on this contract consisted of various mid-sized blocks that were being sold at various times for between $3.30-$3.55 each. The positioning suggests that the put sellers believe that OLED will close above the $105.00 price level and/or are comfortable taking a long position in the stock in the event that it closes below $105.00 at expiration. Cameco Corp. (CCJ + $0.82 to $29.37): Several large blocks were seen trading on the December 16th expiration earlier this morning: 31.00 call (open interest is 367): A 15,000 contract block was bought for $2.89 when the bid/ask spread was $2.65 x $3.10 and (at a different time) a 7,500 contract block traded for $2.96, directly in the middle of the $2.82 x $3.10 bid/ask spread. 37.00 call (open interest is 101): A 15,000 contract block was sold (simultaneously with the 15K block above) for $1.20 when the bid/ask spread was $1.08 x $1.51 and (at a different time) a 7,500 contract block was sold (simultaneously with the 7,500 contract block above) for $1.27 when the bid/ask spread was $1.21 x $1.50. We know that all of these blocks are new positions based on the respective open interest figures and it appears that two $6.00-wide bull call spreads were established here. Technical outlook S&P 500 Index ($SPX + 43 to 4,010): From a near-term technical perspective, it\\'s encouraging for the bulls that the 3,900 support level (blue line) held up yesterday. However, it\\'s possible that the SPX might be establishing a classic bearish \"pull back\" to the 50-day SMA from below, so the bulls would like to see the index get back above this moving average to dispel that. From an intermediate-term perspective, there is still a bearish tilt as the index ran into resistance at the 200-day SMA back in mid-August: Source: Schwab StreetSmart Edge® Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Russell 2000 ($RUT + 9 to 1,832): Similar to the SPX, the Russell 2000 also appears to be going through a bearish \"pull back\" set-up, but it\\'s too early to really say. The technical picture should be clearer next week. If the RUT can get back above the 50-day SMA (currently 1,849), this would be a near-term bullish victory. Source: Schwab StreetSmart Edge® Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Nasdaq-100 ($NDX + 26 to 12,301): If you look at a longer-term chart of the NDX, you can see that the 150-week Simple Moving Average has been a fairly significant support level for his index. It bounced off this moving average back in December of 2018 (taper tantrum/Fed pivot), the pandemic low in March of 2020, and earlier this year. Currently the NDX is about 30 points below the 150-week SMA (12,333 at the time of this writing), so this might be an important indicator to monitor in the coming weeks. The NDX vacillated just below this indicator back in the May-June timeframe (hence the \"battleground\" analogy), but it would be an encouraging sign for the bulls if the index could push back above it. Source: Schwab StreetSmart Edge® Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Two-Year Yields (USGG2YR - 0.0915 to 3.4079): Part of the reason for the recent downturn in equities has to do with the fact that yields on the two-year Treasury have eclipsed the June highs and hit 15-year highs this week. The rise in two-year yields speaks to the rising assessment of Fed hawkishness, which has recently rattled stocks. Additionally, with U.S. 10-year Treasury yields at 3.21%, there is still a 20-basis-point differential, meaning the 2/10 yield curve is still inverted. Source: Bloomberg L.P. Cryptocurrencies A long-awaited software upgrade to the cryptocurrency platform Ethereum called \"The Merge\" is expected to take place on September 15th, 2022. The upgrade is meant to bring together the currently used Ethereum Mainnet with its new proof-of-stake consensus layer, the Beacon Chain. The shift is meant to move Ethereum from an energy intensive state (proof of work), to a more energy efficient model (proof of stake). The transition is expected to lay the groundwork for more upgrades in the future (which should help lower fees) and includes sharding (which is the splitting and distributing of one logical data set across multiple databases that share nothing and can be deployed across multiple servers). According to Ethereum.org, The Merge will reduce Ethereum\\'s energy consumption by ~99.95%. Ethereum\\'s price has dropped roughly 20% over the past two weeks and was last seen trading up 2.27% to $1.593.38. Economic recap We received a mixed bag of economic data this week, which was highlighted by some welcome loosening (albeit modest) in the labor market conditions. Here\\'s a recap of the individual reports that came out this week: Better Than Estimates: Consumer Confidence: 103.2 vs. 98.0 est JOLTS: 11.239M vs. 10.8M est Initial Jobless Claims: 232K vs. 255K est ISM Manufacturing Index: 52.8% vs. 51.8% est Productivity-Revised: -4.1% vs. -4.5% est Unit Labor Costs – Revised: 10.2% vs. 10.9% est Average Hourly Earnings: +0.3% vs. +0.4% est Nonfarm Payrolls: 315K vs. 310K Nonfarm Private Payrolls: 308K vs. 300K est Worse Than Estimates: S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index: 18.6% vs. 18.7% est ADP Employment Change: 132K vs. 300K est (report showed 7.6% rise in wages) Chicago PMI: 52.2 vs. 52.5 Construction Spending: -0.4% vs. 0.0% est Factory Orders: -1.0% vs. 0.2% est Average Workweek: 34.5 vs. 34.6 est Unemployment Rate: 3.7% vs. 3.5% est Key take-aways from this week\\'s data: This week\\'s Initial Jobless Claims number was the lowest reported since the week ending June 25th. Here\\'s a look at next week\\'s lineup: Monday (5th): Tuesday (6th): ISM Non-Manufacturing Index Wednesday (7th): Trade Balance, MBA Mortgage Applications Index Thursday (8th): Consumer Credit, Continuing Claims, EIA Crude Oil Inventories, EIA Natural Gas Inventories, Initial Jobless Claims Friday (9th): Wholesale Inventories We\\'ve got a fairly light schedule on the economic front next week, but I\\'d keep an eye on next Thursday\\'s Initial Jobless Claims report. This week the Initial Claims came in at 232K, which was well below the 250K estimate, and stocks didn\\'t react positively. Since the weekly Initial Claims report is more of a leading indicator than the monthly Non-Farm Payrolls report, the bulls would probably like to see some confirming softening in these weekly numbers as well. Summary Today\\'s price action in stocks suggests that higher rate concerns still persist, despite today\\'s softer employment data. Stocks are reversed course and are essentially trading at the lows of the day at the time of this writing (DJI - 83; SPX -13; COMPX -72). This really isn\\'t encouraging price action for the bulls given that the SPX is near-term oversold, having dropped nearly 6% over the past six trading days. In addition, it\\'s also not encouraging to see the SPX and RUT pull back from their respective 50-day SMAs today. There\\'s still a couple of hours to go in today\\'s session, so anything can happen, but it appears that the SPX could be setting up for another test of the 3,900 support level. If we get there, and that level doesn\\'t hold up, then look for support around the 3,775-3,800 area. It\\'s difficult to assess which way stocks will trend next week, given that the technicals remain bearish, but on a nearer-term basis they are oversold. I\\'d monitor two-year yields for potential direction (higher = bearish, lower = bullish). Therefore, the most logical outlook I can provide for next week is \"Volatile.\"'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Stocks dropped after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell vowed to bring inflation down despite potential \"pain\" to households and businesses.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Stocks dropped Friday after a relatively \"hawkish\" speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell fueled fears that the Fed\\'s policies would lead to weaker economic growth, rising unemployment, and lower corporate profits. The S&P 500 closed down 3.4%, while the Treasury yield curve became even more inverted. Powell\\'s speech at the annual Kansas City Federal Reserve symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., strongly indicated that the central bank was focused squarely on bringing inflation down, even at a cost to economic growth and employment. He even mentioned that there may be \"some pain\" to households and businesses and a weaker job market. Although Powell\\'s message does not represent a change in the Fed\\'s policy stance, it was the clearest expression of the Fed\\'s intentions from the chairman on the need to keep tightening monetary policy \"until the job is done.\" Moreover, it comes at a time when there are signs that inflation is cooling off. Recent inflation readings for the Consumer Price Index and the Personal Consumption Expenditures index have eased, import prices are falling, and inflation expectations are moderating. In the bond market, expectations for the pace of rate hikes didn\\'t change much. Short-term yields had already built in the likelihood of a rise in the federal funds rate to 3.75% over the next six months. Thirty-year Treasury bond yields declined, because tighter Fed policy for longer sends a signal of slower growth and lower inflation down the road. Consequently, the Treasury yield curve (the difference between short and long-term rates) became more inverted. Our firmest conviction is that the more forcefully the Fed tightens policy, the more the yield curve will become inverted. An inverted yield curve has historically been associated with recessions. What should long-term investors do now? Market volatility is unsettling, but historically not unusual. If you\\'ve built an appropriately diversified portfolio that matches your time horizon and risk tolerance, it\\'s likely the recent market drop will be a mere blip in your long-term investing plan. However, it can be hard to do nothing when markets are rough. Given what has been happening recently, consider a few of our investing principles: Establish a financial plan. It\\'s easier to ride out volatility if you have a financial plan based on your goals and investing time horizon. By keeping your eye on the finish line, you\\'ll be less likely to panic and sell when prices are down. Don\\'t try to time the markets. It\\'s nearly impossible. Time in the market is what matters. While staying the course and continuing to invest even when markets dip may be hard on your nerves, it can be healthier for your portfolio and result in greater accumulated wealth over time. Build a diversified portfolio based on your tolerance for risk. It\\'s important to know your comfort level with temporary losses. Sometimes a market drop serves as a wake-up call that you\\'re not as comfortable with losses as you thought you were, or that a portfolio you assumed was appropriately diversified in fact isn\\'t. Schwab clients can log in and use the Schwab Portfolio Checkup tool to quickly assess whether their portfolio is still in balance with their target asset allocation. Rebalance your portfolio regularly. Market changes can skew your allocation from its original target. Over time, assets that have gained in value will account for more of your portfolio, while those that have declined will account for less. Rebalancing means selling positions that have become overweight in relation to the rest of your portfolio, and moving the proceeds to positions that have become underweight. It\\'s a good idea to do this at regular intervals. Ignore the noise. It\\'s hard to shift your attention when headlines and TV news are focused on the market drop. However, markets historically have fluctuated and recovered. It\\'s important to stay focused on your plan and track progress toward your goal, not short-term performance.'},\n",

Breadth thrust … with a but At the recent high, about 93% of stocks within the S&P 500 were trading above their 50-day moving averages—fitting the definition of a \"breadth thrust.\" What makes it unique relative to others in history, however, is that the Federal Reserve is in an aggressive interest rate hiking campaign. Other than in February 2019 when the Fed was on hold, the nine other breadth surges off lows since 1975 all occurred during Fed easing campaigns (hat tip to our friends at Strategas for that stat). In addition, all 10 prior breadth surges (including 2019\\'s) were accompanied by a positive 2y/10y yield spread. As most readers know, that yield spread is decidedly negative (inverted) today. The rally that began in mid-June was directly related to the nearly 3.5% peak in the 10-year Treasury yield; with only two days separating that peak on June 14 with the S&P 500\\'s low on June 16, shown below. Perhaps contributing to last week\\'s weakness in stocks was the renewed upward move in bond yields—from a low that nearly reached 2.5% as August began, to about 3% today. Bond yields driving stocks?

At the sector level, leadership during the two months between the June 16 low and the recent high on August 16 was concentrated among the growthier Consumer Discretionary (+29%) and Technology (+23%) sectors, with the Energy sector the only one in the red (-1%) for that period. However, Utilities have been the best performer month-to-date (MTD), which suggests some underlying defensiveness has crept back into leadership characteristics.

Sector quilt highlights volatility Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg. As of 8/19/2022. Sector performance is represented by price returns of the following 11 GICS sector indices: Consumer Discretionary Sector, Consumer Staples Sector, Energy Sector, Financials Sector, Health Care Sector, Industrials Sector, Information Technology Sector, Materials Sector, Real Estate Sector, Communication Services Sector, and Utilities Sector.

We are doing a lot more work on factors—which are \"characteristics,\" in lay terms—along with our colleagues within the Schwab Equity Ratings (SER) team, and we are looking forward to rolling out more of that research in the near future. In the meantime, we put together a monthly factor quilt, shown below, using Bloomberg\\'s factors. Heading into June this year, five of the prior six months were led by value stocks; while even June had a more defensive bent with dividends on top. As the rally picked up steam however, higher volatility and trade activity bested the more fundamentally-driven factors of dividends and profitability in July and August-to-date. Factor quilt highlights recent shifts Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg. As of 8/19/2022. The Dividends portfolio measures the most recently announced net dividend (annualized) divided by the current market price. The Growth portfolio captures the difference between high and low growers by using historical fundamental and forward-looking analyst data. The Leverage portfolio looks at firms\\' level of leverage using book and market leverage, along with debt to total assets. The Momentum portfolio separates stocks that have outperformed over the past year vs. those that have underperformed. The Profitability portfolio studies firms\\' profit margins using return on equity, return on assets, return on capital employed, and EBITDA margin. The Size portfolio distinguishes between small and large stocks using market capitalization, sales, and total assets. The Trade Activity portfolio is a turnover-based measure that looks at trading volume normalized by shares outstanding. The Value portfolio differentiates between \"cheap\" and \"rich\" stocks using valuation metrics such as earnings/price and book/price. The Variability portfolio gauges how consistent earnings, cash flows, and sales have been in recent years. The Volatility portfolio differentiates between more and less volatile stocks by looking at various aspects such as return volatility over the latest 252 trading days. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Returns assume reinvestment of dividends, interest, and capital gains. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Given ongoing weakness in the economy and the more recent rolling over of forward earnings estimates, we continue to recommend that stock-picking oriented investors focus on quality-based factors, like higher profitability, dividends, lower volatility, healthy balance sheets and strong free cash flow. Reversion to the meme The aforementioned stronger breadth aside, a burgeoning characteristic of the rally was heightened speculative froth. Some of the largest gains during the rally were concentrated down the quality spectrum—namely among some of the meme stocks. Mimicking some moves seen in the latter part of 2020 and early months of 2021, speculative segments of the market went parabolic again recently. While it was GameStop that initially stole the headlines in early 2021, this time, Bed Bath & Beyond captured the zeitgeist. Shown below, the \"original\" memes such as GameStop and AMC had double- and triple-digit percentage gains over the past month (the metric shown is each stock\\'s performance from its rolling 40-day low). However, Bed Bath & Beyond broke through the ceiling in recent weeks, surging by more than 400% at one point. The meme extreme Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 8/19/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Individual stocks shown for illustration purposes only. We don\\'t generally try to dissect the reasoning behind memes\\' explosive rallies; mostly because there typically isn\\'t much (if any) fundamental analysis involved … generally, it\\'s pure speculation. Such was the case with Bed Bath & Beyond (rated either D or F by SER throughout 2022 so far). Other than increased chatter about the stock within various chatrooms and social media sites, there was no concrete basis for it meteoric surge. That differs a bit from the original meme craze, which began as a rebellion against hedge funds that had aggressively bet against companies with weak (or no) fundamentals. Tragically, for many retail traders—especially those who \"got in\" on the recent rally near the peak—prices have collapsed over the past few trading days for stocks like Bed Bath & Beyond. In fact, Friday\\'s swoon was the stock\\'s worst day in history, falling a whopping 41%. Compared to the early-2021 frenzy, the irony associated with the stock\\'s decline this time is that it was a billionaire investor\\'s fund that came out on top—pocketing a hefty gain from a sale near the peak, which triggered the rout in the stock. On top of that, capping off the trading week was an announcement that the company\\'s suppliers are restricting or halting shipments as the retailer has fallen behind on payments. As is always the case, we never point out individual stocks for recommendation (either buy or sell) purposes. The flash rally and crash of stocks like many of the memes should serve as an important reminder for investors: Neither \"get in\" nor \"get out\"—and/or \"get rich quick\" schemes—are investing strategies. They simply represent gambling on moments in time—the antithesis of investing, which should be a disciplined process over time. That\\'s a good place to end.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'There is always a lot of controversy around the implications of high government debt. Over the past 70 years, high (and rising) government debt has generally been accompanied by weaker economic activity. The cause and effect can be debated, and there is also a bit of a chicken-and-egg, or \"circular\" argument: High and rising debt is a burden on growth, but low levels of growth also trigger an increase in government spending, higher budget deficits and higher debt. In other words, one argument holds that a high and rising burden of debt crimps economic growth due to the \"crowding-out\" effect (that is, servicing the debt crowds out more productive spending and/or investments). A competing argument is that economic growth generally has been slowing over the past several decades—driven by demographics, globalization/competition, technology/innovation, and low inflation—which has led to increased government spending to try to boost growth, thereby increasing the deficit and, in turn, debt levels. The chart below represents the broadest measure of government debt, including federal government debt, state and local debt, and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt (e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). Courtesy of the strength of the economic rebound coming out of the lockdown phase of the pandemic—at the federal, state and local levels—government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has moved lower, which is good news (at least in relative terms).

Although it\\'s not supported by any historical data, there is an elevated concern expressed about high debt and whether it, in and of itself, leads to serious and persistent inflation. The visual below looks at every decade since the 1970s—each color-coded. It shows the relationship between debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) and the inflation rate, as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure (which is the Federal Reserve\\'s preferred metric). As shown, as debt growth expanded as a share of GDP, inflation moved lower, not higher. There is a more recent debate about how much of the past year\\'s inflation surge is due largely to COVID-19-specific supply/demand dislocations vs. the blow-out of the budget deficit as fiscal stimulus ramped up to ease the strains of the COVID recession. The answer is probably both. Debt vs. inflation Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 3/31/2022. Looking back, the United States\\' \"net national savings\" rate was relatively high coming out of World War II, but the United States had to finance itself internally after the war, given that Europe and Japan were all in dire financial straits. The difference today is that those and other countries have been more than willing to buy U.S. debt. In addition, the cost of servicing debt is currently historically low, so the Federal Reserve\\'s role in \"financing U.S. debt\" is occurring at a very low cost (even if there are unintended negative consequences). In fact, as shown below, net interest payments are expected to remain low, before accelerating again. Interest payments low for now Source: Charles Schwab, CBO (Congressional Budget Office): The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2022 to 2032 (5/25/2022). Longer term, the burden of interest payments is expected to accelerate, as shown above. Based on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the projected growth rate in government spending on interest payments over the next decade will swamp the growth rate of other spending categories. Interest payments\\' high growth Source: Charles Schwab, CBO (Congressional Budget Office): The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2022 to 2032 (5/25/2022). More debt is unlikely to generate greater economic growth Even under any future dire assumptions of the growth rate of net interest payments, we believe there is little risk of a U.S. debt default. In the meantime, there is generally an agreed-upon set of ways government can reduce its debt burden. One way, which the United States has been employing since the pandemic erupted is typically referred to as \"financial repression\"—involving keeping interest rates extremely low, which keeps real yields in negative territory. This force is not yet in the rear-view mirror, but the Federal Reserve has, of course, aggressively raised interest rates this year. Another way is for the government to reduce spending and/or increase taxes. Thanks to the removal of much of the pandemic-related direct fiscal stimulus, and the beneficial impact on tax receipts courtesy of the strong economic recovery coming out of the lockdowns, both are working in favor of bringing down the rate of debt growth. Finally, the government can also try to boost growth and inflation, such that the denominator (GDP) is growing faster than the numerator (debt). That was exactly what happened in the late 1940s, just after WWII. Today, however, inflation is growing much faster than the economy, as well as faster than wage and income growth. What we do know now is that as the debt ratio was soaring, each additional dollar of debt lead to significantly less than a dollar\\'s worth of economic growth. This is referred to as the \"credit multiplier\" or \"money multiplier.\" More debt is unlikely to generate greater economic growth, other than perhaps for a short span of time. As noted earlier, the weight of debt also represents a weight on economic growth. For all the cheering of the June 2009 to February 2020 expansion being the longest on record, it was also the weakest on record, as shown below. Prior post-WWII economic expansion long, but weak Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Economic Analysis, as of 6/30/2022. A key to durable economic growth likely will require a continued move down in government debt ratios, which could trigger an expansion in the aforementioned credit multiplier.'},\n",

In early 2022, stocks around the world began to slide into a bear market as the net number of central banks hiking rates turned positive. The number of central banks hiking rates is now higher than the number that were hiking in 2008, when central banks attempted to rein in the massive liquidity fueling the global housing bubble. But now, signs are beginning to emerge that the trend in rate hikes may be nearing a peak which may be welcome news for investors. Near a peak in rate hikes? Source: Charles Schwab, Macrobond data as of 8/10/2022. Beginning of the end? The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) and the Czech National Bank (CNB) were the first major emerging market central banks to start tightening policy last year and lead the rush of other emerging market and developed market central banks to raise rates. They both now appear to be signaling that their respective rates have peaked. In Brazil, the August 3 statement from the central bank stated that it will evaluate the need for a \"residual hike of a smaller magnitude\" after its 50-basis-point (bp) hike announced that day. The BNB is effectively signaling that hikes were likely over but that they were open to evaluating the need for one additional, smaller, and likely final, 25 bp hike at the September meeting. In the Czech Republic, the central bank held rates steady on August 3 after a series of hikes totaling 675 bps and stated that \"rates are at a level that is dampening domestic demand pressures.\" This suggests a view that any further rate hikes are unlikely to be effective in reining in inflation in the near term as growth is expected to weaken in the Czech Republic and around the world. Market sees a peak in early 2023 Following the signs of an end to rate hikes among those central banks that led the rate hikes, the market now expects the major central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), European Central Bank (ECB), and Bank of England (BoE), may end their rate hikes in the first half of next year.

Forecasts contained herein are for illustrative purposes only, may be based upon proprietary research and are developed through analysis of historical public data. The market expects the peak in rates to be followed by a gradual decline in policy rates beginning in the first half of 2023. But looking back, historically declines in policy rates haven\\'t been gradual. In fact, over the past 20 years, the turn from hikes to cuts has tended to be abrupt, often in response to economic recessions. Rapid moves from hikes to cuts and back again was also the case during the inflationary-stubborn 1970s, for central banks when monetary policy was much different than today. Monetary policy tended to transition quickly from hikes to cuts over the past 50 years Source: Charles Schwab, Macrobond, CME Group, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank as of 8/10/2022.

Forecasts contained herein are for illustrative purposes only, may be based upon proprietary research and are developed through analysis of historical public data. Stocks and the end of rate hikes An end to central bank rate hikes may help to turn around the losses seen this year in stock markets in major countries around the world. In the U.S., history shows that after each of the last rate hikes by the Fed, the S&P 500 Index posted, on average, a gain of almost 15% over the next 12 months since 1970, with gains in eight of the 11 one-year periods following each peak in the federal funds rate. In the United Kingdom, after each of the last BoE rate hikes, the MSCI United Kingdom Index rose on average 9.4% over the next 12 months, posting gains in seven of the 11 one-year periods following each peak in the bank rate. In Europe, the ECB and its predecessor the German Bundesbank moved the policy rate relatively less often and less dramatically over the past 50 years. After each of the last rate hikes, the Europe STOXX 600 Index was flat (+0.1%) on average over the following 12 months, posting gains in only three of the seven periods. Historically, the central banks of Europe tended to take more gradual and longer paths for their rate hikes, with cycles often ending by an unrelated development such as the European Debt Crisis in 2011 or the U.S.-led Great Financial Crisis in 2008 and Dot-Com bubble bursting in 2000. This contributed to the weaker post-rate-hike performance. With the ECB adopting an approach to monetary policy similar to the U.S. and U.K. in recent years, the stock market outcome may become more favorable. Stocks on average have posted gains after the last rate hike Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 8/11/2022. Performance measured from day of last rate hike by the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, or ECB/Bundesbank, respectively. Indexes used: U.S. = S&P 500 Index, United Kingdom = MSCI United Kingdom Index, Europe = Europe STOXX 600 Index and the F.A.Z. Index of top German companies prior to the 12/31/1986 inception of the STOXX index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Hindsight vs real time Of course, it is easy to mark the timing of the last rate hike in hindsight. But that is much harder in real time. There is no guarantee that the market or central bank officials are right in expecting the last rate hikes to come in early 2023—they could come sooner or later depending on the inflation and economic data and due to unforeseeable developments that may change the environment entirely. But the signal that rate hikes have come to an end by the central banks that led the rush to hike rates may be welcome news for stock market investors looking out to the coming year.

       "   'abstract': 'Although some recent economic data has been strong, the bigger picture is more nuanced.',\n",
       "   'content': 'The unexpectedly strong July jobs report belied considerable nuance in the broader economic picture. Leading economic indicators and an inverted U.S. Treasury yield curve—historically harbingers of recession—are showing pockets of weakness in the economy. The situation may be similar overseas. Although large overseas economies have fared better this year than many analysts had expected, there are risks to growth for the coming quarters, and Europe\\'s economy is still slowing. U.S. stocks and economy: Dodging false signals July\\'s jobs report was undoubtedly hot—wages grew 5.2% year-over-year, and the economy added 528,000 jobs, boosting total payrolls above their pre-COVID peak in February 2020. While bulls cheered these signs of apparent strength, those expecting the Federal Reserve to slow or halt the pace of interest rate hikes were cautious as further signs of labor market tightness emerged. Bulls may also have felt those payroll gains more than outweighed other deteriorating trends in the economy. However, growing payrolls and recessions aren’t mutually exclusive. There is historical precedent—like in the early 1970s—for continued job growth well after the start of a recession. Meanwhile, leading economic indicators aren\\'t suggesting a strong backdrop for the labor market. As shown in the chart below, The Conference Board\\'s Leading Economic Index (LEI) has fallen by nearly 2% over the past six months. Excluding the reaction to the pandemic, LEI hasn’t stumbled like this since August 2009. Such a decline is also consistent with prior periods when the economy was entering a recession. Leading economic indicators are turning Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg. Nonfarm payrolls as of 7/31/2022. LEI as of 6/30/2022. Y-axis is truncated at 3,000 and -3,000 to account for pandemic-related distortions. At this point in the economic cycle, it is critical to differentiate between leading and coincident economic indicators. The former—such as job-cut announcements and claims for unemployment insurance—are sending recession warnings. That has always occurred before payrolls—a coincident indicator—turned lower. It’s possible the stock market isn’t taking full account of the weakness in the labor market and broader economy. As shown below, Russell 3000 index constituents with the weakest earnings growth (i.e., negative or no earnings) have decisively outperformed their higher-quality peers since the most recent trough in mid-June. With the Fed aggressively hiking rates and the economy having slowed considerably, we don\\'t think such speculative segments of the market will continue to outperform. Weak profits, strong performance Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 8/5/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The strong performance of lower quality stocks could give the market a false sense of confidence in the health of the economy. In fact, investor sentiment has been frothy, as shown by the surge in SentimenTrader\\'s \"Dumb Money\" Confidence Index below. Some of that rise may be justified by decent breadth indicators, but leading economic data would need to turn higher before we could have confidence the recent gains are durable. Stretched sentiment—at either extreme—is never itself sufficient evidence that stocks are ripe for a reversal. Some investors may be waiting for a negative catalyst to come along and send stocks lower, but we think the market will face more pressure from slower growth and restrictive Fed policy. Sentiment turns frothier Source: Charles Schwab, SentimenTrader, as of 8/2/2022. SentimenTrader\\'s Smart Money Confidence and Dumb Money Confidence Indexes are used to see what the \"good\" market timers are doing with their money compared to what the \"bad\" market timers are doing and are presented on a scale of 0% to 100%. When the Smart Money Confidence Index is at 100%, it means that those most correct on market direction are 100% confident of a rising market. When it is at 0%, it means good market timers are 0% confident in a rally. The Dumb Money Confidence Index works in the opposite manner. Fixed income: All roads lead to yield curve inversion In its campaign to fight surging inflation, the Fed has raised the target range for the federal funds rate four times since this rate-hike cycle started in mid-March. The upper end of the range is now 2.5% compared to a starting level of 0.25%, making this one of the most rapid tightening cycles in over 40 years. At the same time, the pace at which assets roll off its balance sheet (i.e., quantitative tightening) is set to accelerate in September. With the annual inflation rate still at 8.5% and wage growth running at more than 5%, more rate hikes are likely on the horizon. The current market pricing suggests investors expect a peak in the federal funds rate of 3.6% in the first quarter of 2023, followed by a series of rate cuts that should bring the rate down to 3% by early 2024.

Note: The Consumer Price Index measures changes in the price level of consumer goods and services purchased by households. Core inflation (Core CPI) is a measure of inflation which excludes certain items that face volatile price movements, notably food and energy. That outlook may be too optimistic in terms of the Fed\\'s actions, but it reflects signs that inflation pressures are abating. Commodity prices have dropped sharply, inventories are rising relative to sales, the U.S. dollar is strong, and global economic growth has been soft. One of the outgrowths of rapid Fed tightening is an inverted yield curve, where short-term interest rates are higher than longer-term rates. By boosting short-term borrowing costs and reducing the liquidity available to the financial system, the Fed\\'s actions should slow economic growth and cool inflation down the road. In most tightening cycles, long-term yields lag the rise in short-term rates because bond yields reflect expectations about future growth and inflation, as well as the future path of the federal funds rate. The inversion of the yield curve in this cycle is one of the steepest in modern history. The yield spread between two-year and 10-year Treasuries, at about negative 40 basis points, has only been this low a few times in the past 40 years. However, there is no theoretical limit to how far it can fall. In the early 1980s, the spread was more than 200 basis points. The yield curve between short- and longer-term Treasuries is inverted Source: Bloomberg. Daily data as of 8/8/2022. Note: The rates are comprised of Market Matrix U.S. Generic spread rates (USYC2Y10)This spread is a calculated Bloomberg yield spread that replicates selling the current 2 year U.S. Treasury Note and buying the current 10 year U.S. Treasury Note, then factoring the differences by 100. An inverted yield curve has been a reliable signal of recession on the horizon in the past. Not all two-year/10-year inversions lead to recessions, but they have all led to some slowing in economic growth. The bottom line is that overall yield levels may continue to rise as the Fed tightens policy, but the faster the pace of rate hikes, the more likely it is that the yield curve will invert further. Global stocks and economy: Earnings recession? Large overseas economies are faring better than many had feared. Europe grew at an above-average pace in the first half of the year, with second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth coming in at an unexpectedly strong 2.8% on an annualized basis (following a rise of 2.0% in the first quarter). We won\\'t see Japan\\'s GDP growth data for a couple more weeks, but it is expected to come in at 3.6%. That would be a very strong rebound from the country’s 0.5% contraction in the first quarter. Looking ahead, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a widely watched global think tank, released updated forecasts for economic growth last week that showed Europe outpacing the U.S. this year and next, and Japan\\'s economy growing faster than the U.S. in 2023. Overseas economic growth has been stronger than expected Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 8/5/2022. Forecasts contained herein are for illustrative purposes only, may be based upon proprietary research and are developed through analysis of historical public data. 2Q22 GDP for Japan is the Bloomberg consensus forecast (preliminary GDP data to be released on 8/14). There are risks to growth for the coming quarters—particularly, the natural gas situation—and Europe\\'s economy is still slowing. Europe\\'s gas inventory continues to grow and is currently at 70% of capacity, which is normal for this time of year. However, the bloc must continue to build storage at least at a normal seasonal pace amid supply challenges. An inverted U.S. Treasury yield curve hasn’t just been a negative sign for the U.S. economy—historically, it has also augured global recessions. There are about 90 different U.S. Treasury yield spreads that compare every shorter maturity to longer active maturities. Rather than picking just one spread, like the two-year/10-year, looking at all of the spreads can tell us how much of the whole curve is inverted. As of early August, more than half of all yield curves had inverted. Percentage of U.S. yield curves inverted is now over 50% Source: Charles Schwab, Macrobond, US Department of Treasury data as of 8/8/2022. U.S. Breakeven 10 Year (USGGBE10 Index) and U.S. Breakeven 5 Year (USGGBE05 Index). Daily data as of 7/13/2022 The breakeven rate is the difference between the TIPS rate and the comparable-maturity Treasury rate, and is used as a gauge for what market participants believe inflation will be five or 10 years in the future. While the high and rising risk of an economic recession may not be news to investors, the yield curve could be signaling an earnings recession ahead. Although earnings held up well in the first half of the year, Wall Street analysts\\' forecasts continue to point to double-digit earnings growth over the next 12 months, which is very unusual during an economic recession. An earnings recession signaled by the yield curve could make market price-to-earnings ratios more vulnerable to a further pullback than they appear now. High-dividend-paying stocks may continue to reward should the economy and earnings continue to slow. Analysts expect double-digit earnings growth Source: Charles Schwab, MSCI, FactSet data as of 8/5/2022. Forecasts contained herein are for illustrative purposes only, may be based upon proprietary research and are developed through analysis of historical public data. Alternatively, if earnings growth remains resilient as inflation begins to subside in the second half of the year with excess inventory leading to price cuts, then stocks may recover. This is likely especially for those with the brightest earnings growth prospects and lowest price-to-earnings ratios, which tend to be more prevalent in the stock markets of Europe and Japan.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I have a friend who said that she used part of her IRA to buy her first home. Is that legit? And if so, will I have to pay a penalty? I\\'m only 30 years old. —A Reader Dear Reader, As prices (and down payments) for homes continue to escalate across the country, this is a great question. And the quick answer to your question is yes—the IRS does allow penalty-free withdrawals of up to $10,000 of IRA funds for first-time homebuyers. However, as enticing as this may be, taking that withdrawal comes with certain caveats you need to carefully consider—not only to avoid taxes and penalties, but perhaps more importantly, to make sure you\\'re not jeopardizing your future financial security. I\\'m always a little uncomfortable when people want to pull money out of their retirement accounts early for whatever reason, even if the IRS thinks it\\'s okay. But before we get into those concerns, let\\'s talk about the facts. Who\\'s considered a \"first-time\" homebuyer While IRA withdrawals before age 59 1/2 usually trigger a 10% penalty, there are exceptions—including the first-time homebuyer exemption. Making it even more tempting, the definition of a first-time homebuyer is broader than it sounds. It applies to your very first home purchase, of course, but it also applies if you or your spouse haven\\'t owned a principal residence at any time during the past two years. The operating word here is \"principal,\" because even if you\\'ve owned a vacation home during that time, the exemption can still apply. Also, you yourself don\\'t have to be the homebuyer. You can also qualify for the exemption if you\\'re helping your spouse, child, grandchild or parent buy a home. What you can withdraw What\\'s not so appealing is the limited amount you can withdraw. The maximum lifetime penalty-free withdrawal from an IRA under the homebuyer exemption is $10,000. While that\\'s a good chunk of money, it may not make much of a dent in your down payment if you live in an area where property values are high. That $10,000 limit is an absolute if you have a tax-deferred account like a traditional IRA. However, if you have a Roth IRA, you may have a little more leeway; you can always withdraw contributions to a Roth tax- and penalty-free. However, if you withdraw earnings from your Roth, you\\'re subject to the $10,000 limit. In addition, you and your spouse can qualify individually for the homebuyer exemption, potentially allowing a couple to withdraw up to $20,000 penalty-free. Taxes you may have to pay You may be thinking all this is very generous of the IRS, but it\\'s not that simple. The homebuyer exemption is penalty-free, but not necessarily tax-free. Again, the rules are different for traditional and Roth IRAs. With a traditional IRA, withdrawals are subject to ordinary income taxes—even the $10,000 withdrawal for a first home. With a Roth, withdrawals of contributions are always tax-free because you\\'ve already paid income taxes on that money. So are withdrawals of earnings of up to $10,000 under the homebuyer exemption, assuming you\\'ve had the Roth for five-plus years. If you\\'ve had the Roth for fewer than five years, you\\'ll pay taxes on the earnings withdrawal. And if you withdraw more than $10,000 in earnings, that money will be subject to both ordinary income taxes and the 10% penalty. As you can see, it can get complicated. If you\\'ve converted assets from a traditional IRA to a Roth, there\\'s even more to consider. Best to consult your tax advisor. What you can use the money for—and when Once the money is in your hands, the IRS wants to make sure you use it for the purpose intended. So the funds must be used for what is defined as qualified acquisition costs—the cost of buying, building or rebuilding a home plus any usual or reasonable settlement, financing or other closing costs. In addition, the funds must be used within 120 days of receiving the distribution. The bigger retirement savings question Being able to take money from your IRA for a down payment is one thing—whether it\\'s the right thing for you is another. I caution you to think carefully. Raiding your retirement account can have long-term consequences. You\\'re losing the tax-free growth over time, and you\\'re depleting something that you\\'ve worked hard to save. Look at the big picture and talk to your financial advisor. Make sure you\\'re doing the right thing not only in terms of present taxes and penalties, but also in terms of your future security.

       "   'content': 'It\\'s uncomfortably hot in much of the country; perhaps an apt way to describe last Friday\\'s employment report for July. As a reminder, the labor market is one of the two mandates of Federal Reserve policy decisions. Given the still-hot labor market, and still-hot inflation, the Fed\\'s dual mandate may be better described as dueling mandates. July\\'s headline payrolls were much stronger than expected at 528k vs. the consensus expectation of 250k. Not a single economist as part of the consensus had a number anywhere near that high. In addition, there were positive revisions to the prior two months to the tune of an additional 28k jobs. As a result, payrolls have finally surpassed their pre-pandemic peak, as shown below. Payrolls > prior peak Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), as of 7/31/2022. Reaction mechanisms In addition, average hourly earnings were also higher than expected at 0.5% month/month and 5.2% year/year. A still-hot labor market alongside strong wage growth (albeit negative when adjusting for inflation) suggests inflation won\\'t come fully off the boil until sufficient labor market slack is seen for a sustained period. In keeping with those thoughts, expectations for a 75-basis-point hike at the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting jumped immediately after the jobs report was released. In addition, the notion of a coming \"Fed pivot,\" which contributed to the recent market rally, likely needs to be dismissed—at least for now. Bond yields across the curve spiked (especially two-year and three-year yields), leading to a further inversion of the curve (only the 10-year-three-month spread remains positive). The descent of 100 basis points in the 10-year yield—from its near 3.5% peak in mid-June to its recent low of 2.5% as August began—was also a key contributor to the strength in the equity market (the S&P 500\\'s recent trough was in mid-June). A more aggressive Fed, alongside yields rising swiftly, again helps to explain the initial swoon in stocks that followed the release of the jobs report. Household survey a tell looking ahead? The household survey, from which the unemployment rate is calculated, was significantly more tepid with a gain of 179k (following a drop of 315k the prior month). The unemployment rate\\'s drop of only one-tenth to 3.5% was partly explained by a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate (LFPR). For what it\\'s worth, at economic turning points, the household survey has been a better indicator of labor market health than the payroll survey. As shown below, using a six-month rolling average to highlight the trend, the household survey is telling a less-robust labor market story. A tale of two surveys Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 7/31/2022. Y-axis is truncated for visuals purposes. As mentioned (and shown below), there was a drop in the LFPR; at 62.1%, it is at its lowest level since last December. However, better news came via its prime age (25-54) category, which did tick higher. As an aside, I suppose I\\'m well past my prime since my 58th birthday is approaching quickly, while Kevin is at the start of his prime! Lacking participation Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 7/31/2022. What say the leading indicators? Part of the reason for the miss on the part of economists (economic data doesn\\'t \"miss\"…economists miss the mark with their estimates) is that a broad swath of leading labor market data has been signaling a faltering labor market. In particular, initial unemployment claims (a key leading economic indicator) are up about 50% from their March low—well above the average lead-in to recessions historically, as shown below. Claims\\' warning? Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Department of Labor, as of 7/29/2022. Y-axis truncated for visual purposes. As noted, claims are a component of The Conference Board\\'s Leading Economic Index (LEI), which has rolled over this year.

Job openings have rolled over, too, as shown via the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data below. Openings continue to outpace the number of people unemployed—even accounting for the fact that openings are likely overstated based on how they\\'re calculated, and lag other labor market data by at least a full month. Openings rolling over Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unemployed as of 7/31/2022. JOLTS as of 6/30/2022. Also fooling economists, layoff announcements are up meaningfully from their 2021 lows. As shown below, three out of the past four months have seen year-over-year increases in job-cut announcements, while the anecdotal data continues to bode fairly ill (notably within the technology sector). Job-cut announcements turn \"positive\" Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 7/31/2022. As shown in the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) charts in another section below, although both services and manufacturing headline indexes remain in expansion territory (>50), their employment components are decidedly weaker. Another rub is that strong job growth coupled with weak gross domestic product (GDP) growth (or no growth in the case of the first and second quarter this year) is a sign of weak/weakening productivity, which in turn bodes ill for corporate profits and margins. A less-sweltering inflation forecast? As noted, the Fed\\'s other mandate (inflation) is facing a similar backdrop as the labor market—with the difference of course being that we would welcome a significant drop in inflation but not a spike in job losses. While coincident indicators—such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI)—indicate price growth is still running hot, leading indicators are telling (or attempting to tell) a different story. It remains encouraging that gasoline, energy-related commodity, and shipping prices have rolled over, but the unfortunate reality is that consumers are reeling from a 40-year high in inflation that is increasingly being driven by stickier services components. Shown in the chart below, CPI (as of June) increased at a 9.1% annual rate. As the pace picked up throughout the pandemic, core services (which excludes energy) has become the chief driver, contributing 3.2 percentage points to headline inflation. That\\'s an (unfortunately) impressive feat when considering that Energy contributed 3 percentage points to CPI’s 9.1% gain in June—a month in which oil prices were hovering firmly above $100/barrel. Unwelcome services force Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 6/30/2022. Core excludes food and energy. As mentioned, commodity prices have experienced a significant decline over the past couple months. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the recent peak in gasoline prices occurred in mid-June (oil prices have also slid considerably in that timeframe), alongside the aforementioned peak in the 10-year yield and the most recent trough for the S&P 500. Price action has started to cement expectations that the peak in headline inflation may be behind us. While it\\'s never possible to predict where prices will go—especially in this environment—there is building and perhaps sufficient evidence that the worst of the pandemic- and war-driven inflationary pressure is in the rearview mirror. As shown below, the shipping rate for a 40-foot freight container from Shanghai to Los Angeles has plunged by nearly 40% from a year earlier. That is the lowest year-over-year change since the pandemic erupted and well off the high of more than 240% last year. Notably, the price level isn\\'t back to its pre-pandemic low, but it\\'s the rate of change that matters more. Pay (less) extra for shipping Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 8/4/2022. The World Container Index (WCI) assessed by Drewry reports actual spot container freight rates for major East West trade routes. Additionally, the prices paid and supplier deliveries components of both ISM surveys—as shown below—have come off the boil. The upside is that this bodes well for the pass-through (or lack thereof) of higher costs to consumers; but, as mentioned earlier, the employment components of both manufacturing and services are not signaling future strength on the labor front. Weak prices, weaker labor Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 7/31/2022. Supply-demand tug of war Even though headwinds for headline inflation are building, the metric that the Fed pays most attention to is the Core Price Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation index. The current 4.8% year-over-year increase is fortunately down from the February peak of 5.3%, but it\\'s uncomfortably above the 1.9% rate at the start of the pandemic and the Fed\\'s flexible target of 2%. The persistent difficulty throughout the pandemic for the Fed has been navigating an inflation environment that is increasingly driven by supply-side factors. To be sure, demand-driven components have borne responsibility as monetary and fiscal policy were incredibly accommodative at the start of the pandemic; but ripple effects from the pandemic and war in Europe have exacerbated price pressures to the upside throughout the world. As such, demand- and supply-driven contributions to core PCE have been nearly equal, as shown in the chart below. Meet in the middle Source: Charles Schwab, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (Supply- and Demand-Driven PCE Inflation – Economic Research (frbsf.org)), as of 6/30/2022. Figure divides year-over-year changes in core PCE inflation (using authors\\' calculations) into contributions that can be determined as driven by supply and demand, with remainder marked as ambiguous. Demand-driven categories are identified as those where an unexpected change in price moves in the same direction as the change in quantity in a given month. Supply-driven categories are identified as those where unexpected changes in price and quantity move in opposite directions. Gotta break even While the Fed has openly admitted to its inability to rein in supply-driven inflation, it has acted swiftly and aggressively to tamp down demand, evidenced by the several-hundred basis points\\' worth of policy rate increases this year (and the prospect of further tightening). The light at the end of the inflation tunnel may be visible, but the key moving forward is less about the timing of the peak, and more about the level at which inflation ultimately settles. If it stays elevated and takes longer to cool—which will grow more likely if core services (the stickier component) climbs higher—that will help push the Fed to keep its foot on the brakes. One of the silver linings for now is that inflation expectations have rolled over, dispelling the notion that individuals expect higher prices to persist for several years to come. As shown below, two- and 10-year inflation breakeven rates are off their peaks of 4.9% and 3%, respectively. Put simply, the market doesn\\'t expect today\\'s sky-high inflation to last long into the future. That gives the Fed some cover, but it\\'s hardly enough (as several members have reminded us) to halt rate hikes in the near term. Inflation expectations subdued Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 8/5/2022. In sum While the hot July jobs report has likely given the Fed sufficient reason to maintain a hawkish stance in the near term, it is worth noting that two CPI prints and another jobs report stand between now and the next rate decision (barring any inter-meeting surprises). As such, July\\'s strong wage growth and further evidence of labor market tightness might prove to be stale if inflation starts to ease and payrolls in August (a month that is notorious for large subsequent revisions) show some weakness. Even if inflation looks to be peaking and rolling over, the Fed has made it clear that price pressures today remain uncomfortably high. Not only does that keep a 75-basis-point rate hike on the table for September, it increases the potential duration of the rate hiking cycle in the future. Assessing each inflation and jobs report has gotten increasingly difficult given the Fed\\'s relatively new practice of making meeting-by-meeting decisions on policy. However, that reinforces the fact that investors should focus more on the big picture for policy. Macro forces are still unsupportive of stronger economic growth or equity performance, thus keeping pressure on further gains and elevating the probability of a recession.'},\n",

World Currency Ranker (WCRS). Data from 8/2/2021 to 8/2/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. We\\'ve long been dollar bulls, but after such steep gains, we see some scope for a near-term decline and slower pace of appreciation due to slowing U.S. economic growth. Nonetheless, we look for dollar strength to continue longer term. A trifecta of factors support the dollar—the relatively strong performance of the U.S. economy, tightening monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, and safe-haven buying. These look likely to remain intact into 2023. Moreover, there are few attractive alternatives to the U.S. dollar for global investors. Factors supporting dollar strength remain intact The value of a freely traded currency tends to reflect the prospects for the return on investment in that country\\'s assets. Consequently, strong economic growth tends to produce a rising currency. The U.S. economic recovery, aided by strong fiscal and monetary stimulus, has outpaced recoveries in most other major countries since the pandemic. In nominal terms, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) now stands 15.6% higher compared to the third quarter of 2019, even after the slight drop in the first half of this year. That compares to the Eurozone\\'s increase of just 8.3% over the same period, while Japan\\'s GDP is 3.6% below its 3Q 2019 level. U.S. GDP growth has outpaced GDP growth in Europe and Japan Source: Bloomberg. GDP US Nominal Dollars SAAR (GDP CUR$ Index) as of Q22022, Eurozone Nominal GDP (Billion USD) SAAR (ECOXEAS Index) as of Q12022, and Japan GDP at Current Prices Seasonally Adjusted: GDP Quarterly (JGDOSGDP Index) as of Q12022. Percent change in nominal GDP normalized from 9/30/2019. Looking forward, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war is weighing heavily on Europe\\'s outlook, while China\\'s COVID-19-related shutdowns and property market weakness are holding back growth in Asia. Even with the recent weak GDP growth, the U.S. still looks better positioned to weather a global economic slowdown. Interest rate differentials reflect this relative economic strength, adding to the dollar\\'s appeal. Due to the Federal Reserve\\'s aggressive pace of rate hikes, yields on U.S. Treasuries are significantly higher than in most G-7 countries, aside from a few commodity-producing countries. If the Fed follows through on further rate hikes this year as expected, short-term interest rate differentials will likely widen further as U.S. yields rise more rapidly than yields in other countries. Currency hedging costs may reduce the attractiveness of U.S. bonds for some foreign investors, but net foreign investment flows into the U.S. continue to be positive and domestic investors have little reason to shift money abroad.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Fed tightening cycles tend to be particularly negative for emerging-market countries. This cycle has been one of the most damaging. Many EM countries and companies issued dollar-denominated debt over the past few years when borrowing costs were low and investors were eager to take risk to get more yield. Today, issuers trying to service that debt with a weaker currency at higher interest rates may struggle, leading to downgrades or defaults. In addition, investors who borrowed in U.S. dollars to invest in higher-yielding EM currencies—a strategy known as the \"carry trade\"—have seen steep losses. A negative cycle has unfolded where capital outflows send EM currencies lower, leading their central banks to raise interest rates to stem the outflows, resulting in weaker growth. Not surprisingly, EM bonds—both U.S dollar (USD)-denominated and those issued in local currency—have produced sharply negative returns in the fixed income market over the past year. EM bond returns have been negative Source: Bloomberg. Bloomberg Emerging Market USD Aggregate Bond Index (EMUSTRUU Index). Total returns based on daily data between 12/31/2020 to 8/2/2022. Total returns assume reinvestment of interest and capital gains. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The third factor supporting the dollar is safe-haven inflows. In times of economic and political turmoil, investors historically have moved to the U.S. dollar for safety and liquidity. The U.S. Treasury market is one of the largest and most liquid markets in the world, with strong legal protections, where investors are confident that they can access their money at any time. Inflows have slowed this year, largely because of a drop in holdings by China. However, the overall trend remains firm. Rising short-term Treasury yields make holding dollars intended for safekeeping more attractive. Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries remain high Source: Bloomberg. U.S. Treasury Major Foreign Holders Total (HOLDTOT Index). Monthly data as of May 2022. No alternative to dollar dominance The dollar is likely to remain the dominant currency in the global economy for the foreseeable future. Despite long-held concerns about swelling U.S. trade and budget deficits, demand for dollars remains strong for global transactions and trade. About 40% of global financial transactions are settled in U.S. dollars and the majority of commodities—from oil to soybeans—are traded in U.S. dollars.1 Importers of those goods need to hold dollars for trade purchases. Exporters tend to hold funds in short-term U.S. Treasuries for future transactions. The size and liquidity of the U.S. Treasury market provides a stable backdrop for global trade and investment. There simply aren\\'t many alternatives to the dollar that will fill these needs. The euro plays a large role in financial transactions, but its fragmented bond markets and long period of negative interest rates have limited its usage. Japan\\'s zero-interest-rate and yield-curve-control policies make it unappealing. There is always speculation about China\\'s yuan becoming more prominent as a global currency, but it\\'s not even freely convertible due to capital controls. Implications of a strong dollar A strong dollar helps hold down domestic inflation, by lowering the cost of imported goods. Every dollar buys more goods and services as it rises. Since the U.S. is a large net importer, a 14% rise in the dollar can have a measurable impact on inflation. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland estimated that a 1% rise in the dollar typically lowers non-petroleum import prices by 0.3% cumulatively over six months. A proportion of that drop passes through to lower overall inflation. It\\'s no surprise that there has been little pushback from the Treasury or the Fed about the dollar\\'s recent sharp appreciation. For investors, the combination of a rising dollar and high U.S. interest rates make maintaining a globally diversified bond portfolio challenging. The yield to worst on the Bloomberg Global Aggregate ex US Index is only 1.84% with a with a duration of 7.6, compared to a yield of 3.42% for the U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (Agg) with a duration of 6.3. When factoring in the 14% increase in the dollar and the yield differential, the broad international index has dropped 18% over the past year, about twice that of the U.S. index. Global Agg yield to worst is lower than for the U.S. Agg Source: Bloomberg. Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Total Return Index and Bloomberg Global Aggregate (x-USD) Total Return Bond Index (LBUSTRUU Index, LG38TRUU Index). Daily data as of 8/3/2022, 3:40pm ET. Yield to worst is a measure of the lowest possible yield that can be received on a bond that fully operates within the terms of its contract without defaulting. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Emerging-market bonds have also been among the worst performers in the fixed income universe over the past year. Yields are now significantly higher and may provide some opportunities longer term, but an environment of tightening Fed policy, shrinking global liquidity and a rising dollar doesn\\'t tend to favor EM bond returns. Overall, the factors driving dollar strength look likely to persist into next year. We suggest investors keep allocations to non-U.S. fixed income securities to a minimum. 1 Research has shown that a 1% change in the trade-weighted U.S. dollar index typically lowers nonpetroleum import prices by 0.3% cumulatively over six months, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, \"Exchange-rate pass-through and U.S. prices,\" March 24, 2015.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"In July, we witnessed a major turnaround in the stock market despite aggressive rate hikes and mounting evidence of a recession. Stock markets around the world bounced back, posting the best month since 2020, led by economically sensitive sectors (often called cyclicals) like Consumer Discretionary, Information Technology and Industrials. In contrast, sectors that usually fare better in recessions (referred to as defensives), such as Consumer Staples and Health Care, lagged the overall market. While July was a nice break from the downtrend, if markets return to favoring stocks that tend to outperform during recessionary bear markets, investors may want to consider high-dividend-paying stocks. High-dividend payers High-dividend-paying stocks have been outpacing the overall stock market this year in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, except during July. Both the S&P 500 High Dividend Index and MSCI Europe High Dividend Index have delivered positive total returns for the year through the end of July, while the S&P 500 is down 13% and MSCI Europe Index is down 7% (as measured in euros).

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. It's not clear that stock markets can sustain July's upward momentum and may rotate back to the leadership we had seen in the first half of the year. Support for this view includes concerns over an ongoing slide in economic activity while central banks continue to tighten monetary policy in response to inflation. If that is the case, there may be grounds for renewed focus on dividend payers, which have often offered investors some refuge during recessionary bear markets of the past. Risks One of the risks of dividend investing is sector concentration. Companies in the Utilities and Consumer Staples sectors tend to pay much higher dividends than companies in other sectors. Seeking high-dividend payers without considering sector allocation can result in a lack of diversification, potentially making a portfolio more vulnerable during periods of high volatility. Fortunately, a focus on high-dividend-paying stocks doesn't have to mean abandoning sector diversification. High-dividend payers can be found in all sectors and have been outpacing the market in nearly all of them. The table below shows the performance so far this year for the MSCI World Index sectors ranked by dividend yield. The stocks with the highest dividend yields are the best performers in every sector, except Energy and Utilities. High-dividend payers outperforming in nearly every sector Source: Charles Schwab, FactSet data, year-to-date performance through 7/30/2022. Performance of the MSCI World, by sector. Green signifies best-performing dividend yield quintile in sector, red signifies the worst. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Another risk of high-dividend investing is the risk of those dividends being cut. That scenario specifically contributed to high-dividend-paying stocks underperforming during the 2008-09 recessionary bear market. Investors can monitor this risk through reviewing the four most popular ratios for measuring a company's ability to pay its dividend. Those more vulnerable to a dividend cut have a high dividend-payout ratio, low dividend-coverage ratio, low free-cash-flow-to-equity, and high net-debt-to-EBITDA. While the vast majority of high-dividend payers pass these tests, they are backward-looking assessments. Fortunately, despite the ongoing economic downturn, companies are relatively cash-rich right now, likely making dividend cuts less of a risk than in past recessions. History shows us the benefits of a focus on high-dividend payers during recessionary bear markets, as you can see in the chart below. In every recessionary bear market of the past 50 years high-dividend-paying stocks have outperformed the overall market, except for the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-09, when financials were forced to eliminate their dividends.

Owning high-dividend-paying stocks doesn't mean losses have been avoided during most of these periods, but it can make a sizable difference in downside protection—as it has this year. July bounce In June, we pointed out that the risk of a deep recession seemed to be priced into market internals, so a significant rebound in cyclicals for July (as economic data reflected only a mild downturn) is not that surprising. We can find evidence of this in relative performance of cyclicals in Europe and the widely watched manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI). The performance of cyclicals relative to defensives seemed to price in the expectation for a sudden, deep drop in the PMI to below 40, not far from the low point during the pandemic recession of 2020 when manufacturing activity was sharply cut off. Yet, the preliminary reading for July came in at 49.8—a reading consistent with a stall in manufacturing, but not a contraction. The mispricing, combined with some evidence inflation pressures are beginning to ease, has helped cyclicals to bounce and lead the market higher in July. Cyclicals bounce in July as data not as bad as feared Source: Charles Schwab. S&P Global, Bloomberg data as of 7/30/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. While there is still a gap between the relative performance of cyclicals and the current level of the PMI, there is still the likelihood of a further slide in the PMI over the coming months. The building of excess inventories at retailers (Shortages Have Led to Gluts) and at manufacturers (chart below) to the highest levels in decades suggests a further slowdown in orders, production, and jobs. Inventory glut Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 7/30/2022. Index readings above 50 indicate expansion, readings below 50 indicate contraction. Dividends make a comeback As the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond climbed above the dividend yield for most stocks early this year, many investors wrote off the idea of focusing on stocks' yields. But dividend payers have deserved attention this year and may continue to reward investors looking for some defense should the economy continue to slow.

       "   'content': 'As expected, the Federal Reserve raised its target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 2.25% to 2.5%, citing high inflation as its primary concern. The increase brings the fed funds rate to the Fed’s estimate of the \"neutral rate\"—one that it estimates to be low enough to accommodate a growing economy but high enough to limit inflation to around 2%. As inflation is running far above 2%, the Fed is indicating it will likely keep hiking rates despite widespread signs of slowing economic growth. The Fed is also continuing its \"quantitative tightening\" (QT) program—reducing the size of its balance sheet by letting bonds it holds mature without reinvestment. The pace of QT will begin to pick up in September as the Fed allows more bonds to \"roll off\" its balance sheet. Outlook for the economy softens While acknowledging that spending and production have softened, and the inflationary impact of rising energy and food prices due to the Russia-Ukraine war is beyond its reach, the Fed\\'s view is that job growth is still \"robust\" enough to prevent inflation from receding. Consequently, its focus is on slowing the demand side of the economy. The big question is: How high rates will need to go to restore price stability? Currently, the market is pricing in a peak in the federal funds rate of about 3.4% later this year or in the first quarter of next year, and then a decline later in in 2023. Markets are pricing in a peak fed funds rate of 3.4% Although the FOMC statement and the SEP pointed to the possible avoidance of a recession, we have a less benign view and believe the soft landing ship may have already sailed. The tightening in financial conditions continues to point to a meaningful economic slowdown; first-quarter real GDP growth was already negative, and now expectations for second-quarter growth are at the zero line. Powell reinforced that the Fed is \"not trying to induce a recession,\" but it may be a necessary ingredient in the lower inflation recipe. Source: Bloomberg, as of 7/27/2022. Market estimate of the federal funds using Fed Funds Futures Implied Rate (FFM2 COMB Comdty). For illustrative purposes only. Please read the Risk Disclosure for Futures and Options prior to trading futures products. Futures accounts are not protected by SIPC. The Fed\\'s recent estimates are slightly higher. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants submit quarterly projections about the economy and the path of the federal funds rate; the median projection for the fed funds rate in 2022 and 2023 was 3.4% and 3.8%, respectively, at the June meeting. This suggests that the committee believes it may need to hike rates by roughly 100 basis points (or a full percentage point) above that \"neutral rate\" to restore price stability. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that the committee would like to see a sustained period of lower monthly inflation readings before easing up on its policy tightening. Path forward The Fed is likely to continue talking tough on fighting inflation to prevent inflation expectations from rising. We believe the message is that it is willing to risk triggering a recession in order to restore price stability. Although a recession isn\\'t the goal, the Fed may already have tightened enough for one to develop. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first half of the year was flat or maybe even negative, financial conditions have tightened significantly, leading indicators have declined for four consecutive months, and the yield curve is inverting—all signs that a recession may be looming.

A breakeven rate is the difference between the yield of a TIPS and the yield of a traditional Treasury with a comparable maturity. That difference is what inflation would need to average over the life of the TIPS for the it to outperform the traditional Treasury. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Given the growing evidence that economic growth is slowing, we expect the pace and magnitude of Fed rate hikes to slow going forward. The next FOMC meeting is in September – a longer-than-usual stretch. Between now and then, the most important indicators to watch will be the two CPI and PCE reports, along with consumer spending and job growth. Our best guess at this time is that the next rate hike will be 50 bps. Market outlook As long as the Fed maintains its inflation-fighting stance, the major trend in the fixed income market is likely further inversion of the yield curve. The Treasury yield curve is already inverted for maturities of 2 years through 10 years.

Summing it up There is a risk that bond yields rise from here since they have fallen so fast lately—another move to the 3% to 3.25% range for the 10-year Treasury yield can\\'t be ruled out. Longer-term, we expect any rise in yields to be limited given expectations for a peak Fed funds rate of just 3.4%. We suggest investors consider adding some duration—exposure to interest rate risk—to their portfolios rather than waiting for the Fed to keep hiking rates. Bond ladders can be an effective way to invest today. Additionally, we do favor an up-in-quality bias given the economic growth concerns, focusing on Treasuries and investment grade municipal and corporate bonds. We\\'re more cautious on the riskier parts of the market, like high-yield bonds and emerging market debt, as tighter financial conditions and slower growth could pull their prices lower.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I\\'m planning to continue to work past age 65, and wondering if I should stick with my employer\\'s health insurance or move over to Medicare. How do I decide? —A Reader Dear Reader, This is becoming a common question as more and more people decide to work past age 65. In fact, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2020, 26.6 percent of people aged 65-74 remained in the workforce—and those numbers are projected to continue to grow. This can be seen as a positive since it means we\\'re redefining aging. At the same time, though, adequate health insurance remains essential. So it\\'s an important question—and the answer largely depends on the size of your employer, as well as the cost and coverage of your current plan as compared to Medicare. You\\'ll need to familiarize yourself with the pertinent Medicare regulations and deadlines to ensure the most seamless transition—whether that happens at age 65 or later. Also realize that once you file for Social Security, you\\'re automatically enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B when you turn 65. However, you have the option to opt out of Part B, which you may want to do if you (or your spouse) are covered by an employer plan. If you haven\\'t filed for Social Security, you can choose to enroll in just Medicare Part A or both Parts A and B (your Initial Enrollment Period is three months before you turn 65 until three months after your 65th birthday). Alternatively, you can postpone enrolling until you stop working. Let\\'s take a look at some Medicare basics as well as some of the factors that can help you decide. Medicare Part A—an easy choice Medicare Part A provides hospital insurance. It covers in-patient hospital stays, care in a skilled nursing facility, hospice care and some home care. Most people benefit by enrolling in Medicare Part A at age 65, whether or not they continue to work. There are no premiums, and enrolling now will help you avoid gaps in coverage down the road. Medicare Part B—it depends on the size of your employer Medicare Part B covers doctors\\' services, outpatient care, medical supplies and preventive services. The primary consideration in deciding if you need Part B is how many employees work at your company. If your company has 20 or more employees, your company would remain your primary insurer and you can delay enrolling in Part B without worrying about a late-enrollment penalty or lapse of coverage. When you leave your job, you then have eight months to sign up for Part B under a Special Enrollment Period. If your company has fewer than 20 employees, Medicare is considered your primary insurer, whether you\\'ve enrolled in Medicare or not. Your company plan is the secondary, which means that your employer plan won\\'t pay for anything that\\'s assumed to be covered by Medicare. If you don\\'t sign up for Part B as soon as you\\'re eligible, you may have to pay a penalty, and there could be a delay in coverage. Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage)—an alternative to Original Medicare When you enroll in Medicare, you have the option to choose a Medicare Advantage plan as an alternative to Original Medicare, which includes Medicare A and B. Medicare Advantage is a type of Medicare health plan offered by a private company that provides all Part A and B benefits. On the plus side, a Medicare Advantage plan also usually provides Part D (prescription drug) benefits as well as sometimes providing extras like vision and dental at a lower total cost. On the minus side, you generally have to choose doctors within a particular medical network and get a referral to see a specialist. Another caveat: in some cases, joining a Medicare Advantage plan could cause you to lose your employer plan. Be sure to check with your benefits administrator. Medicare Part D—drug coverage has to be \"creditable\" Part D covers prescription drugs. If your employer plan offers what Medicare calls \"creditable\" (as good as or better than the coverage provided by Medicare\\'s prescription drug benefit) coverage, you may be able to delay enrolling in a Part D plan. If you don\\'t have this type of coverage and don\\'t enroll as soon as you\\'re eligible, there\\'s a late enrollment penalty if you go more than 63 days without prescription drug coverage. Some important considerations before making your choice If you work for a large company, compare your employer coverage and costs with Medicare. Be sure to look carefully at premiums for Parts B and D (both have high-income premium surcharges) as well as the cost of a Medigap policy that would cover whatever Original Medicare doesn\\'t (you should not purchase Medigap if you choose Medicare Advantage). If you\\'re happy with your current plan, you may well be better off staying with that and delaying Medicare enrollment until you retire. Another thing to be aware of is that once you enroll in Medicare (even if it\\'s just Part A), you\\'re no longer eligible to contribute to a health savings account (HSA). Therefore, if you want to continue to boost pre-tax savings with an HSA, you may want to postpone. In fact, to avoid an IRS penalty, you must stop contributions to an HSA 6 months prior to enrolling in Medicare Part A or claiming Social Security (SS) benefits after age 65. If you work for a small company, you should probably sign up for Parts A, B, and D as soon as you\\'re eligible. In this case, you most likely won\\'t need a Medigap policy under Original Medicare, since your employer coverage will pick up costs not covered by Medicare. Check with your employer to see the impact of enrolling in Medicare Advantage. A word about spousal benefits If you\\'re married and your spouse is covered by your employer plan, you\\'ll have to consider what choices your spouse would have if you switch to Medicare. These may include COBRA, purchasing individual coverage in the private market, or through a government exchange at www.healthcare.gov. To me, your ultimate decision comes down to a cost/benefit analysis. Medicare.gov does a good job of explaining different scenarios for those eligible for Medicare while still employed. Check that out and also talk to your employer\\'s benefits administrator.

       "   'abstract': 'Second-quarter earnings growth will mark an expected deceleration in profits, but focus will likely continue to shift to the pace at which outlooks are downgraded.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Focus on the second quarter has been particularly acute of late, not least due to expectations of a continued slowdown in both gross domestic product (GDP) and corporate earnings growth. As of July 19th, the Atlanta Fed is estimating that GDP declined by 1.6% (quarter-over-quarter at an annualized rate) in the second quarter. That would mark the second consecutive quarterly decline (as a reminder, that is not the definition of a recession), which hasn\\'t happened since the pandemic-induced recession in early 2020. Per Refinitiv, the \"blended\" year-over-year growth rate for second-quarter S&P 500 earnings is 6.1% (blended refers to the combination of actual earnings for companies that have already reported, and consensus estimates for companies yet to report). Excluding the Energy sector, earnings are expected to decline by 3.3%, the first contraction in ex-Energy growth since the third quarter of 2020. Of the 107 companies that have reported, 74.8% have reported above analyst estimates, which compares to a long-term average of 66% and the prior four quarters\\' average of 81%. At the sector level, results have thus far been mixed and, as you can see in the table below, underscore a slowdown. Sectors such as Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Communication Services are expected to see another decline in growth, and rates for traditional defensives like Consumer Staples, Health Care, and Utilities have come down sharply. The slowdown continues Source: Charles Schwab, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, as of 7/25/2022. Forecasts contained herein are for illustrative purposes only, may be based upon proprietary research and are developed through analysis of historical public data. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. As we\\'ve noted for the better part of the past year, the best days for earnings growth are certainly behind us. Sky-high double-digit growth rates were unsustainable (earnings growth reached a peak of 96% in the second quarter of 2021), and the bar was set quite low for a good portion of the rebound coming out of the worst phases of the pandemic. Not only have analysts now kept the bar too high, but the macro environment has shifted unfavorably for the market, helping send major indexes into bear territory this year. As you can see in the chart below, year-over-year changes in price and earnings growth have tracked closely over the past two decades. While the market\\'s plunge into negative terrain doesn\\'t suggest overall earnings growth must go negative, we still think there are risks to the downside. Plus, as mentioned, the growth rate excluding the Energy sector (which is expected to see triple-digit percentage profit gains) is in the red. Following directions Source: Charles Schwab, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, as of 7/25/2022. 4Q08\\'s reading of -67% is truncated at -40%, 4Q09\\'s reading of 206% is truncated at 80%, and 2Q21\\'s reading of 96% is truncated at 60%. Forecasts contained herein are for illustrative purposes only, may be based upon proprietary research and are developed through analysis of historical public data. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. In keeping with the trend over the past year-and-a-half, investors have been rewarding companies that are beating estimates, while punishing those that have missed. As shown in the chart below, the average S&P 500 member has outperformed the broader index by 0.5% when beating analysts\\' expectations, while the average decline for a miss has amounted to -2.3%. Don\\'t miss Source: Charles Schwab, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, as of 7/22/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The beat/miss trend thus far shows that the market has grown less excited (in comparison to the first quarter) about companies outpacing estimates. While we still have a considerable portion of the reporting season ahead of us, price action for now suggests that attention will continue to shift to the strength of companies\\' outlooks as opposed to how well they performed in the second quarter. In other words, forward-looking guidance and revisions have taken over as drivers of market action, especially with heightened fears of a looming recession. The math of long revision(s) Among the reasons for expectations of a less-than-rosy backdrop for earnings growth is the significant downshift in positive earnings revisions. As shown in the chart below, the share of S&P 500 members with positive three-month revisions has fallen by a significant degree over the past year (from nearly 70% to just above 30%). Higher input costs, the sharp increase in interest rates, and waning consumer demand have weighed on the number of upgrades; unfortunately, that historically portends weakness for both the market and corporate earnings. To be sure, the percentage of positive revisions hasn\\'t fallen to prior recessionary troughs, but the speed of the decline has been notable and bears watching if downward momentum persists. Positive revisions fading Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 7/22/2022. Zooming in on individual sector revisions for the current quarter, perhaps unsurprisingly, Energy is leading in upgrades while Tech commands the largest share of downgrades. Energy\\'s strength comes courtesy of the rise in oil prices and lingering (though fading) positive impact from the broader reopening of the economy. For growth-dominated Tech and its peers (Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary), upgrades have faded—not least because of the sharp hit those sectors are facing from higher rates and the unwinding of the stay-at-home trade. It\\'s worth noting that the Consumer Staples sector is near the bottom of the revisions leaderboard. Traditionally considered a defensive play in bear markets, it has come under immense pressure as higher costs and compressed profit margins have weighed on companies\\' outlooks. Increasingly sour forward guidance bears watching as the reporting season continues, especially because the sector\\'s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has surpassed the S&P 500\\'s forward P/E by nearly the widest margin in history. It might be a defensive play, but it comes at a price. Energy gains steam Source: Charles Schwab, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, as of 7/22/2022. Goldilocks (for now) and the three bears For virtually the entire year to date, the S&P 500\\'s decline has been driven by multiple contraction. P/E ratios have been crushed, led by growth-oriented sectors that were incredibly expensive at the beginning of the year. It\\'s a textbook move when considering the environment of hotter inflation and an aggressively hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed). With valuations now having corrected sharply, attention has shifted to what lies ahead for the E in the P/E. Our forward earnings data begins in 1990, which allows us to measure the trajectory of estimates in the past three bear markets—that is, those that came before the COVID bear, which was far too swift and sharp to use as a fair comparison. As shown in the chart below, the current earnings path is strikingly similar to the one seen in the early-2000s dotcom bust. Though the market peaked in March 2000, it wasn\\'t until September of that year that forward earnings growth peaked (it didn\\'t bottom until January 2002). Forward earnings growth corrected much faster after the market\\'s peak during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and 1990 recession. What kind of bear? Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 7/22/2022. Data indexed to 100 at the start of each bear market. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Any study of prior bear markets and recessions always warrants the disclaimer that the sample size with which we are working is incredibly small—not to mention the fact that each downturn has its own unique set of flavors. Indeed, the recessions in 1990 and 2001 were nearly identical in duration; yet the S&P 500\\'s maximum drawdown in 1990 was -20%, while it fell by -49% at its worst point in 2002. Conversely, the maximum drawdown during the GFC was -57%, and the severity of the recession was of a completely different (and disastrous) scale in terms of duration and depth. One leg down, one to go? Earnings season will heat up quickly this week but results thus far suggest growth in the second quarter will look underwhelming in relative and absolute terms. Though forward earnings estimates have started to crest, we are likely still in the early phases of the downgrade cycle. Stocks\\' weakness thus far may have priced in some of the declines in second-quarter profits, but what matters more is how much companies see their bottom lines getting hit later this year—a risk that may be the driver of the next bout of weakness for stocks. The unwinding of the stay-at-home bubble, coupled with a still-hot 40-year high in inflation and the Fed\\'s aggressive rate hikes, has exacerbated the economy\\'s deceleration this year. Growth in profit margins has been arrested, and with demand now stalling (or outright contracting) in certain sectors, hiring freezes and layoffs have gained steam. If demand falls at a faster rate and inflation takes longer to subside, earnings will undoubtedly be at further risk. As a broader downshift in growth expectations has come to fruition, high-quality segments of the market have maintained their standing as consistent havens. We think their leadership will persist, and thus continue to encourage stock-picking-oriented investors to focus on factors such as positive earnings revisions, low volatility, and strong free cash flow. Strong, countertrend rallies may look tempting, but the inability of key leading economic indicators to turn higher warrants a healthy dose of patience and prudence.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The Chinese are said to have invented the yo-yo over 2,500 years ago and this year, China\\'s economy and stock market seem to be imitating one. The plunge in economic activity during the COVID lockdowns that took place from March through May of this year (the first provincial lockdowns since Wuhan and Hubei in January 2020) resulted in the GDP of the world\\'s second-largest economy falling by -2.6% in the second quarter. But a rebound began in June, according to government and private sector data. China\\'s stocks have also acted like a yo-yo this year with a bear market rebounding into a bull market. COVID lockdowns are still possible in the months ahead. Although they may not be as severe as in March and April, they may still act as a drag on growth. Meanwhile, fiscal and monetary stimulus could accelerate growth in the second half of the year. The continued back-and-forth of lockdown and rebound means China\\'s economy—and stock market—could remain volatile. Recession? A drop in GDP is a rare event in China. China hasn\\'t reported negative GDP growth in over 30 years, except for one quarter during the 2020 pandemic, as you can see in the chart below. We wrote about China\\'s sharp economic downturn in early May (Recession in China?) noting that \"The world\\'s second-largest economy and consumer market has likely slipped into a recession, at least by China\\'s standards.\" China reports rare negative GDP quarter Source: Charles Schwab, China National Bureau of Statistics, Macrobond data as of 7/15/2022. Rebound So far, China appears unlikely to see two quarters of back-to-back declines in GDP. The economy began to recover in May and June, mainly due to a sequential easing in COVID restrictions and more policy support amid the reopening of some large cities such as Shanghai. The easing of restrictions particularly benefitted industrial production; the manufacturing Purchasing Managers\\' Index (PMI) survey of business leaders jumped back above the 50 level in June, the strongest reading in over a year, as shown in the chart below. Specifically, growth in automobile production surged to +26.8% year-over-year in June from -4.8% in May as auto supply chains continued to improve after Shanghai\\'s reopening. China\\'s manufacturing PMI has rebounded Source: Charles Schwab, S&P Global, Bloomberg data as of 7/15/2022. A PMI reading above 50 represents economic expansion and a PMI reading below 50 represents economic contraction, and a reading at 50 indicates no change. Outside of manufacturing, other signs of rebounding growth in June emerged: Retail sales growth jumped to a stronger-than-expected +3.1% year-over-year pace in June from -6.7% in May. COVID-sensitive catering sales growth improved to -4.0% from -21.1%. Business fixed asset investment growth increased to +5.9% year-over-year in June from +4.7% in May, thanks to more policy support. Unemployment rates declined modestly in June, suggesting labor market pressure has eased slightly. June borrowing, a sign of confidence and future growth, came in above expectations. The rapid credit growth in June likely reflected a combination of strong fiscal policy support (record-high single-month government bond issuance), further easing in credit supply (the People\\'s Bank of China urged banks to accelerate loan extensions) and easing COVID restrictions lifting activity. Yo-yo The economic yo-yo could continue. The worst of China\\'s COVID lockdowns may be in the rear view as the government seeks to reduce the negative economic and social impact going forward. COVID rules were clarified to give local governments less ability to abuse them and quarantines were cut in half. Even still, zero-COVID policies could continue to constrict activity in 2022 should new COVID waves develop, and the government is likely to move cautiously ahead of President Xi\\'s next term. At the same time, fiscal and monetary stimulus in China is likely to continue feeding growth in the second half of the year heading into the Party Congress. China\\'s COVID waves Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 7/15/2022. Bull market What may be the only bull market in the world right now is taking place in China. The MSCI China Index has risen over 20% from its low on March 15, even as other stock markets, including the S&P 500 Index, have continued to decline. China\\'s bull market over past four months: March 15 to July 15 Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 7/15/2022. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses (or \"transaction fees or other related expenses\"), and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. While the lockdowns of March through May weighed only modestly on the performance of China\\'s stocks, additional lockdowns amidst a more rapidly slowing global economy and tightening monetary policy in western nations may have a greater impact in the future. While any easing of trade relations between China and western nations may aid China\\'s stock market, tougher trade and capital policies being discussed in Washington and any breakdown of discussions over audit transparency of Chinese companies traded in the U.S. could hurt. What happens in China doesn\\'t stay in China, due to China\\'s large economy and influence on global trade. That said, the disruptions to supply chains during the second quarter were smaller in size relative to 2021, as inventory levels for many goods have caught up and demand shifted toward services. If China comes to embrace living with COVID rather than continuing lockdowns, it could give a boost to confidence in continued global growth. In the meantime, China\\'s economy and stock market may remain volatile.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My daughter has been out of work for a year, and has asked me to lend her $15,000 until she can get back on her feet. I think I\\'m in a position to spare the money now, but will definitely need to be paid back by the time I retire in three years. Can you advise me on how best to help her out but also look out for myself? —A Reader Dear Reader, This is an interesting question because it calls on you to listen to both your heart and your head. On the one hand, I can appreciate your desire to help your daughter through a rough patch because that\\'s what caring families do for each other. On the other hand, it\\'s essential that you also think through the practical implications for your own financial security. After all, the last thing you want is to become financially dependent yourself, especially as you approach retirement! Let\\'s take a look at some things to think about—and do—before you make this important decision. Carefully examine your financial situation Before you do anything else, take a long, hard look at your own finances. Do you ever struggle to pay your bills each month? Do you have an ample emergency fund and sufficient insurance coverage to assure you\\'d be able to weather a setback of your own? To be secure, I recommend you maintain enough savings to cover a minimum of three to six months\\' worth of essential expenses. In addition, make sure you have adequate health and disability insurance to cover you in case an illness or accident keeps you out of work. Think through these issues carefully before you write a check. Decide how much you can afford to lend If you\\'re convinced you\\'re in a position to loan your daughter money, do a gut check on how much you can afford. If it turns out you can only manage a smaller amount, don\\'t feel guilty. Your daughter is fortunate to receive any funds that you can safely spare. Create a formal loan document Once you\\'ve decided on an amount, it\\'s important to write up a formal loan document. Because you\\'re lending money to your daughter, you might think you can simply write a check and call it a day. Unfortunately, though, unless you have a signed written document with a fixed repayment schedule and minimum interest rate, things can get complicated with the IRS. Documentation also gives you the ability to deduct an unpaid loan on your income tax return if for any reason your daughter can\\'t pay you back. You don\\'t have to charge market rates, but you do need to set an interest rate at least equal to what the IRS refers to as the \"applicable federal rate\" (AFR). This is especially important if the loan is over $10,000. Otherwise, you could get hit with having to pay taxes on the \"imputed interest\" you never received. (The tax implications of imputed interest can be tricky; check with a tax advisor if you\\'re unsure about how to proceed.) AFR rates are quite low compared to commercial rates, which should make repayment much more doable for your daughter. As the lender, you will report any interest you receive as taxable income, and your daughter may be able to deduct interest expenses on her tax return. AFR rates are set monthly and vary on the type and term of the loan; you can find them at IRS.gov. Keep accurate records Once the loan comes due, be sure to keep accurate records of every payment. If your daughter misses a payment, it\\'s important to document that as well. If at any time you\\'re unsure of interest charges or the balance due, consult with an accountant who can help you stay organized and on top of all the necessary details. Clearly communicate your expectations And now we can get back to the personal side of things. It\\'s clear you want the best for your daughter, so if you decide to go ahead with the loan, tell her that. Explain your very real concerns for your own financial well-being so that she understands how important it is for her to pay you back in full and on time. Ask her if she has any questions or misgivings so that everything is on the table. Your daughter is fortunate to have such a supportive parent. By lending her money now, you\\'re not only helping her through a tough time, you\\'re also expressing your confidence in her ability to bounce back for a stronger future.

       "   'content': 'The June employment report was hailed as strong, but digging a little deeper reveals a mixed labor market picture. Yes, payrolls were stronger than expected at 372k vs. the consensus expectation of 268k, along with the unemployment rate remaining at 3.6%. Here are the rubs, however: There were downward revisions to the past two months\\' payrolls, totaling 75k; the household survey (from which the unemployment rate is calculated) showed a drop in employment to the tune of -315k. The chart below shows both the payrolls (blue bars) and household (orange bars) surveys; and as shown, the household survey shows that employment has fallen in two of the past three months.

The financial activities category was also notably weak, perhaps reflecting a more challenging interest rate and market environment. Private > government payrolls Source: Charles Schwab, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 6/30/2022. Another rub is tied to the unemployment rate. As noted, it remained at a very low 3.6%, as shown in the first chart below. However, that was for the \"wrong\" reason as the labor force participation rate (LFPR) has rolled over—both overall and prime age measures—as shown in the second chart below. Unemployment rate = lagging indicator Source: Charles Schwab, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 6/30/2022. Troubling rollover in LFPR Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 6/30/2022. Jobs report answers recession question? Throughout the course of the day on Friday, we read many a headline suggesting that still-strong payrolls and a still-low unemployment rate made a mockery of the recession view that has become more pervasive. Keep in mind that payrolls are a coincident indicator, representing one of the four components of The Conference Board\\'s Coincident Economic Index (CEI), which are also the primary data points analyzed by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) when it declares/dates recessions (the other three are wholesale/retail trade sales, industrial production, and personal income). The trend in payrolls is unquestionably lower: the latest three-month average of payrolls is 375k vs. the six-month average of 457k and the 12-month average of 524k (last year\\'s average was 562k). The unemployment rate, on the other hand, is a lagging indicator. A simple look at the unemployment rate chart above shows that the unemployment rate has always been low at the onset of recessions—and always high, and typically still rising at the end of recessions. As for coincident payrolls, it\\'s important to understand that at the start of the 2020, 2007, 1981, 1980, 1974, and 1960 recessions, payrolls were still strong and/or at/near their peak. Tune into the July Market Snapshot video later this week for more on the history of the relationship between payrolls and recessions. As an aside, we continue to believe a recession is more likely than a soft landing, and that the recession may have already begun. However, given the bear market in stocks is already well underway, the semantics of a recession matters less than it would have back at the market\\'s high at the start of this year. What we do know is that gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in the first quarter, while the Atlanta Fed\\'s GDPNow tracker pegs the second quarter in negative territory. Two consecutive quarters of negative GDP is not the definition of recession; but it unequivocally shows weak growth, about which there is little dispute. Nominal wages up; real wages way down Reported along with the jobs report was average hourly earnings (AHE), which were up 0.3% month/month and 5.1% year/year, in line with consensus estimates. However, both were down from the prior month\\'s 0.4% and 5.3%, respectively. Because AHE is a simple average and can get skewed by wage mix shifts, we often focus instead on median measures, including the Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker. Shown below, not only has nominal wage growth (blue line) started to slow, the four-decade high in inflation is taking its toll; hence, real wage growth (orange line) has moved firmly into negative territory. Wages pressured by inflation Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, as of 5/31/2022. Atlanta Fed\\'s Wage Growth Tracker is a measure of the nominal wage growth of individuals. *Real adjusted with CPI year/year inflation. Focus on leading indicators As noted, the payroll survey is a coincident indicator, and the unemployment rate is a lagging indicator. Of the major labor market data regularly released, the weekly report on unemployment claims is a leading economic indicator. In fact, it is one of the 10 components of The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI). Economists often look at the four-week rolling average of weekly claims (it smooths out the often-volatile weekly movements). As shown below, they are up from their lows earlier in the year. A quick glance at the chart suggests a \"nothing to see here\" attitude is warranted; however, as shown in the table, they\\'re up more than 36% from their April low, which is above the historical average heading into recessions. Claims have turned higher Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Department of Labor, as of 7/1/2022. Y-axis truncated for visual purposes. We can also look at the indicators that lead the leading indicators. Job openings are often compared to the number of unemployed, and as shown below, the spread remains historically wide. However, job openings have begun to roll over—and they lag, with the latest reading only through May. It\\'s also important to understand that job openings arguably overstate the number of actual individual openings. One of the criteria for a job opening is that there is \"active recruiting\" for workers outside the establishment with the posted opening. That may include advertising, posting internet notices, posting signs, making word-of-mouth \"announcements,\" contacting employment agencies, or setting up at a job fair or similar source of possible applicants. Openings rolling over Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unemployed persons as of 6/30/2022 and JOLTS as of 5/31/2022. In addition, the pool of labor available for those jobs spans beyond just those who are unemployed. Potential job switchers, included in the number of people employed, should also be considered as potentially competing for those job openings. On top of that, the survey used to calculate job openings is entirely different from the survey associated with the number of people unemployed (with the latter having a much longer history). All of this suggests that the labor market may be less tight than conventionally believed, detailed by the St. Louis Fed in a recent article. Confirming the rolling over in job openings is more timely weekly data from Indeed, shown below. Indeed (pun intended), new job postings are still up 60% relative to pre-pandemic levels, but that\\'s down from this past February\\'s high of nearly 90%; i.e., the trend is deteriorating and bears watching. New job postings rolling over Source: Charles Schwab, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (fred.stlouisfed.org), as of 7/1/2022. New postings are postings on Indeed for 7 days or fewer. Often concurrent with waning job openings is an uptick in layoff announcements. The left chart below shows the Challenger measure of job-cut announcements back to the start of 2007. The right chart is a close-up look at the trend over the past year. There has been a clear move up, with the latest reading (as of the end of June) up 60% year/year. Second-quarter earnings season, which gets underway this week, could add more color to this story if companies disclose their labor plans looking forward. Layoff announcements surging Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 6/30/2022. In sum The \"labor market is very tight\" story may be in its natural final chapters, notwithstanding the decent June jobs report. As we often tell investors, \"better or worse matters more than good or bad\" when it comes to both the timing of economic inflection points and the relationship between economic data and stock market behavior. Levels remain healthy among most labor market data; but it\\'s the deterioration in the trends that bears watching to declare the winner of the recession vs. soft-landing debate.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'It\\'s fair to say that earlier this year, central bankers were struggling to communicate their intentions clearly to the markets. However, that doesn\\'t appear to be the case any longer. In the United States, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the members of the Federal Reserve\\'s policy-making Open Market Committee (FOMC) have been steadfast in signaling their commitment to fighting inflation. If there is a communication problem, it\\'s mostly that central bankers don\\'t want to admit out loud that getting inflation down raises the risk of recession. European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde is facing an even more difficult problem. The ECB wants to raise rates due to rising inflation stemming from the spike in energy prices. However, the data suggest that Europe\\'s economy is weakening—largely due to the rise in energy prices. Meanwhile the ECB also wants to limit the widening in bond spreads between core and peripheral countries as markets focus on recession risks in countries with high debt levels. Talk about a policy dilemma. Not to be left out, Bank of Japan (BOJ) President Haruhiko Kuroda has had to apologize repeatedly over the past few weeks for saying that Japanese consumers don\\'t mind rising inflation stemming from the yen\\'s steep drop. The problem is that the BOJ is trying to have it all ways. It wants to maintain its zero-interest-rate policy and yield-curve control, while also preventing the yen from falling to a new multi-decade low. Not surprisingly, markets have been roiled by these confusing and sometimes circular arguments coming from central bankers. But in my view, the bond market has it figured out. Since the Fed\\'s last meeting, Treasury yields have fallen across all maturities. In fact, short-term yields peaked on the first day of the Fed\\'s last meeting, when the federal funds rate was raised by 75 basis points (or three-quarters of a percentage point). The yield curve has flattened since the last FOMC meeting Source: Bloomberg, data as of 6/14/2022 and 6/30/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. It looks like the Fed\\'s actions and pledge to bring inflation down have resonated with the market. If the Fed follows through in hiking rates as much as the recent projections indicate, the risk of recession rises. Consequently, bond yields have been pulling back from recent highs and the yield curve has flattened. Bloomberg Financial Conditions Index Source: Bloomberg.

The case for lower bond yields in the second half of the year Economic growth is slowing Gross domestic product (GDP) growth contracted in the first quarter, driven primarily by a drop in consumption. Since consumer spending comprises about 70% of GDP growth, a slowdown in spending is concerning. Early indications point to a risk that Q2 GDP growth was also likely weak. Two negative quarters of GDP growth isn\\'t the official definition of recession, but it signals that the indicators are pointing in that direction. In addition to weaker consumer spending, housing and manufacturing activity have slowed in recent months. Notably, the softening in demand is coinciding with increasing supply. Housing inventories are increasing, and houses are sitting on the market longer as affordability drops. Purchasing manager index (PMI) data points to slowing momentum in both manufacturing and services. PMI for both manufacturing and services activity has softened Source: Bloomberg. U.S. Manufacturing PMI SA (MPMIUSMA Index) and U.S. Services PMI Business Activity SA (MPMIUSSA Index). Monthly data as of 6/30/2022.

The labor market, which is a lagging indicator for the economy, is also showing signs that hiring momentum is slipping. Initial jobless claims have been rising since the second quarter, and the four-week moving average reached its highest level since January. Despite the repeated concern expressed by Fed officials that the labor market is strong—even \"too strong\"—the high-frequency data suggest it is softening.

Weekly Initial Jobless Claims (INJCJC Index) and Continuing Claims (INJCSP Index). Data as of 6/30/2022. Inflation expectations have declined One reason the Fed has given for an aggressive pace of tightening is the fear that inflation expectations will become \"unanchored\" and therefore self-fulfilling. If consumers and businesses believe prices will be higher in the future, they may pull forward consumption and drive demand even higher relative to supply. Moreover, workers may demand higher wages to keep up with inflation, causing a \"wage-price spiral.\" It was the reason cited by Powell for the 75-basis-point rate hike at the last FOMC meeting. However, market-based readings of inflation expectations peaked at just over 3% in April and have fallen back since then. The implied 10-year average inflation derived from the TIPS market fell to as low as 2.3% in early July (July 5, 2022) despite current inflation of more than 8%. It\\'s estimated that the Fed\\'s \"comfort zone\" is for inflation expectations in the 2.0% to 2.5% range. Inflation expectations discounted in TIPS market have fallen Source: Bloomberg. U.S. Breakeven 10 Year (USGGBE10 Index). Daily data as of 6/30/2022. Falling commodity prices Over the past few months, prices in many commodity groups have dropped—from copper and other industrial metals to grains and even oil. After a surge in prices as the global economy emerged from the pandemic, prices have begun to drop back, signaling slower goods inflation going forward. Copper prices have declined Source: Bloomberg. Copper Future Sep22 (HGU2 Comdty). Daily data as of 6/30/2022. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Since much of the increase in inflation over the last year can be attributed to the shortage of the supply of goods relative to demand, the recent drop in prices suggests less inflation in the pipeline. Quantitative tightening will drain liquidity from the financial system It hasn\\'t been front and center in the news lately, but the Fed has begun to allow its balance sheet to decline. This will contribute to the tightening in financial conditions. As the Fed allows bonds to mature and \"roll off\" its balance sheet, it tends to shrink the amount of money available in the financial system. As a result, the monetary base—the total amount of money in circulation—declines. In that way, a declining balance sheet has the same effect as rate increases. Economists estimate that quantitative tightening (QT) probably will be equivalent to 100 basis points1 in tightening or more, depending on how far it extends. Recently, the growth rate in money supply has begun dropping sharply after rising sharply from the pandemic lows. The current year/year growth rate in M2 money supply2 is 6.6%, near the average of the 2014-2019 period. In real terms—that is, adjusted for inflation—money supply growth is negative—consistent with tight monetary policy. Real money supply growth is negative Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

M2 is closely watched as an indicator of money supply and future inflation, and as a target of central bank monetary policy. Real M2 Money Stock Series deflates M2 money stock with CPI. How low can they go? With headline inflation still high, it may be hard for bond yields to fall much below 2.75% in the near term. However, it also appears that the 3.5% level reached in June could mark the high for the year. If recent economic trends continue, it would not be surprising to see 10-year Treasury yields fall further in the second half of the year, perhaps as low as 2.5%. That may prompt the Fed to slow its pace of rate hikes and/or alter its tightening plan later in the year. However, it may seem counterintuitive, but the more the Fed \"front loads\" its rate hikes and runs the risk of triggering a recession, the lower bond yields can fall. We suggest investors looking to add more yield to their portfolios consider adding more duration—exposure to interest rate risk—to their portfolios with bonds that have low credit risk, such as Treasuries and investment-grade corporate and municipal bonds. A bond ladder strategy can be an effective way to average into the market. 10-year Treasury yields may have peaked in June Source: Bloomberg. U.S. Generic 10-year Treasury Yield (USGG10YR INDEX).

After a year of supply shortages, we may be closer to the end of the supply chain problems than the beginning.

Manufacturers The inventory buildup can be seen well beyond these specific industries. The inventory levels of finished goods at manufacturers around the world have soared. The latest June reading for the Eurozone Purchasing Managers\\' Index (PMI) of finished goods inventories rose to 51.5 from 42.3 a year ago, surging to multi-decade highs only surpassed by the excess inventory buildup that took place during the pandemic recession of 2020.

Near-record inventory buildup Source: Charles Schwab, S&P Global, Bloomberg data as of 6/30/2022. The building inventory glut highlights a key risk to upcoming second quarter earnings reports. As reports begin in a couple of weeks, investors may not welcome any news of excess inventories, if the stock price performance of the retailers that have already reported their latest quarterly results is any indication. Retailers tend to report on an off-calendar quarter basis, giving us a preview of market sentiment surrounding excess inventory levels. Inflation A potential positive outcome is that companies could cut prices to reduce unwanted inventory, easing inflation for goods. Inflation peaks tend to follow a process, rather than all prices peaking at one point in time. History has shown that energy and goods prices almost always peak before services prices (which makes up the largest inflation category and includes both housing and medical care). In the U.S. and Japan, the two countries with consistent inflation data going back more than 50 years, commodities and goods inflation tended to peak two to four months before services inflation. Inflation peaks tend to be a process Source: Charles Schwab, Bureau of Economic Analysis data as of 6/30/2022. U.S. CPI breakdown by category and typical pattern of peaks shown for illustrative purposes. Energy - The global benchmark for crude oil, Brent, has fallen about $10 a barrel in June and a broad mix of 13 metal commodities, including copper and steel, that make up the Commodity Research Bureau\\'s Metals Index have plunged below the level of a year ago. This suggests we may be passing the peak in commodity prices. Goods - With signs of retailers and manufacturers suddenly burdened with excess goods inventory, it\\'s too early to be sure we\\'ve seen goods prices peak—but it is possible. Last week\\'s inflation readings came in a little softer than expected, reflecting the first monthly drop in prices for goods. Thursday\\'s PCE deflator in the U.S., Wednesday\\'s CPI for Germany and Friday\\'s CPI for Tokyo, Japan, were all down from last month and weaker than expected— although still quite high. The data may be suggesting that goods inflation may finally be peaking around the world. Services - Even if we are seeing a peak in commodity and goods inflation, services inflation may not show signs of a peak for several months. Services inflation tends to react both more slowly than energy/goods and less dramatically. A key ingredient for markets to form a bottom is a clear sign that inflation has peaked. As bad as the news on the inventory gluts has been for the stocks of the companies experiencing them, it may end up being good news for investors in the broader market if it leads to receding inflation pressures that lessen central banks\\' aggressive actions to curb demand.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My husband died recently and I\\'m now on my own at age 78. I\\'m not used to dealing with things like Medicare and Social Security. Where can I go for help if I have issues? —A Reader Dear Reader, When you experience the death of a loved one, everything else pales in significance. But as your question implies, you still need to deal with the practical and financial issues in life, which can be a lot more difficult when facing them alone. At this time, it\\'s really important to reach out to trusted friends, family and advisors. Don\\'t be afraid to ask for help—and don\\'t let yourself become isolated. There are also community services available if you know where to look for them. At the same time, be aware that older adults in your situation are often the target of financial fraudsters who see you as particularly vulnerable. Don\\'t be fearful, just be cautious. Here are some resources to help you get started. Applying for Social Security survivors\\' benefits As a widow or widower, you qualify for 100% of your husband\\'s benefits at what the Social Security Administration (SSA) considers your \"full retirement age.\" For those born between 1943 and 1954, your FRA is 66. (FRA gradually increases by a few months for every birth year, until it reaches 67 for people born in 1960 and later.) For the record, younger spouses can file for Social Security survivor benefits as early as age 60 (or age 50 if they have a disability), but their benefit will be reduced. If you have your own work record, you would effectively keep the \"higher\" of your Social Security benefit or your spouse\\'s Social Security benefit, but not both. The SSA can give you detailed information on what you need to provide to get your husband\\'s benefits (e.g., a death certificate, your marriage certificate, and Social Security numbers for both of you) and will work with you to assure you receive the maximum you\\'re entitled to including a lump-sum death payment of $255. You can find specifics on how to apply at ssa.gov. However you can\\'t apply for survivors benefits online. You must either call 1-800-772-1213 or contact your local Social Security office. Contacting Medicare Generally, you\\'re eligible for Medicare if you or your husband worked for at least 10 years in Medicare-covered employment, you\\'re 65 or older and a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. If you have questions, there are two primary sources of information: If you\\'re already enrolled in Medicare, your benefits should remain the same. However, if you haven\\'t yet enrolled, have questions about eligibility or you want to apply for the Extra Help benefit available under the prescription drug program, you should contact the Social Security Administration either online at ssa.gov or at the same phone number listed above: 1-800-772-1213. For questions about covered medical services, Medicare part D drug plans, choosing between Original Medicare or Medicare Advantage, or finding a local doctor or hospital that accepts Medicare patients, contact the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (1-800-633-4227 or medicare.gov). Finding someone to help you Dealing with these issues—especially at a time like this—can seem a bit overwhelming. Fortunately, there are organizations that can help you. One good place to start could be the Area Agencies on Aging. These agencies are dedicated to helping older adults get assistance with healthcare, homecare, transportation and more. Many offer specific help with Medicare and Medicaid issues and provide volunteer counselors and community education programs. To find out what\\'s offered in your community, you can go to n4a.org or eldercare.acl.gov, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. Either website will take you to the Eldercare Locator that can direct you to specific programs in your area. You can also call 1-800-677-1116. There are a number of other websites dedicated to issues for older Americans such as the National Council on Aging and the Medicare Rights Center that provide online tools for finding local resources and support services, as well as information on government health and disability programs, legal resources and more. Speaking of legal services, another option is to find an attorney who specializes in older adult issues and understands how to navigate through the maze of government agencies. This may be more costly—and you want to make sure you get an attorney who is highly recommended. An attorney can also help you review and update your estate planning documents including wills, powers of attorney, medical directives and trust documents. The National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys has an online locator that can provide a starting point for finding a qualified attorney in your area. Moving forward with your financial life I know it\\'s not easy, but it\\'s very important that you now take a close look at your new financial reality. You don\\'t have to do it alone. Discuss your situation, concerns and goals with your family or look for a financial advisor if you don\\'t already have one. Talk about how your lifestyle may change. Go over your saving and spending, and assess your current situation and future needs. The key is to stay active and involved, reach out, and as much as possible act as your own advocate. By doing so, you may find a more powerful support system than you imagined—one that can help you move forward with confidence. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': \"It is difficult to find a market that has captured the zeitgeist of the pandemic, inflationary rebound, and attendant affordability crisis better than the housing sector. While home sales initially collapsed under the weight of the global economic shutdown, they rebounded at an incredibly sharp rate for a host of reasons—not least being the desire for individuals to look for more space, accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, and consumers' lack of ability to spend on services during the depths of the shutdown phase. Bust, boom, bust What started as a rebound has turned into an acute affordability crisis for an increasing number of buyers. Suppressed inventories, bidding wars, and hotter demand created a perfect storm for surging home sales and prices. After falling by nearly 28% during the pandemic-induced recession in early 2020, existing home sales spiked by 63% in just eight months, as shown in the chart below. New home sales experienced a shallower drop during the recession but surged by 78% in just four months off the pandemic low. The boom seems to be over for now, as existing and new home sales have rolled over considerably from their peaks by 19% and 33%, respectively. For what it's worth, declines of both magnitudes from 2005-2007 preceded the broader economy's drop into recession; though, as we'll explain later in this report, the prospects of a housing crisis akin to the mid-2000s are low. Not much wind in the sales Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, National Association of Realtors, U.S. Census Bureau, as of 5/31/2022. Unsurprisingly, the sharp rebound in home sales coincided with a surge in home prices. As shown below, both existing and new home prices have increased at double-digit annual rates (six-month averages are shown for smoothing purposes) beyond what we saw during the lead-in to the housing crisis more than a decade ago. We like to remind investors that, as it pertains to economic data, rate of change is key whenever analyzing trend shifts. Further, the change in the rate of change helps identify key inflection points. As such, with the peak in home price growth likely behind us, the trend is moving in the right direction for buyers. However, existing home price growth has stabilized of late, maintaining a double-digit average growth rate above 15%. That cannot last in perpetuity, but as the increase in prices stays near the stratosphere, demand may fall at a faster pace. Higher highs in price growth Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, National Association of Realtors, U.S. Census Bureau, as of 5/31/2022. Historic price growth has left many consumers asking how we got here. As with all markets, it often boils down to a supply-demand imbalance. In the aftermath of the housing market's collapse during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), builders reduced the pace of home construction by a significant degree, leaving housing supply relatively low. As shown below, monthly supply for existing homes (the number of months it would take to sell all homes on the market at the current sales pace) has been in a chronic downtrend since the GFC, while new home supply has moved up marginally (though it's a smaller share of the overall market). A split supply recovery Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, National Association of Realtors, U.S. Census Bureau, as of 5/31/2022. Relatively suppressed supply was never a major issue until the pandemic unleashed a massive home demand shock on the upside. That said, there were hints of a brewing imbalance in the lead-in to the pandemic, given the U.S. homeownership rate troughed in 2016 and has since been increasing. A solid driver of that was the demographic push, as millennials' aging and increase in buying power propelled them to buy homes. The spike higher was accelerated by the pandemic, as shown below; though it has largely reversed, the longer-term uptrend hasn't been broken. No vacancy Source: Charles Schwab, U.S. Census Bureau, of 3/31/2022. While an increase in homeownership has been a welcome development, the renters' vacancy rate has continued to plunge, underscoring another crisis: would-be buyers have piled into the rental market, putting further pressure on supply and driving prices higher. When looking at the dispersion in home sales by price growth, this isn't too surprising, but remains worrisome. As shown below, the number of new homes sold for $150k-$200k has evaporated, while sales have decisively favored those selling for more than $500k. (Un)affordable housing Source: Charles Schwab, St. Louis Fed, as of 5/31/2022. The affordability crisis The lack of rental availability has put sustained, upward pressure on rent prices, which has contributed to hotter overall inflation. The owners' equivalent rent (OER) and rent of primary residence components of the consumer price index (CPI) are increasing at their fastest annual rates since 1991 and 1987, respectively. As shown below, the lead-lag relationship between home price growth (measured by the Case-Shiller Home Price Index in green) and the CPI's rent components is such that rental prices are expected to maintain their upward climb. To be sure, rents have reacted much faster to the upside in the current cycle; thus, if home price growth cools in relatively short order, it may help arrest the upward trend in rents. Yet, with current supply constraints, we don't think a fast move to the downside is imminent. Catch me if you can Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg.

With the aforementioned price and supply issues plaguing the market, it is understandable why consumers' confidence in buying homes has plummeted. As shown below, the buying conditions component of the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index has fallen to its lowest since 1982.

Back to the future Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 6/24/2022. To be or not to be the GFC The pricing pressures early in the pandemic dented consumer confidence; but in terms of actual dollars, buying power wasn't impacted drastically. In fact, it wasn't until rates started surging that affordability came under significant pressure. The chart below shows that monthly affordability—what many individuals/families depend on when it comes to housing costs—has reached its most-elevated level since 2007. Considering the conditions shown in the box within the chart, the average worker in the United States had to work nearly 47 hours to cover a monthly mortgage payment at this time last year. That figure has shot up to 66, the same level at which the housing bubble was starting to burst in 2005. This underscores the acute affordability crisis many Americans are now facing. Both prices and rates have put homeownership out of reach for a broad swath of the population, which has been exacerbated by a 40-year high in inflation and aggressive monetary policy. Multiple affordability hits Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 5/31/2022. While comparisons to the GFC abound, we take comfort in the fact that the amount of leverage tied to the housing market—be it in risky lending or securities—is nowhere near what we saw in the subprime bubble. Looking at mortgage originations alone, as shown below, lending has been decisively in favor of those with superior credit scores. In addition, housing as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen significantly since the GFC, housing supply is not raging alongside demand, and household balance sheets are in much better shape (the household sector has in fact led the charge in deleveraging since 2008). The higher score wins Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 3/31/2022. In sum Longer-term, we remain fairly optimistic on the housing supply front, but are also keenly aware that the imbalance may take quite some time to correct. As shown below, we have never seen such a wide spread between housing completions and the number of units under construction. The good news is that—from an overbuilding perspective—we are in a mirror-image scenario relative to 2005, which should dampen the potential economic ripple effects from a fallout in housing. Backlogs pile up Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, U.S. Census Bureau, as of 5/31/2022. Yet, the bad news is that housing starts have maintained their long-term upward climb as completions have lagged. That puts the housing market in an increasingly precarious scenario. Starts have eased lately, and while the coming supply of completed units will provide opportunities for prospective buyers, a decline in prices and housing-start activity may exacerbate weakness in the broader economy. With tension having built on both the supply and demand side, it's difficult to envision what the elixir for housing is. A drop in prices would be welcome for several segments of buyers, but it may be a symptom—perhaps even a cause—of a broader economic slowdown as worsening confidence and income growth hold back consumers' abilities to make large purchases. As economic growth continues to slow, the Federal Reserve hikes rates aggressively near-term, and asset markets remain weak, we continue to think the needle points to further economic weakness—elevating the chances of a recession sooner rather than later.\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, After delaying our vacation plans for more times than I can remember over the last 2 years, my husband and I are finally going to do some travelling. We\\'re both retired and on Medicare. Does Medicare cover us if we\\'re in a different state? How about if we take a cruise or travel overseas? —A Reader Dear Reader, It\\'s exciting to hear that you and so many other retirees are finally once again able to plan trips—here in the U.S. and overseas. To my mind, nothing beats opportunities to explore new places and connect with interesting people from all walks of life. At the same time, though, you\\'re wise to plan for unexpected glitches. Apart from being unpleasant and a disruption to your travel plans, an illness or accident can lead to big financial surprises and out-of-pocket costs—even if you\\'re covered by Medicare. The amount of coverage you\\'ll receive depends not only on where you go but also on the type of Medicare coverage you have—so in some cases, it can make a lot of sense to purchase additional insurance. Here\\'s what you need to know before you book your trip. When you\\'re traveling in the U.S. If you have Original Medicare, you can go to any physician or hospital that accepts Medicare patients (which most do). This coverage extends to all 50 states as well as all territories such as Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands. If you have a Medicare Advantage plan, your policy may or may not provide coverage outside its service area, so be sure to check your plan for details and costs. That said, all Medicare Advantage plans are required to cover emergency and urgent care, regardless of any restrictions on service areas. This is especially important for people who have two homes or who spend a good part of the year in a different part of the country. Be sure to check with your Medicare Advantage plan provider to understand what is \"in-network\" for both locations. This can also impact which residence should be your primary address. When you\\'re traveling overseas The most important thing to understand is that with a few exceptions, Original Medicare doesn\\'t pay for health expenses outside of the U.S. Therefore, if you have Original Medicare, you should look into purchasing a Medigap policy if you don\\'t already have one. Some (but not all) Medigap plans will cover emergency services overseas. Along with this coverage, you\\'ll likely have a $250 deductible, coverage limited to the first 60 days of your trip, a co-pay of 20%, and a lifetime limit of just $50,000. If you have a Medicare Advantage plan, you likely have some coverage for foreign travel, but there may be restrictions. Be sure to research the details of your policy so that you understand exactly what is or isn\\'t covered. For both Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans, make sure you understand your company\\'s definition of \"emergency\" vs. \"urgent\" care. A common distinction is that emergency care is required because of an injury or condition that will place your physical or mental health in serious jeopardy. Urgent care, on the other hand, covers less serious conditions and may not be covered. When you\\'re traveling in Canada If you\\'re traveling in or near Canada, there a couple of instances when you can receive emergency treatment: You\\'re in the U.S. but the closest hospital in time of emergency is in Canada. You have a medical emergency while traveling through Canada as the most direct route between Alaska and another state, and the Canadian hospital is closer than the nearest U.S. hospital. When you\\'re on a cruise If you\\'re on a cruise ship in U.S. waters or no more than six hours from a U.S. port, you will have coverage. Medicare won\\'t pay for services when the ship is further away. Look into supplemental travel insurance Given all of these restrictions on care, I advise that all international travelers look into purchasing additional insurance—but be sure to do your homework. Most travel insurance policies have set benefits that can\\'t be changed. In addition to covering things like non-refundable trip costs and trip cancellations, most will also cover emergency medical expenses. If you want more coverage for medical care, including medical transportation and evacuation, you will have to purchase a more comprehensive policy. Before you sign up, be sure you understand all of the covered risks, exclusions and reimbursement policies. The cheapest policy is often not the best way to go. A few extras before you start packing In addition to making sure you have adequate coverage for your travels, experts recommend that you carry the following documents: Covid-19 vaccination card. At this point in the pandemic, this may seem obvious, but make sure you can easily access your vaccination status—whether it\\'s in paper or digital form. Proof of other vaccinations. Depending on where you\\'re travelling, you may also need to show documentation for other vaccines. Check the CDC website for recommended vaccinations by country. Covid-19 test result. Again, depending on your destination, you may be asked to show proof of a recent negative test. List of your medications and copies of your prescriptions. It\\'s always a good idea to carry extra medication, but also have handy a digital or paper copy of all prescriptions. List of your allergies. Especially if you have a potentially life-threatening allergy, be sure to have this information handy in case of emergency. Health insurance information. You don\\'t need to carry your complete policies, but do have handy your policy numbers and contact information. You may also want to have a summary of additional coverage from a travel policy. If all of this sounds like a lot, I suppose it is. But to my mind, once you\\'re fully prepared, you\\'ll be that much better able to take in all the wonderful and exciting aspects of travel.

       "   'abstract': 'Investors often notice the overall direction of markets; missed changes in asset classes under the surface could see a shark attack take a big bite out of unprepared portfolios.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Summer trips to the beach may bring to mind sandy beaches, ocean waves, and the risk of shark attacks. Sharks can be found across the globe, from sub-polar to tropical regions and from shallow waters to deep open oceans. But shark attacks aren't limited to the oceans; we can find them in the stock markets too. A major shark attack is underway that could take a big bite out of unprepared investors' portfolios. Those who haven't rebalanced, trimming what had been outperforming and buying what had been lagging, could be especially at risk. Recessions and bear markets, followed by recoveries, happen at the turning points of every economic cycle. The leaders of the last cycle tend to reverse and fall the most in the bear market while the recovery and next cycle tend to see new leaders. Therefore, the looming risk of recession can make it a good time to rebalance from U.S. to International and Growth to Value. U.S. and international The chart below shows what stock market shark attacks look like using the relative performance of U.S. and international stock indexes. The lines are just the ratio of one index divided by the other. When the blue line is rising, international stocks are outperforming U.S. stocks. When the orange line is rising, U.S. stocks are outperforming international stocks. They are mirror images of each other. Shark attack: U.S. versus international Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 6/13/2022. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. There were numerous baby shark attacks around recessions in the 1970s and 2000s. But, in the late 1980s, the jaws were gaping wide after about a decade of international stock market outperformance. As U.S. stocks began to outperform, the enormous jaws began to close and likely took a big bite out of the portfolio of investors who hadn't rebalanced away from international stocks. Now, the shark's massive jaws are open wide again, having been extending for more than 10 years. This time markets appear to be prepared to take a bite out of the relative performance of the U.S. stock market. We could see another a shark attack as international stocks begin to outperform. Readers may recall that we wrote about how to prepare to avoid this shark attack a couple of years ago. We thought the 2020 recession would start the shark attack, as recessions had generally marked the start of changes in relative performance as the jaws slammed shut in the past. But the 2020 recession was too brief and saw too much stimulus further inflating U.S. growth stocks. Now, the likely coming recession may finally bring the change in leadership as the Federal Reserve and other central banks drain the ocean of liquidity that had been floating U.S. growth stocks ever higher. No one knows for sure if we have seen the peak of U.S. stock market outperformance of international stocks; the shark jaws could open still wider after appearing to begin to bite down so far this year as international stocks outperformed. But the risk of a shark attack is pretty high. Prepared investors should be thinking about the turning tide and rebalancing their portfolios from the U.S. to international stocks back to their long-term allocations after more than a decade of U.S. outperformance. Growth and value Another shark attack could result from the wide gap between the performance of the equity investing styles of growth and value, as you can see in the chart below. Shark attack: Growth versus value Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 6/13/2022. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. Growth stocks sharply outperformed value in the late 1990s, led by the Information Technology sector. Then as Tech stocks crashed, value stocks began to outperform from 2000 to 2007 and the jaws again widened, led by the Financials sector. As the Global Financial Crisis erupted in 2008, stocks returned to growth leadership, again led by the Tech sector. While the jaws have already begun to bite down, it may not be too late to rebalance from growth to value. Growth and value are two fundamental approaches, or styles, in stock investing. Growth stocks tend to offer strong earnings growth while value stocks appear to be undervalued by the market. There are many ways to define value stocks rather than merely the index definitions, we have favored low price-to-cash flow stocks (short duration) as an important value factor this year. Turning the tide International and value stocks are not immune to losses in a bear market, but they may fare better. For example, the MSCI World Value Index is down 12% this year through June 15, but the MSCI World Growth Index is down a much deeper 29%. Even more importantly, as the tide reverses, international and value may be better positioned to perform in the cycle that will follow since these shifts in market leadership tend to last for years. Investors often pay a lot of attention to the direction of the overall market and may miss changes in asset class trends under the surface that shape how their diversified portfolio performs. A disciplined approach to rebalancing is important to achieving long-term investment goals. The jaws still appear to be biting down on U.S. and growth stocks—it may be time to swim toward international and value as the tide turns. There's no need to be afraid of the water, just avoid the shark attacks.

       "   'abstract': 'Economic uncertainty may have peaked in the first half of 2022, but it remains high. Stocks are likely to continue to feel the weight of Federal Reserve policy tightening, shrinking market liquidity and slower economic growth.',\n",
       "   'content': 'The U.S. economy and stock market struggled in the first half of 2022. Facing a multi-decade high in inflation, aggressive monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve, and the effects of the Russia/Ukraine war, the S&P 500® index was down 21.3% as of June 13th. Sharp, countertrend rallies may continue this year, but aggressive Fed policy, the turning of the liquidity tide, and slower economic growth likely will keep pressure on stocks. Beginning with the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the U.S. economy and asset markets greatly benefited from the epic jolt of trillions of dollars\\' worth of liquidity doled out by the Federal Reserve and Congress. With that liquidity now drying up—the Fed began raising short-term interest rates in the first half of this year—many wonder whether a recession is likely. History\\'s lessons about the impact of Fed rate-hike cycles suggest a recession is more likely than a soft landing. Although the S&P 500 index reached bear market territory (that is, a drop of 20% or more from a recent peak) in mid-June, many of its underlying stocks had been in bear markets for a while, as had the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 indexes. Short, sharp rallies within an underlying downward trend are typical of bear markets, so investors should be prepared for more volatility. Weakening earnings and profit-margin outlooks could prompt another leg down for the market. In the meantime, this is not a market likely to reward excessive risk-taking, and we continue to emphasize the importance of diversification (across and within asset classes) as well as the power of periodic rebalancing (that is, trimming investments that have grown beyond your target allocation and buying more of investments that have become underrepresented). We also suggest that stock-picking-oriented investors focus more on factors—particularly quality-oriented factors—than on sectors or traditional style indexes. Given high inflation, rising short-term interest rates, and weakening growth outlooks, we believe stocks of companies reflecting certain factors will perform better in relative terms; these include strong free cash flow, healthy balance sheets (cash rich, low debt), positive earnings revisions, and low volatility. Lastly, when markets become more volatile and weakness takes over from strength, we always remind investors that panic is not an investing strategy. Fixed income: Fed hikes rates Returns should be better for fixed income investors in the second half of 2022, now that interest rates have reset higher. However, we still expect volatility to remain high as central banks shift away from easy-money policies. Heading into the year, we forecast rising interest rates and increased volatility, which proved to be accurate. However, we didn\\'t expect it to happen as rapidly as it did. We thought it would likely be a more gradual process. But the war in Ukraine sent energy prices spiking, and supply-chain problems were more prolonged than expected, causing inflation to spike sharply higher. The resulting message from the Fed was loud and clear: It will tighten policy \"expeditiously\" until inflation comes down. We translate that to mean the upper bound of the federal funds target rate will reach 3% or more by the end of 2022. After that, it\\'s likely that the pace of rate hikes will slow, as tightening financial conditions should lead to a slower economy and lower inflation. The market is pricing in a fed funds rate of as high as 3.8% by 2023. We think that may be too high to be sustained given the economic challenges facing the global economy. In the second half of the year, we look for the yield curve1 to flatten further as the Fed hikes short-term rates, and for volatility to remain high. However, we believe the bulk of the increase in yields is likely behind us for this cycle and now favor adding duration exposure,2 while continuing to focus on higher-credit-quality bonds. As with any tightening cycle, the risk of recession is rising. Based on past tightening cycles, the chances of the Fed achieving a \"soft landing\" for the economy are not great. In recent history, there have been only two tightening cycles (1994 and 1984) that avoided a decline into recession. Even with the rising risk of recession, it\\'s worth noting that each one is unique. The current environment seems most similar to the early 1980s. Inflation was high in large part due to oil price spikes. In response, the Fed raised nominal and real interest rates aggressively. The economy was otherwise relatively healthy, with a solid banking system and consumers who weren\\'t overextended on debt. Nonetheless, there were two steep back-to-back recessions during that time period, from January to June 1980, and from July 1981 to November 1982. Housing and manufacturing experienced sharp declines and the unemployment rate soared to double-digit levels. While the Fed is determined to push inflation lower, there\\'s a good chance it won\\'t have to go to the extremes of the early 1980s. Demographic trends are far different with the U.S. population aging. That tends to result in slower growth and inflation. Another key difference in policy this time around is the use of \"forward guidance\" by the Fed. In the 1980s the Fed provided very little information about its plans to the markets. Consequently, rate hikes often surprised investors, consumers, and businesses—increasing volatility. This time around the markets should be able to anticipate changes, mitigating some of the surprise factor that can create added volatility. Global stocks and economy: Uncertainty is high Economic uncertainty may have peaked in the first half of 2022 but could still contribute to volatility and affect market performance for the remainder of the year. Stocks around the world slumped during the first half of this year as economic uncertainty surged with the war in Europe, a lockdown-induced recession in Asia\\'s biggest economy, stubbornly high inflation, and several major central banks pursuing the most aggressive series of policy rate increases in decades. Only the more commodity-driven markets of Canada, Australia, and the U.K. fared noticeably better than others, when measured in U.S. dollars. We have been recommending strategic weights across asset classes and sectors this year, not because we don\\'t have any ideas but because diversification itself is an especially good idea right now in the current period of heightened volatility. The correlation across stock markets has fallen to among the lowest levels in 20 years and portfolios benefit from diversification as sectors and markets move more independently of each other. Historically, when long-term inflation expectations are rising, it has led international stocks to outperform U.S. stocks. International markets tend to be more inflation-sensitive, with more companies that benefit from higher inflation than those that suffer. While there can be no guarantees, international stocks have been outperforming in recent months. Shorter-duration stocks can help manage the risk of rising rates. In other words, stocks with more immediate cash flows, rather than cash flows in the distant future, tended to outperform after rates bottomed in 2020, and are more dominant in international markets. Economic uncertainty may have peaked in the first half of 2022, but it remains high. Having a well-balanced, diversified portfolio, with a risk profile consistent with your goals, and being prepared with a plan in the event of an unexpected outcome are keys to successful investing. 1 A yield curve is a line that plots yields (interest rates) of bonds having equal credit quality but differing maturity dates. The slope of the yield curve gives an idea of future interest rate changes and economic activity. 2 Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a bond to a change in interest rates. Some people confuse a bond\\'s duration with its term, or time to maturity. However, term is a linear measure of the years until repayment of principal is due; it does not change with the interest rate environment. Duration, on the other hand, is non-linear and accelerates as the time to maturity lessens.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Performance underneath the surface is sometimes markedly different from the action at the Growth and Value index level.',\n",
       "   'content': 'There are often several narratives on which debates in the stock market are centered: cyclical vs. defensive; small caps vs. large caps; U.S. vs. non-U.S.; developed vs. emerging markets. One of the oldest is that of growth vs. value. Investors often ask us why our tactical recommendations don\\'t include growth and value, the way they do large- and small-capitalization stocks. The simple answer—which we\\'ll discuss more below—is that there are often major differences when it comes to the indexes associated with Growth and Value (uppercase G and V) and the factors/characteristics of growth and value (lowercase g and v), such as stronger long-term earnings growth and high free cash flow yield, respectively. The main benchmark indexes that track the performance of Growth and Value come from S&P Dow Jones Indices and FTSE Russell. Both the S&P 500® and the Russell 1000® indexes are large-cap, while the Russell 2000® indexes are small-cap. For the purposes of this report, we\\'ll focus on S&P 500 Growth, S&P 500 Value, Russell 1000 Growth, Russell 1000 Value, Russell 2000 Growth, and Russell 2000 Value indexes. Starting with the Russell family of indexes, you can see in the chart below that performance has looked markedly different when comparing large caps vs. small caps. Whereas Russell 1000 Growth has outperformed Russell 1000 Value by nearly 3,000% since the indexes\\' inception in the late 1970s, Russell 2000 Growth has lagged Russell 2000 Value by 2,000% over the same timeframe. A growth-eat-value and value-eat-growth world Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 7/31/2022. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. In keeping with the theme of large caps\\' dominance, you can see in the next chart that S&P 500 Growth has outperformed S&P 500 Value by nearly 500% since 1995 (the inception of the latter index)—a decline from the peak of more than 700% but still a strong spread over the long term. Large-cap growth reigns supreme Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 7/31/2022. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. As is the case with Growth vs. Value in general, much of the glaring performance gap between the Russell 1000 and 2000 indexes can be explained by sector moves and weights. As shown in the following set of charts, S&P 500 Growth and Russell 1000 Growth are dominated by the Information Technology (Tech) and Consumer Discretionary sectors, while S&P 500 Value and Russell 1000 Value are dominated by Financials and Health Care. Specifically, Russell 2000 Growth is heavily influenced by Health Care and Tech, while Financials are by far the largest weight in Russell 2000 Value. Mind the sector weights Source: Charles Schwab as of 8/17/2022. Sector weights are based on iShares ETFs and are shown for informational purposes only. Tech\\'s weight alone in both large-cap Growth indexes helps to explain why Russell 2000 Growth has lagged over the decades—as Tech has been the top-performing sector since March 2009. It also supports the notion that Growth and Value index swings are often highly dependent on sector moves. Given that Tech and Consumer Discretionary make up more than 60% of S&P 500 Growth, their performance heavily biases the index\\'s moves. It\\'s not what you think Another detail to consider when it comes to indexes is the number of members within each index compared to the number of members that actually retain growth and value characteristics. Sticking with S&P data (given our limited access to Russell member data), you can see in the next pair of charts that growth stocks are becoming scarcer in S&P 500 Growth; the number of members peaked in 2014 at just below 350. Conversely, the number of members in S&P 500 Value has been on the rise since 2005. Shrinking growth and rising value… Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 7/31/2022. Yet, if we peel back a layer of the index onion and assess the number of members with growth and value characteristics, the picture looks different. As shown below, the number of stocks exhibiting a standard growth characteristic of five-year average sales growth above 15% amounts to slightly more than 100, which is largely unchanged from 2014 levels. Conversely, there are more than 440 stocks in the S&P 500 Value index, but only 72 that have a standard value characteristic of price-to-sales below 1.0. Suddenly, value now looks to be the scarcer style. …more like unchanged growth and shrinking value Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 7/31/2022. Growth stocks are defined as those with 5-year average sales growth above 15%. Value stocks are defined as those with price-to-sales below 1. Performance not only comes down to which sectors are biasing the respective indexes higher or lower; it stems from how many stocks are reflecting actual characteristics of growth and value. Hence, market calls for overweighting growth vs. value (or vice-versa) cannot be looked at simplistically through the index lens. Performance underneath the surface is sometimes markedly different from the action at the index level. Bursting bubbles and myths A prime historical example that puts the above information to work is the implosion of the tech bubble that brought the equity market down in the early 2000s. The aftermath of the bubble\\'s bursting led to a 57% decline in the S&P 500, a 78% decline in the Nasdaq, and an 83% decline in the tech-heavier Nasdaq 100—culminating in the crescendo low in October 2002. For investors who were on the hunt for deep value, the clear play from a factor perspective was the beaten-up Tech stocks. Many of the hardest-hit names were indeed trading at deeply undervalued prices, but were still \"housed\" in the Growth indexes. In fact, at the market\\'s bottom in October 2002, the forward price-to earnings (P/E) ratio1 of the Tech stocks within the S&P Growth index was 20.5—significantly lower than the 25.6 forward P/E of the Tech stocks within the S&P Value index. In other words, many of the cheapest Tech names were actually found in the Growth index. Not only did the classification detail matter for finding actual value, it mattered for forward performance. Looking specifically at the biggest casualty in that era, the Nasdaq 100, its members with lower multiples tended to fare better as the new bull market commenced. At the October 2002 low, the median Nasdaq 100 member\\'s forward P/E was 22.6. Those stocks with forward P/E of less than 22.6 (shown in the blue line the chart below) outperformed the cohort with forward P/E greater than 22.6 (the yellow line) by an average of nearly 200% in the ensuing decade. Thus, screening for the simple value characteristic of a less-expensive forward P/E yielded stronger returns—even in a heavily growth-oriented index. Finding value in growth Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg. Performance is shown from 10/9/2002 thru 10/9/2012. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Another example to consider is the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) era. At the overall stock market low in March 2009, Financials (the worst-performing sector during the crisis) had become a deep value play given the sector had fallen 83% from its pre-GFC peak. Indeed, the forward P/E of Financials within the S&P Value index (8.7) was less than that in the S&P Growth index (10.8), but there were inconsistencies within other sectors: Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs, the second-worst-performing cohort during the GFC (falling 79%), were trading at an average 15.5 forward P/E in the S&P Growth index vs. an average 25.2 forward P/E in the S&P Value index. (Equity REITs, part of the Financials sector during the GFC, were moved in 2016 to a separate Real Estate sector within the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS®.) The Consumer Discretionary sector (which fell 61%) was trading at a 14.9 forward P/E in S&P Growth vs. an 18.4 forward P/E in S&P Value. The Tech sector (which fell 55%) was trading at a 12.8 forward P/E in S&P Growth vs. a 15.2 forward P/E in S&P Value. Put another way, many of the less expensive (or value-oriented) members in the REITs, Consumer Discretionary, and Tech areas were housed in the S&P Growth index, not in the S&P Value index—so investors didn\\'t receive much value at all if they blindly bought a Value index without looking specifically for value. Applying factors in the current environment The moves underneath the stock market\\'s surface have been nothing short of treacherous over the past year—particularly in 2022 as the S&P 500, Russell 2000, and Nasdaq have plunged into bear market territory (defined as a drop of at least 20% from a peak). Rampant and massive shifts in sector leadership on a monthly, weekly, and even daily basis have made sector positioning over the short term an uncomfortable exercise. As such, assessing the direction of Growth and Value performance has been equally as difficult and head-spinning. Navigating the landscape from a factor-based approach has yielded less choppiness and more consistency, even in sectors that may not be considered growth- or value-oriented. For example, value factors have performed quite well in the growth-oriented Tech sector. As you can see in the chart below, within the Tech sector, the value factor of high free cash flow yield has outperformed the growth factor of long-term estimated earnings growth by a wide margin since the beginning of 2021 (though we have seen a convergence of the past couple of months). Value working well in growthy Tech Source: Charles Schwab, Piper Sandler, Bloomberg, as of 8/17/2022. Factors based on sector-neutral S&P 500. Free cash flow yield is defined as the last twelve months of free cash flow divided by the share price. Long-term growth is defined as mean estimated five-year earnings per share growth. Past performance is no guarantee of future. Looked at a different way, in a sector like Utilities (which can often be considered a \"value trap\" given that the sector\\'s forward P/E is greater than that of the S&P 500), until April 2022, neither the free cash flow yield nor long-term growth factor has offered a performance edge over the same timeframe. Only in the market\\'s rout since April has long term growth started to provide a bit more of a performance edge. Not much utility from Utilities Source: Charles Schwab, Piper Sandler, Bloomberg, as of 8/17/2022. Factors based on sector-neutral S&P 500. Free cash flow yield is defined as the last twelve months of free cash flow divided by the share price. Long-term growth is defined as mean estimated five-year earnings per share growth. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This is perhaps the essence of the growth vs. value debate. In a sector (Tech) that is generally dominated by members with cash flows expected much later in the future—and thus more adversely affected by a rising rate environment (in which we find ourselves today)—members that exhibit high-quality value are outperforming those that screen well on more pure growth factors. Conversely, in a sector like Utilities, which has a larger weight in Value indexes, value and growth factors have essentially matched each other\\'s performance and declined in tandem; and in the latest bout of market weakness, the growth-oriented factor of long term growth is outperforming. In sum Adopting a position on growth and value is a nuanced undertaking, especially at extremes in the market. Given the lagged and infrequent rebalancing of traditional Growth and Value indices, swift changes in sector leadership, and various definitions of pure growth and value characteristics, taking a stance on one style over the other cannot be done using a broad-based approach. We encourage investors to take more of a factor-based approach, given there are often important differences in the performance and construction of Growth and Value indexes vs. the factors/characteristics of growth and value. In essence, it pays to know what you\\'re buying. 1 The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a measure of valuation. It divides the current market value of a stock, group of stocks or index by the estimated earnings per share of the related company or companies for the next 12 months.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'We can all take steps to protect ourselves and our loved ones from financial fraud and exploitation.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, It\\'s often said that the best defense is a good offense, and this is definitely the case when it comes to preventing financial fraud and exploitation. You can be the victim of financial abuse at any age, but older Americans are often the most vulnerable. So, because today is World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, I\\'d like to provide some steps you can take now to protect your loved ones—and yourself. It\\'s a big problem and getting bigger As financial fraudsters become increasingly more sophisticated, their scams are proliferating and threatening the well-being of our aging population. It\\'s an unfortunate fact that as we age, we can suffer from what is often gradual but significant cognitive decline, often so subtle that it goes undetected for an extended period of time. Older adults who live alone can be the most vulnerable of all. In fact, nearly half of children with parents aged 65 or older say they are \"very\" or \"somewhat\" worried their parents have already become or will become less able to handle their personal finances over time. Even people with dementia, for example, can continue to feel confident about handling financial matters. The Federal Trade Commission reports that 37% of its consumer fraud complaints are received by those 60 and older. Yet, 97% of individuals over the age of 65 report that they are \"very confident\" or \"somewhat confident\" in their ability to make sound financial decisions. Defense checklist Here are a few steps you can take to protect your loved ones and yourself from becoming a victim. 1. Add a Trusted Contact Person to investment accounts Establishing a Trusted Contact Person is an important first step because it can help your financial institution move quickly and effectively when they suspect financial exploitation. A Trusted Contact Person is someone you designate to be your financial advocate. This person has no authority over your accounts, but is someone your financial institution can contact to discuss issues such as the status of your mental or physical well-being; activity on your accounts that might indicate possible financial exploitation or other limited circumstances as permitted by law. You can learn more about trusted contacts at FINRA. 2. Create or update a Durable Power of Attorney and a Revocable Living Trust A Durable Power of Attorney, unlike a Trusted Contact Person, authorizes a third party (referred to as your Agent or Attorney in Fact) to act on your behalf. The term \"durable\" means that it becomes active upon execution and remains active during periods of incapacity. There\\'s also a Springing Power of Attorney, which means that the power for a third party to act on your behalf only \"springs\" into effect when you are declared incapacitated. A Revocable Living Trust, sometimes called a living trust or inter vivo trust, is a way to title assets that can help you manage and protect your assets should you become ill, disabled or start to show signs of diminished mental capacity. While you’re living, the trustee (who might be you, although a co-trustee might also be named) is generally responsible for managing the property placed in the trust as you direct for your benefit. You can specify the powers and responsibilities of the trustee and contingent trustee. Some individuals choose a corporate trustee for continuity, expertise and impartiality, but you can also choose any individual you want. Regardless, the most important thing is that it\\'s someone you trust. Integrity, not financial acumen, is often the most important trait of a potential agent or trustee. 3. Shut down telemarketers Signing up for the National Do Not Call Registry at DoNotCall.gov can help reduce unwanted telemarketers (but not surveys, political calls or charities) from contacting you on your home or mobile phone. The DNC registry is managed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). There is no cost for this service. 4. Block spammers The DNC registry is effective in blocking marketers, but doesn’t stop spammers and fraudsters. My advice is to approach all calls, text messages and emails from unknown senders with extreme care. If you suspect a fraud, don’t answer or respond. Learn how to block these calls and emails in the future and delete them immediately. 5. Protect your credit If you\\'re concerned about identity theft, reported data breaches or someone gaining access to your credit report without your permission, you can freeze your credit report with the three major credit rating agencies (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) for free. And if you\\'re someone’s guardian, conservator or have a valid power of attorney, you can get a free freeze for that person, too. You can also place a fraud alert on your credit report, which can stop someone from opening new credit accounts in your name, but not prevent the misuse of your existing accounts. You still need to monitor all bank, credit card and insurance statements for fraudulent transactions. A credit freeze locks down your credit whereas a fraud alert allows creditors to get a copy of your credit report as long as they\\'re able to verify your identity. The length of time for a credit freeze to remain in effect varies by state. You can lift the freeze temporarily, either for a specific time period or for a specific reason; for example, to allow a potential landlord, lender or employer to get the information they need. You can still get access to your free annual credit report with a credit freeze in place. 6. Trust but verify It can be difficult to judge whether a request for information or financial help is legitimate—whether that’s from a business, app, or even a charity or a friend or family member. So take all the time you need to identify the parties you\\'re dealing with and the reasons they\\'re requesting personal information, financial access or your financial help. Don\\'t allow yourself to feel pressured or hesitate to get a second opinion from a trusted friend or family member. Bottom line Being a victim of financial fraud or exploitation can be financially and emotionally devastating. The stakes and risks increase as we age, so always be on the lookout for red flags. The good news is that we can all take steps to protect ourselves and our loved ones. Being vigilant and working with a team of trusted advisors, family members and friends can help establish meaningful safeguards. And remember that financial literacy isn\\'t just for kids! It also empowers adults of all ages with the information and skills we all need to make better financial decisions. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'Rising inflation, rate hikes, supply-chain problems and the Russia-Ukraine war have contributed to growing recession fears. While recessions are impossible to predict, we think the risk of one—sooner rather than later—has picked up.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Recession fear has risen swiftly this year. Inflation is rising at its fastest pace in decades, the Federal Reserve has begun what is expected to be an aggressive rate-hike cycle, global supply-chain problems persist, and the Russia-Ukraine war has upended commodity markets. All this has driven a rise in market volatility and fear of a coming economic downturn. We think the risk of a recession—sooner rather than later—has picked up. Intense market volatility, sour consumer confidence, and downward pressure on income growth all point to an economy that is slowing down. U.S. gross domestic product growth (GDP) contracted at a 1.5% annualized rate in the first quarter of 2022 (note that early GDP data is always subject to revision in later quarters). That was the first decline since the second quarter of 2020. While the trade and inventory components were largely responsible for the negative figure, the trend in consumer spending (which makes up about 70% of the U.S. economy) slowed throughout the quarter. What a recession is (and isn\\'t) This is a good time to remind investors that a U.S. recession is not—and has never been—defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. In fact, the 2001 recession only saw one quarterly GDP contraction; also, despite GDP contracting for two consecutive quarters in the mid-to-late-1940s, there was no recession. So the contraction in first-quarter 2022 GDP doesn\\'t necessarily mean a recession is beginning. The official arbiter of U.S. recessions is the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which defines recession as \"a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\" The four primary components that the NBER looks at to determine whether the United States is in a recession are—not coincidentally—the four indicators that make up The Conference Board’s Coincident Economic Index (CEI): real personal income less transfer payments; nonfarm payroll employment; wholesale and retail sales; and industrial production. As you can see in the chart below, the CEI tends to track the business cycle in real time, peaking at the start of recessions and finding a trough at the end of them. Coincident Economic Index Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 4/30/2022. Recessions are not a matter of \"if\" but simply a matter of \"when.\" News media often portray them as a catastrophe, but the reality is every economic cycle ends in a recession, allowing any excesses to be wrung out and thus making way for the start of a new cycle. To be sure, investors\\' muscle memory of the past couple recessions paints them in a rather unpleasant light: Both the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the global financial crisis in 2007-2008 sent shockwaves throughout world asset markets and spawned multiple, lasting crises (different in nature, of course). Barring some exogenous, unexpected event that sends yet another shock through the global system, we think the next recession will be a bit more (for lack of a better term) natural: The Fed hikes rates—sometimes aggressively—to combat inflation and/or growth that’s overheating, unemployment increases, the labor market weakens, incomes fall, and overall growth slows. Look to the leaders At any point in the cycle—and especially when a recession is on the horizon—it is useful to analyze leading economic indicators for clues as to where the economy is headed. The Leading Economic Index (LEI) from The Conference Board is an amalgamation of key indicators that move in advance of the business cycle. Covering the labor market, stock prices, and consumer/business confidence, among others, the LEI’s level and trend are perhaps the best indications of both the strength and durability of the phases of the cycle. Whenever discussing the LEI, we always like to remind investors that the indicators\\' trends are just as important—if not more important—than their levels. Individual components shouldn\\'t be looked at in isolation, and their strength in level terms often isn\\'t enough for a comprehensive analysis of inflection points, even in the run-up to recessions. As an example, below are snapshots of the LEI\\'s level and trend in the months prior to the start of the 2020, 2007, and 2001 recessions. Starting with the pandemic-driven recession in 2020, you can see in the first table below that most indicators were at either strong or fair levels. Given the rapidity with which the virus drove the world into a recession, trends within the LEI\\'s components were not particularly weak—but to be sure, there was more red and yellow in the trend column vs. the level column. 2020 recession Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, The Conference Board. Moving to the recession that started in 2007—famously sparked by the bursting of the subprime mortgage bubble—you can see below that trends were in worse shape—and unsurprisingly, housing activity (as reflected in building permits) had already started to weaken considerably. It was the labor and business spending areas that took a bit longer to catch up. 2007 recession Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, The Conference Board. Meanwhile, prior to the 2001 recession, the LEI\\'s trend column was almost a complete sea of red, as you can see in the table below. Not only that, but even the levels were in rough shape, with only building permits showing any degree of strength. Arguably, the chief reason for the souring economic data in advance of the start of the recession was the collapse in the stock market, courtesy of the bursting of the tech and telecom bubble that started in March 2000. From the peak in March 2000 through February 2001, the S&P 500 was down 17% and the Nasdaq was down 57% (of course, suffering even greater drawdowns until late 2002). Given households\\' historic exposure to stocks at the time, hits to confidence through the asset market channel were large enough to help accelerate the economy’s downturn. 2001 recession Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, The Conference Board. Inseparable A market-driven downturn has the potential to take shape, mostly due to the near-historic interconnectedness between the economy and the stock market. As you can see in the chart below, the value of corporate equities relative to U.S. GDP (known as the \"Buffett Indicator\" given its historical status as one of investor Warren Buffett\\'s favorite valuation metrics) is well over 200%, slightly off its all-time high but incredibly stretched relative to history. Stocks tied to the economy Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 3/31/2022. The Buffett indicator—along with other valuation metrics—is often used to argue that stocks are egregiously overvalued and due for an imminent downturn, particularly by market watchers who are bearish to begin with. While the drop in valuations and weak performance this year have confirmed both assertions, we\\'d emphasize that there is more to glean from looking at households\\' exposure to the overall stock market. Put simply, given the Buffett Indicator\\'s 200%-plus reading and households\\' outsized exposure to equities, there is a heightened degree of risk that if the bear market is deep and long-lasting, it may deal a greater hit to the economy by discouraging consumer confidence and spending. It also doesn\\'t bode well for stock market performance. As you can see in the chart below, high allocations to stocks (at extremes) historically have tended to lead to weak returns in the subsequent 10 years (shown by the yellow line).

Of course, one indicator isn\\'t the sole determinant or predictor of the path stocks end up taking, but investors should note that both the market and economy face an increasingly steep uphill climb in the near term. Fiscal and monetary policy are no longer stimulative, the world continues to struggle from rising interest rates and supply shocks, and pervasive inflation is actively denting income growth and spending power. Perpetual motion Along with the strength in the aforementioned leading indicators, investors should continue to take note of the energy sphere, as the spike in commodity prices this year has been consistent with prior recessions. As you can see in the chart below, inflation-adjusted crude oil prices have climbed well beyond their 24-month moving average; going back to the early-1970s, it\\'s been quite common for a recession to follow such a price rise. Only once (in August 2005) did the change move above 50% without a recession on its way (or already underway). Recession-like oil spike Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 5/31/2022. Y-axis is truncated for visual purposes; the actual peak was 242%. Energy spending as a share of overall U.S. consumption has waned over time, but the unfortunate reality is that higher oil and gasoline prices act as a regressive tax—especially for those on the lower end of the wealth and income spectrum. At a time when inflation is running hot and asset markets are under pressure, a jump in commodity prices can depress consumer confidence and lead to lower spending. In sum Despite the drop in consumer confidence and bearishness across survey data, consumer spending has held up so far this year, and the broader economy remains on solid footing in level terms. However, trends among leading economic indicators are crucial to watch, especially when approaching inflection points in the cycle. Put another way, we\\'ll emphasize our oft-used phrase: When it comes to the relationship between the stock market and economic data, \"better\" or \"worse\" tend to matter more than \"good\" or \"bad.\"'},\n",

       "   'content': 'In only a few years’ time, the cryptocurrency industry has exploded. From the now-ubiquitous tales of “Bitcoin millionaires” to the increasing number of companies jumping into the crypto arena, it’s hard to ignore the news—or the feeling that not owning cryptocurrency means missing out. The price of one bitcoin has ranged from $1,000 in early 2017 to more than $68,000 in November 2021—but with intense volatility, including periodic drawdowns of more than 50%, along the way. What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a virtual, digital, or “crypto” currency—so called because of the cryptography, or unchangeable coding techniques, involved in the blockchain code on which they exist. The intent of Bitcoin is to allow online payments to be made directly from one party to another through a worldwide payment system, without the need for a central third-party intermediary like a bank. Bitcoin is not issued by any central bank or government and is still not considered legal tender (meaning a national currency established by statute) in most countries. Like physical gold, Bitcoin’s value stems from a combination of its perceived scarcity and the perception that it can be a store of value, an anonymous means of payment, or a hedge against inflation, though none of these characteristics have yet to establish a long-term track record. What’s the relationship between Bitcoin and blockchain? Blockchain, the underlying technology that supports cryptocurrencies, is an open-source, public record-keeping system operating on a decentralized computer network (i.e., the internet) that records transactions between parties in a verifiable and permanent way. Blockchain provides accountability, as the records are intended to be immutable, which presents potential applications for many businesses. While blockchain has often been associated with cryptocurrencies, it has many potential uses beyond payments, including smart contracts, supply chain management, and financial services. Note that ownership of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is not an investment in blockchain, the technology, or its current or future uses. What is cryptocurrency, and how is it valued? Fiat currencies like U.S. dollars and euros are forms of money issued by governments to serve as legal tender. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, on the other hand, are “non-fiat,” non-governmental forms of “digital cash” to be used for electronic payments. The idea of “digital cash” isn’t new—it started with credit cards, PayPal, Venmo and other services’ need for easy, traceable electronic payments. But those payments are tied to fiat currencies managed by central banks, whereas cryptocurrencies are managed by technology, specifically cryptology. Proponents believe the value of a cryptocurrency is based on the quality of the cryptology, the number of cryptocurrency units created, and the technology that limits the creation of additional units. Like any traded item—think baseball cards—the value often depends on supply and demand: The fewer units available, the higher the price potential buyers are willing to pay. Why has Bitcoin become popular? Like many new technologies or products, Bitcoin attracted adherents interested in innovation and the perceived absence of governmental control. Traders saw it as an alternative to traditional investments such as stocks, bonds, and cash, and trading momentum led to a rising, if highly volatile, price. All of this attracted media attention, which has driven mainstream awareness and ultimately, increasing acceptance, and a market to trade it. While companies as varied as PayPal, Microsoft, Starbucks, and AT&T accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, such transactions typically involve a third party processor; thus its use in everyday commerce remains far outside the mainstream.1 Who oversees Bitcoin? Bitcoin was created based on a paper written in 2008 by a “founder” who goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, but no person or agency currently regulates it to ensure that it maintains value and liquidity and works as a means of payment. It’s governed by consensus of a private digital community according to guidelines based on the community, cryptology, and a network of computers. While individual countries may allow Bitcoin to be used as a means of payment, regulate the terms under which its citizens can trade or mine Bitcoin, and authorize the operation of cryptocurrency exchanges, they don’t regulate/control the existence or value of Bitcoin itself, or the blockchain code on which it operates. Bitcoin is promoted by the Bitcoin Foundation, but the foundation also does not control or manage Bitcoin’s trading or value. The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited by and managed by the original computer code and traded through one of several digital, decentralized exchanges. How many investors own Bitcoin? No one knows for sure, but according to a study released by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in December 2021, just 0.01% of account holders controlled 27% of the total bitcoin in circulation.1 Is Bitcoin the only cryptocurrency? No. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and it is the best known, most widely held, and—with about 46% of the total cryptocurrency market cap2—the most valuable. However, as of June 2022 there were more than nineteen thousand digital currencies in the marketplace, of which more than 40 had a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion. Some of the more popular cryptocurrencies include BNB, USD Coin, Cardano, Tether, Ethereum, Polkadot, and XRP. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and SEC Chair Gary Gensler both have stated that they didn’t intend to outlaw cryptocurrencies, but Gensler said the SEC was exploring how best to ensure that the industry protects investors and consumers and follows anti-money laundering and tax compliance laws. China already has launched a digital yuan in 2021 and it is estimated that at least 80 different countries around the world are exploring the idea of launching their own proprietary Central Bank Digital Currency. In March 2022, President Joe Biden signed an executive order outlining the U.S. government’s objectives, policies, and actions regarding cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and other digital financial instruments that utilize distributed ledger technology (i.e. blockchain). The purpose of the order is to ensure U.S. competitiveness in the crypto space, while also supporting responsible innovation; consumer and investor protection; financial stability and inclusion; and the reduction of illicit finance. Bottom line Schwab continues to monitor cryptocurrencies as regulations and technology evolve. While some traders have made money on the change in price of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies (and others have lost money), we suggest that most investors continue to treat them as a speculative asset primarily for trading with money outside a traditional long-term portfolio. 1 Quiroz-Gutierrez, M., “A minuscule .01% of Bitcoin holders control nearly a third of the supply,” December 20, 2021, Fortune. 2 According to June 13, 2022 data from coinmarketcap.com, indicating Bitcoin market cap of $0.452 trillion, and total global crypto market cap of $0.979 trillion.'},\n",

The Securities and Exchange Commission generally has been skeptical of cryptocurrencies, with chairs expressing concern that the product is too volatile, that investor protections are inadequate, and that regulations are insufficient, though current SEC Chair Gary Gensler has stated on several occasions that he had no intention of attempting to outlaw them. The agency has rejected multiple applications for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in Bitcoin over the last several years. In August 2021, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that he was open to the idea of ETFs that invested in cryptocurrency futures, but not those that invested in the spot markets, because the futures markets are already regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In October 2021 the first two Bitcoin futures ETFs—the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF)—were approved and launched. While a few others have followed, they are all limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum, as those are the only two cryptocurrencies for which an active futures market is currently established. Will Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies become the new global currency? Until there is appropriate regulation and consumer protections, we don\\'t think so, but time will tell. To be viable, a currency usually requires three characteristics: It can be used as an inexpensive, reliable medium of exchange; It can be a unit of account; It can be a store of value and legal tender honored as a means of payment. As long as Bitcoin is subject to high volatility and hefty transaction fees, it seems likely that it will have only limited use as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value. Another barrier to broader public acceptance as a true currency is that, as cryptocurrencies have become more widespread, the risk of regulation is on the rise—eliminating part of their appeal to those investors who perceive them as a currency not controlled by central bank policy or national governments. Can Bitcoin be used as a hedge against inflation? Because the value of Bitcoin is currently not tied to the value of a basket of goods or services, its value as an inflation hedge is a matter of speculation and is unpredictable. Throughout much of 2021 and 2022, Bitcoin experienced both sharp rallies and sharp price declines even though inflation data consistently ticked higher. Whether Bitcoin will prove to be an effective inflation hedge in the long run is yet to be determined. How are cryptocurrencies taxed? The IRS currently treats Bitcoin as property, not currency. Cryptocurrency transactions are taxable by the IRS whenever a taxable event occurs, such as selling Bitcoin for a fiat currency, paying for a product or service with Bitcoin or trading it for another asset. Currently, investors are responsible for tracking cost basis, gains, and other reporting. For help, refer to IRS Notice 2014-21, or consult with a tax advisor. However, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (IIJA) which was passed in November 2021 requires cryptocurrency exchanges to report cryptocurrency transactions on form 1099-B starting in 2023. Additionally, the IIJA will require that exchanges of $10,000 or more of cryptocurrency be reported to the IRS, similar to current form 8300 reporting requirements for cash transactions, also starting in 2023. However, it’s important to remember that this $10,000 reporting requirement does not mean that a cryptocurrency transaction of less than $10,000 is not taxable. The tax code states that “all income from whatever source derived” is taxable, even if it’s not reportable to the IRS. For example, an individual who sold $500 worth of items at a flea market would still owe taxes on that income, even though it was not reported to the IRS on a Form 1099. Are cryptocurrency trades subject to wash-sale rules? Tax experts believe that because the IRS currently considers cryptocurrencies to be property, not securities, losses are treated differently from those of stocks and mutual funds, so wash-sale rules generally don’t apply. However, as new rules are proposed and adopted, the IRS and the SEC are likely to issue new guidance on this subject in the future. What are some risks of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies? Financial loss. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices historically have been highly volatile, and fluctuations could result in significant losses if sold at the wrong time. Future regulation. Cryptocurrency issuance and trading is currently not well regulated, and additional oversight and regulation in the future is likely. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has noted her concern over cryptocurrencies being used \"for illicit financing.\" Fraud and cybercrime. These already have occurred. Given concerns above, cryptocurrencies could come under scrutiny from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), for noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering requirements. Bitcoin exchanges have been subject to computer outages caused by excessive demand, and because the ledgers are held on the internet, a large-scale cyberattack could limit access in an emergency—something less likely to happen with cash or gold. Theft or loss. A login ID and password is usually required to access a cryptocurrency exchange. If this is lost, hacked, or stolen, access could be denied or lost. While uncommon, bitcoins can be stored in physical wallets, so they can be spent without a computer; this creates the same risks inherent in all cash currencies: They could be lost, stolen, or destroyed by accident. Does Schwab recommend investing in cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are speculative investments, in our view. We don\\'t believe that Bitcoin fits within traditional asset allocation models at this time, as it is neither a traditional commodity, such as gold, nor a traditional currency. Bitcoin\\'s dramatic volatility is driven primarily by supply and demand, not inherent value. Bitcoin doesn\\'t have earnings or revenues. It doesn\\'t have a price-to-earnings ratio, price-to-sales ratio, or book value. Traditional value metrics don\\'t apply, so there are no methods for assessing its value that we endorse or find persuasive. Whether you should invest in cryptocurrencies depends on your goals and preferences as an investor, as it does with any asset or security. We suggest that clients approach it as a speculative investment and consider the high volatility and risks involved. For those who already have a diversified portfolio and a long-term investment plan, we see ownership of cryptocurrencies as outside the traditional portfolio. 1 Satoshi Nakamoto published the white paper \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\" on Oct. 31, 2008.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Cryptocurrencies have been getting a lot of attention lately. One could get whiplash from the tales of overnight millionaires who lost fortunes as quickly as they gained them. And no wonder: a single bitcoin ranged in price from $1,000 in early 2017 to more than $63,000 in April 2021—before plunging to $34,000 in late May. While Bitcoin is perhaps the best-known cryptocurrency, it has competition in Dogecoin, Ethereum, XRP, and many others (see “Crypto king,” below). Understandably, investors have questions about this emerging asset class. Here are answers to five of the most common. Crypto king Bitcoin’s market capitalization equals that of nearly all other top cryptocurrencies combined. Source: CoinMarketCap.com, as 06/24/2021. How do cryptocurrencies work? Cryptocurrencies let users store money and make and receive secure payments outside the traditional financial system while remaining anonymous. Cryptocurrencies run on a decentralized public ledger called a blockchain—a database of every transaction maintained by all of that currency’s users. How are cryptocurrencies managed? Unlike so-called fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro, which are managed and backed by central banks, cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning no single entity has control over how they’re governed. Instead, they’re driven by consensus and the peculiarities of the cryptocurrency itself. For example, bitcoins are “mined” using high-powered computers that solve exceedingly complex math problems. However, by design only 21 million bitcoins can ever be mined, making them a finite resource more akin to certain commodities than a printed currency. Are cryptocurrencies a legitimate asset class? Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly speculative investments, since supply and demand drive their volatility—not intrinsic value. That said, the cryptocurrency market has matured from its experimental phase into a unique and sizable asset class with a global market capitalization of some $1.5 trillion1 (see “Crypto roller coaster,” below). As a result, several established corporations and institutional investors have begun investing in Bitcoin. Crypto roller coaster The crypto market climbed from $370 billion in August 2020 to $2.2 trillion in April 2021—before losing $700 billion in value by June. Source: TradingView.com, as of 06/07/2021. What are the risks and drawbacks? As you might expect with a highly speculative investment, cryptocurrencies carry notable risks, including: Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices historically have been highly volatile, and fluctuations could result in significant financial losses. Fraud: According to the Federal Trade Commission, “Many people have reported being lured to websites that look like opportunities for investing in or mining cryptocurrencies, but are bogus.” And while login credentials are typically required to access a cryptocurrency exchange, these can be stolen or lost. Lack of recoverability: With conventional financial accounts, there’s normally a recovery process if you forget or misplace your login credentials. If you lose your cryptocurrency “key,” however, you cannot retrieve your cryptocurrency. Similarly if you lose access to the place where you store your key, you will effectively lose possession of your cryptocurrency. Should I invest in cryptocurrencies? Whether cryptocurrencies are right for you depends on your goals and risk tolerance. While some traders have made money on the dramatic swings in the price of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, others have found out the hard way that what goes up can most definitely come down. Thus, investors in this speculative asset should never venture more than they can afford to lose. 1TradingView.com, as of 06/07/2021. Cryptocurrencies at Schwab There are several ways to access cryptocurrency markets through Schwab: “Over-the-counter” cryptocurrency trusts—such as Grayscale® Bitcoin Trusts (GBTC and BCHG) and Grayscale Ethereum Trusts (ETHE and ETCG)—allow investors to trade shares in trusts holding large pools of a cryptocurrency, although these can involve high volatility, hefty fees, and other risks.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My daughter just graduated from college. Although she took several economics classes, when it comes to handling her own money, I think she could use a few more lessons. How can I help her become more financially aware and independent? —A Reader Dear Reader, It's so true that theory is one thing and practical life experience is another. And while I congratulate your daughter on her graduation and applaud her for taking economics classes, managing money as an adult is a whole different type of challenge. Even though more schools are offering personal finance classes, most young people just starting out can certainly use a refresher course. As parents, we're well aware of the myriad financial responsibilities our kids are going to face—new job, rent, insurance, savings, borrowing—all in an increasingly complex financial world. But in spite of the new challenges today's graduates may face, there are certain universal financial guidelines I believe are important for anyone at any age, and especially for a young person learning to manage their money for the first time. Here are some practical money management tips to share with your daughter. Live within your means—Start by looking at your needs vs. your wants. Use an online budgeting tool to add up essential expenses like rent, transportation, groceries, utilities, student loan payments, car payments, etc. Make saving a certain amount each month one of your essential expenses. Then subtract this total from your take-home pay. Realize that you can't spend more than what's coming in without it leading to trouble. Ultimately this will help you spend mindfully and control your money rather than having it control you. Make it automatic—Take advantage of online bill pay and direct deposit. Set up automatic payments for your regular monthly bills—as well as an automatic transfer from checking to savings. Whether it's for an emergency fund, retirement account or a new car, making your savings automatic gives you more time to focus on other things in your life. Prepare for the unexpected—Set aside a certain amount each month, no matter how small, for emergencies. Aim for enough to cover three-to-six months of essential expenses in case you're unable to work or you have to cover something like an emergency car repair. Keep this money someplace safe and easily accessible, such as in a savings account. Set goals and prioritize—Before you lay out any large sums of money, think through your priorities. What's more important to you: a new car or a vacation? Research prices and save accordingly. Plan for retirement—If your employer offers a 401(k), aim for an annual contribution of 10-15 percent of your income between what you contribute and any company match. At the minimum, contribute enough to get the full match. If you don't have a 401(k) or another employer-sponsored plan, open a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth can make a lot of sense when you're just starting out. Stay on top of student loans—Although most Federal student loan payments are currently paused, once they start again always pay at least the minimum on time each month. Get ahead of the game now by checking out studentaid.gov for information on repayment and possible loan forgiveness options. Be smart about credit—Charge only what's absolutely necessary and always pay off your monthly balance in full and on time. To make life easier, limit yourself to a single credit card, at least to start. Get insurance—Health insurance is an absolute must, as is car insurance if you own a vehicle. Renters insurance is relatively inexpensive once you have your own apartment. Disability insurance is a smart addition to protect your income. Learn to invest—Put your long-term money (for example, your retirement savings) to work by investing. A good first choice is a well-diversified stock mutual fund or exchange traded fund (ETF). Investing in stocks gives you the opportunity for long-term growth, which is valuable at any age, but especially when you're young. You don't need to be an investment expert. Stick with the fundamentals of keeping your costs low, your savings rate high, diversifying broadly, and investing for the long term. And don't be afraid to ask for help from an advisor. Keep the conversation going Sharing this information is a good start, but don't stop there. Learning about money management is a process, not a one-time lesson. So continue to talk to your daughter about how to prioritize her finances and the importance of financial responsibility. As she becomes more independent, stay open and involved. Listen to her struggles, be proud of her successes and help her understand that it's up to her to control her money. Let her know, too, that you'll always be there to help her out with advice and support. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Do your children have income-generating assets in a custodial account? If so, be sure you understand the so-called kiddie tax. This law was passed to discourage wealthier individuals from transferring assets to their children to take advantage of their lower tax rates. The kiddie tax has seen many iterations (see \"Refund, anyone?\" below), but current rules tax a minor child\\'s unearned income—including capital gains distributions, dividends, and interest income—at the parents\\' tax rate if it exceeds the annual limit ($2,300 in 2022). The tax applies to dependent children under the age of 18 at the end of the tax year (or full-time students younger than 24) and works like this: The first $1,150 of unearned income is covered by the kiddie tax\\'s standard deduction, so it isn\\'t taxed. The next $1,150 is taxed at the child\\'s marginal tax rate. Anything above $2,300 is taxed at the parents\\' marginal tax rate. If your child also has earned income, say from a summer job, the rules become more complicated. To learn more, see IRS Publication 9291 or consult a tax advisor. Refund, anyone? If your family paid the kiddie tax in prior years, you could be eligible for a refund. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 effectively raised the kiddie tax by basing it on the tax rates used for estates and trusts, instead of the rates used for parents. That change has since been repealed, so if you calculated your child\\'s liability using estate and trust tax rates, you may have the option to file an amended return using your tax rate for your child\\'s unearned income instead.

Uncertainty It\\'s often said that markets hate uncertainty. In the first half of 2022, economic uncertainty in Europe was higher than during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, it was higher than any other time in the past two decades, except right after the Brexit referendum in June 2016, according to the Economic Policy Uncertainty indexes developed by Baker, Bloom and Davis. Economic uncertainty index Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 6/3/2022. As the second half of the year drew near, there were some signs of easing uncertainty which seemed to help stocks rebound from their lows of mid-May. The war in Ukraine has shown no signs of ending, but also no signs that natural gas supplies from Russia to Europe will be cut off—an event that would likely lead to an economic recession. Economic data in Europe has remained resilient despite the conflict, perhaps due to pent-up savings from lingering COVID-induced restrictions on household spending over the past two years. Severe lockdowns in response to the latest COVID-19 outbreaks resulted in a sharp economic slowdown in China—the world\\'s second largest economy—but as restrictions began to lift, economic data began to sharply rebound. As people were able to leave their homes in major cities and economic stimulus accumulated, the surprisingly big gains in China\\'s May Purchasing Managers\\' Index suggest the worst of the economy\\'s slump may be over. While supply chains remain stretched and delivery times are still lengthy, they have shown some signs of improvement. Inventories have been rebuilding, with some retailers such as Walmart, Kohl\\'s, and Target reporting excess inventories in some products in May. Some central banks remain focused on reining in pandemic stimulus but clarified their intentions on the near-term path for rates: reducing the likelihood of 75-basis-point (bp) rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve or a 50-bp hike from the European Central Bank. While the modest easing in uncertainty was welcome news for investors in recent weeks, economic risks remain that may continue the above-average stock market volatility we had forecast for 2022. Risks In December of last year, our article \"Top Global Risks for 2022\" cites the risks that may weigh on increasingly volatile stock markets for the coming year. Stocks around the world have fallen this year mostly due to two of these risks: We noted the heightened risk of geopolitical conflict: \"An invasion of Ukraine by Russia could prompt world powers to impose new sanctions which may elevate energy cost inflation.\" We also highlighted the risk of stagflation (a stagnant economy combined with high inflation), cautioning that: \"with valuations above average in many countries, markets aren\\'t priced for even a small risk of stagflation…leaving central banks with no good options for monetary stimulus and pushing markets into a downfall.\" Concerns over a global economic recession have grown this year, due primarily to high inflation, further boosted by the war in Ukraine, and central bankers\\' efforts to tamp down inflation through tighter monetary policy. Economists\\' 2022 GDP forecasts have slumped in the first half of the year for most major countries with growth estimates cut by 1% or more, as you can see in the chart below. Canada is the exception, thanks to strong demand for its natural resources. Economic estimates for 2022 falling Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 6/1/2022. In contrast to this weaker economic outlook, analysts have been raising earnings per share estimates. Most countries have seen earnings estimates climb meaningfully since the start of the year, as you can see in the chart below. Earnings estimates for 2022 rising Source: Charles Schwab, FactSet data as of 6/1/2022. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Europe is the exception, with the earnings growth outlook appearing to have lagged the improvements seen elsewhere. But that is largely because we are measuring earnings growth in U.S. dollars; the euro has fallen versus the dollar by more than 6% this year. Measured in euros, European earnings are now expected to climb over 13% in 2022—up eight percentage points from the start of the year, even faster than in the U.S. and mirroring the climb seen elsewhere. It is rare to see a divergence in the direction of the economic and earnings forecasts, so why now? It isn\\'t that economists and analysts have different outlooks, it\\'s that they have different tasks. For example, rising energy prices in the current environment may act as a drag on the economy but may boost earnings for the energy companies that make up the indexes. Also, the current rapid growth in business investment contributes more to corporate earnings than it does economic activity. While investors have been focused on the slowdown in the economic outlook for much of the first half of the year, the direction of earnings may be more important to stock prices than GDP for the second half. If earnings remain solid, stocks may rebound. In fact, the price-to-earnings ratio (PE) for international stocks, represented by the MSCI EAFE Index, has rarely been lower than it is today outside of a recession (the history of analysts\\' estimates for the next 12 months of earnings begins in 1988, allowing us to look at nearly 35 years of the forward PE ratio), as you can see in the chart below.

Ideas Investors may want to consider these investing ideas in the second half of 2022: Diversification - We have been recommending strategic weights across asset classes and sectors this year, not because we don\\'t have any ideas but because diversification itself is an especially good idea right now in the current period of heightened volatility. The correlation across stock markets has fallen to among the lowest levels in 20 years and portfolios benefit from diversification as sectors and markets move more independently of each other.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. International - Historically, when long-term inflation expectations are rising, it has led international stocks to outperform U.S. stocks. International markets tend to be more inflation sensitive, with more companies that benefit from higher inflation than those that suffer. While there can be no guarantees, international stocks have been outperforming in recent months—just as the long-term relationship forecast that it would.

In other words, stocks with more immediate cash flows, rather than cash flows in the distant future, tended to outperform after rates bottomed in 2020, and are more dominant in international markets. Short duration stocks outperforming long duration stocks Source: Charles Schwab, FactSet data as of 6/03/2022.

Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Buybacks - As we forecast in our 2022 outlook, those companies around the world that are announcing new or increased stock buybacks seem to be benefitting from more price support than those that don\\'t, as measured by the Solactive Buyback Indexes. These indexes track the performance of stocks whose management has announced plans to repurchase shares within the prior two months. In general, buybacks are seen by investors as a sign that a company has good cash flow and a strong balance sheet. These indicators are usually considered hallmarks of a high-quality company.

Shortages can cost companies growth opportunities, but gluts can negatively impact earnings expectations as demand and prices fall. Keeping an eye on inventories can be crucial to determining when and where gluts may form. Economic uncertainty may have peaked in the first half of 2022, but it remains high. Having a well-balanced, diversified portfolio, with a risk profile consistent with your goals, and being prepared with a plan in the event of an unexpected outcome are keys to successful investing.

See more about the market later in this report. Soft or hard landing? Clearly, a 40-year high in inflation, an aggressive tightening of monetary policy by the Fed, the Russia/Ukraine war, and the slowdown in economic growth have weighed on stocks this year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth contracted in the first quarter, while estimates for the second quarter are fairly anemic (albeit positive so far). As shown below, the big drag in the first quarter was net exports, with government spending and inventories also contributing to the weakness. The outlook for the second quarter is for private inventories and net exports to remain a drag, along with residential investment (housing).

Forecasts contained herein are for illustrative purposes only, may be based upon proprietary research and are developed through analysis of historical public data. Much economic debate centers around whether a recession is likely. History\\'s lessons about the impact of Fed rate hike cycles—there were 10 recessions associated with the past 13 rate hike cycles, and only three soft landings—suggest a recession is more likely than a soft landing. When you add into the mix the Russia/Ukraine war, elevated inflation, growth already under pressure and the Fed simultaneously starting to shrink its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet, arguably the needle has moved more toward recession. No longer spoon(Fed) Among the most important shifts in the macroeconomic backdrop over the past year has been the receding liquidity tide, courtesy of a double-barreled reduction in monetary and fiscal stimulus. The U.S. economy and asset markets greatly benefited from the epic jolt from trillions of dollars\\' worth of liquidity doled out by the Federal Reserve and Congress. As such, money supply spiked at a breakneck pace, as shown below. Liquidity tidal wave Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, as of 4/30/2022. M2 is a measure of the U.S. money stock that includes M1 (currency and coins held by the non-bank public, checkable deposits, and travelers\\' checks) plus savings deposits (including money market deposit accounts), small time deposits under $100,000, and shares in retail money market mutual funds. Annual growth in the money supply peaked at 27% in February 2021 and has rolled over significantly, now edging closer to its pre-pandemic rate. In conjunction with a Fed that is now raising rates at a rather aggressive pace (one 25-basis-point and one 50-basis-point hike so far, with another couple of 50-basis-point hikes expected near-term) and starts reducing its balance sheet this month, it is clear that the accommodative phase of the current cycle is well in the rearview mirror. The chief reason for the Fed\\'s aggressive posture is undoubtedly the hotter inflationary environment. The most acute pressures have come from the goods side of the economy—courtesy of the forced, rapid shift in spending habits during the pandemic and reeling supply chains. Services inflation has also started to move up in a more sustained manner, as shown below. Passing the baton Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 4/30/2022. As expected, goods inflation has come off the boil recently, falling from a peak annual growth rate of 12.3% in February to 9.7% in April; meanwhile, core services inflation is increasing at a 4.9% annual rate, the fastest since 1991. We expect this dynamic to continue to play out, given recent consumption and company data underscoring a clear shift in consumer preferences from goods to services spending. While that may bode well for the Fed\\'s goal of softer inflation prints in the future, we\\'d point out a few risks: Services components of inflation metrics like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) command a heavier weight than goods components; thus, a sustained increase keeps headline inflation at a more elevated level. A significant reduction in goods inflation may result in a continued compression of (mainly goods-oriented) companies\\' profit margins. Any hit to margins and (subsequently) profits may slow wage growth to a swift degree, ultimately leading to a slower recovery in labor force participation. Reducing supply of demand One of the culprits of higher inflation has been the significant increase in home prices and, in turn, rental costs. The shelter component of the CPI has marched higher this year, which isn\\'t surprising given the overheating of the housing market throughout the pandemic. Sky-high home prices, bidding wars, and a constrained supply of homes sent many would-be buyers into the rental market. That put upward pressure on rents and led to a deterioration in consumers\\' confidence in buying homes, shown below. Not building confidence Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics, The Leuthold Group, University of Michigan (UMich). CPI as of 4/30/2022. Consumer sentiment as of 5/31/2022. The historical relationship between homebuying conditions and rental inflation suggests the latter may catch down to the former. Right now, the relationship seems to have broken down, but rents are facing a building number of headwinds—not the least being a contraction in inflation-adjusted income, the coming wave of new multifamily homes, and the prospect of weaker demand as the Fed hikes interest rates. If consumer confidence remains persistently dour, we think that housing demand destruction may kick in sooner rather than later, effectively bringing down rental costs. Mortgage payments have soared this year, as shown below, while the backlog of unsold homes has risen for four consecutive months. In fact, the increase in the backlog from 6.9 months to 9.0 months was a two standard-deviation move. There has never been an inventory backlog of nine months or more without a recession near or underway (hat tip to David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research). Mortgage pain Another key reason demand may falter moving forward is the drastic reduction in consumer savings over the past year. As shown below, the personal savings rate has collapsed from its pandemic peak and fallen to 4.4%, the lowest since September 2008. While that reduction has coincided with relatively strong consumer spending, the rub is that individuals\\' borrowing has picked up markedly, as shown by the spike in revolving credit which, relative to its 12-month average, is at its highest since 1996 (also shown below). Save less, borrow more Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg. Revolving credit as of 3/31/2022. Personal savings rate as of 4/30/2022. We expect a continued slowdown in real consumer spending courtesy of declining real incomes, slowing wage and employment growth, tighter lending standards and the decline in net worth. In the case of real personal disposable income, it has been flat since February, contributing to weak consumer confidence. No confidence As we highlighted in our 2022 outlook, there remains a yawning gap between consumers\\' expectations for the future and their assessment of their current situation. As shown below, the spread has never been this low other than in the lead-in to recessions. Can\\'t see the future? Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, The Conference Board, as of 5/31/2022. It\\'s not just consumers that are feeling the heat of high inflation and weak growth. CEO confidence has plunged as well, as shown below. We believe the current destocking of excess inventories on the goods side of the economy will persist into the second half of the year. Many of the world\\'s most dominant retailers have announced that they added too much stock and/or too many employees. As they bring down inventories, this will exacerbate the expected weakness in manufacturing production. Longer-term, we remain very optimistic about the investment/capital spending side of the economy, regardless of the likely near-term softness. However, near-term, companies are likely to keep spending/investment in check until the macro backdrop improves. CEO confidence has imploded Source: Charles Schwab, The Conference Board Measure of CEO ConfidenceTM in collaboration with The Business Council, as of 2Q2022. No easy task A key question moving forward is whether the labor market and broader economy can withstand the aforementioned pressure associated with inflation and the attendant aggressive hiking cycle. The channel through which the Fed hopes to reduce demand in the economy is tighter financial conditions since it can\\'t directly influence the supply side of the economy. Thus far, the effort has brought some success as a lot of air has come out of asset markets and interest-sensitive areas of the economy. As shown below, financial conditions have tightened at a rapid pace over the past year, which has been consistent with a softening in economic activity, but also \"projects\" further softening in the ISM Manufacturing Index—a key leading economic indicator. Conditions no longer easy Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 4/30/2022. Goldman Sachs (GS) Financial Conditions Index (FCI) is defined as a weighted average of riskless interest rates, the exchange rate, equity valuations, and credit spreads, with weights that correspond to the direct impact of each variable on GDP. As the economic cycle gets longer in the tooth and financial conditions continue to tighten, the Fed\\'s chances of successfully engineering a soft landing may narrow. A glaring focus on the inflation mandate has left the employment mandate largely ignored for now—and for the \"right\" reasons in the mind of the Fed, given labor demand heated up throughout the pandemic and payroll gains have been strong. The likelihood of the Fed maintaining an aggressive policy stance without an attendant impact on the labor market is fairly low. We expect lower payroll gains as the year progresses, though perhaps not imminently. Another risk of reining in inflation is the implicit reduction in companies\\' profit margins, which are highly correlated with headline inflation metrics like CPI. Several goods-oriented companies have already started to cite headwinds, if not already seeing large hits to margins as inventories have soared. Any significant and persistent reduction in margin growth would likely lead to a bit of a vicious circle of weaker profits, slower wage growth, reduced hiring, and eventual layoffs. Unfortunately, we have already started to see some wobbling in the labor market, as initial jobless claims turned higher in March and job cuts are now rising year-over-year for the first time since the beginning of 2021, as shown below. Job cuts return Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 4/30/2022. While some segments of inflation have likely peaked, the burning question for the Fed and investors is how fast will price pressures recede? If the inflation plane settles at a level higher than what the Fed is comfortable with, the risk of a persistently aggressive policy stance will increase. As such, that may lead to a faster reduction in demand, corporate profits, and labor supply—thus rendering the Fed\\'s goal of a soft landing unachievable. A key ingredient to a possible path to a soft landing would likely be a reversal in the labor market dislocations brought on by the pandemic. Finally, on the economy, a recent Domash and Summers paper detailed the fact that, historically (since 1955), when the average quarterly inflation rate rose to above 5%, the probability of a recession over the subsequent two years was more than 60%. Over the same span, when the unemployment rate dropped below 4% the probability of recession over the subsequent two years was about 70%. Combining the two, there has never been a quarter with average inflation above 4% and the unemployment rate below 5% that was not followed by recession within the subsequent two years. Don\\'t fight the Fed The late-great Marty Zweig, my first boss and mentor, coined the phrase, \"don\\'t fight the Fed,\" and stocks have clearly heeded his message this year. Undoubtedly, the first leg of the correction/bear market was tied to the prospects of tighter monetary policy, while the second leg was tied to slower growth. Stocks have priced in a lot of negative news; but another down leg is possible if earnings growth expectations falter from here. Although earnings revisions recently hooked back up, as shown below, the trend has generally been down, and we expect that to persist (with fits and starts). Earnings revisions hook back up Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 5/27/2022. Revisions index measures the number of equity analyst revisions upgrades (positive) and downgrades (negative). Valuations have come down alongside stock prices as shown in the first chart below, but at this point in the economic/earnings cycle, the trajectory of earnings matters more than the level of earnings.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Bear market rallies We expect continued rallies like the one that led into Memorial Day Weekend. However, for now, they are likely counter-trend rallies in an ongoing correction/bear market. As shown below, for all three major indexes, breadth has weakened considerably. The percentage of stocks trading above their 200-day moving averages has turned up, but early stages of sustainable bull moves are typically marked by broader \"breadth thrusts\" (an indicator also pioneered by Marty Zweig, along with Ned Davis). In addition, the S&P 500\\'s 50-day moving average remains below its 200-day moving average, implying that the primary market trend remains down. Ideally, we want to see a very elevated percentage of stocks rallying together to feel more confident, although a couple of shorter-term breadth indicators—based on stocks above their 10-day moving averages and five-day advancers vs. decliners—both gave short-term bullish signals last week. Major indexes\\' breadth Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 5/27/2022. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Bright spot potentially on horizon As regular readers know, we keep a close eye on investor sentiment as a contrarian indicator when it hits extremes. The percentage of bulls in the AAII Sentiment Survey recently hit a 30-year low, although that has not yet been matched by other more behavior-oriented sentiment indicators (like the put/call ratio and/or fund flows). What\\'s interesting is the spread between what investors (and/or consumers) are saying and what they\\'re doing. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index peaked in April of 2021 and is now at levels not seen in more than a decade. On the other hand, AAII\\'s April survey about its members\\' asset allocation showed nearly 70% was allocated to equities—just shy of the 71.4% high-water mark this cycle from November 2021. The data is shown below, courtesy of Ned Davis Research. Even though the two surveys are measuring different groups and asking different questions, they have tracked each other closely over time—until a year ago. History suggests the divergence is unlikely to persist. Near-term, we would expect the allocation to equities to catch down to the more dour sentiment about the economy.

A crowd favorite among the sentiment indicators we watch is the relationship between the positioning of \"Dumb Money\" and \"Smart Money\" per data collected by SentimenTrader (those monikers are theirs, not ours). The Confidence Spread recently reached the upper decile of historical (since 2000) readings. Historically, when the spread crossed above 63% for the first time in three months, the forward returns for the S&P 500 were generally strong—especially over the subsequent two months. It suggests a further rebound could be in the offing near-term. Smart money more optimistic Source: Charles Schwab, SentimenTrader, as of 5/27/2022. SentimenTrader\\'s Smart Money Confidence and Dumb Money Confidence Indexes are used to see what the \"good\" market timers are doing with their money compared to what the \"bad\" market timers are doing and are presented on a scale of 0% to 100%. When the Smart Money Confidence Index is at 100%, it means that those most correct on market direction are 100% confident of a rising market. When it is at 0%, it means good market timers are 0% confident in a rally. The Dumb Money Confidence Index works in the opposite manner. In sum Although the S&P 500 has so far escaped a traditional bear market based on the level of the index using closing prices, the weakness under the surface is clearly in bear market territory. The Nasdaq, Russell 2000, and many of the speculation-driven segments of the market are definitively in bear markets. Sharp rallies are par for the course during bear markets, so investors could be in for more of the same. Another leg down for the market could be precipitated by a weakening earnings and profit-margins outlook. We are looking for better news on the inflation front before expecting the Fed to consider a breather in terms of rate hikes. We are also looking for stronger market breadth—including a high percentage of stocks moving higher together. In the meantime, this is not a market likely to reward excessive risk-taking and we continue to recommend adhering to the disciplines of diversification (across and within asset classes) as well as the power of periodic rebalancing (which forces investors to add low and/or trim high). We continue to recommend that stock-picking-oriented investors focus more on factors than sector or traditional-style indexes. Given high inflation, rising short rates, and weakening growth outlooks, factors we believe will continue to perform better in relative terms are strong free cash flow, healthy (cash-rich, low-debt) balance sheets, positive earnings revisions, and low volatility. Lastly, when markets become more volatile and weakness takes over from strength, we always remind investors that panic is not an investing strategy.'},\n",

Help establish a Roth IRA A jump-start on retirement savings can help pave the way for financial well-being down the road. \"A Roth IRA, in particular, is a great way to go because the money can grow tax-deferred during their working years, and withdrawals in retirement could be tax-free,\"1 says Chris Kawashima, CFP®, a senior research analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Note that your contribution toward a Roth IRA will be limited to your grad\\'s total earned income or the annual maximum ($6,000 in 2022 for individuals younger than 50)—whichever is less. 2. Help them buy stock Introducing young people to the inner workings of the stock market is a lesson in financial literacy. \"Helping them invest a cash gift allows you to teach them important concepts, such as research, diversification, and rebalancing, to maintain their ideal asset allocation,\" Susan says. 3. Lighten their student loan load Federal loan forgiveness measures may be on the horizon, but for now the average undergraduate loan debt is $32,300, according to the Department of Education.2 Instead of contributing a lump sum, however, you might match their student loan payments for a specified period. \"That way, they\\'re still on the hook for practicing good money habits like paying their bills on time,\" Susan says. Monetary gifts aside, one of the best things you can give a new grad is the benefit of insight. \"Imparting some of your own hard-earned wisdom—including your mistakes—can help them make smarter financial decisions in their own lives,\" Chris says. 1 To qualify for tax-free withdrawals of earnings, account holder must be 59½ or older and have owned the account for at least five years. 2 National Center for Education Statistics (2021).

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I have a special needs child. He just turned 5 and has been diagnosed with some severe learning disabilities. I\\'m a single mom and don\\'t have much money to invest but would like to do something for his future. I\\'ve been told this could affect some of his government benefits. I have life insurance and a will, but how can I put money aside for him? —A Reader Dear Reader, Planning for the financial future for any child is no easy task. Planning for a child with special needs, especially if you have limited resources, is even more challenging. You\\'ve made a great start by having life insurance and a will. Putting money aside for the present—and the future—is the next step. One of the biggest challenges for people with disabilities and their families has been how to save and invest to cover disability-related expenses without losing public benefits. You may have heard of a special needs trust, which is one way to set aside and protect assets for your son, but it can be somewhat complex and costly to set up. There is, however, a simpler, lower-cost solution available—a 529 ABLE account. ABLE accounts, established in 2014, allow people to save and invest without being subject to strict asset limits ($2,000 for an individual) to receive federal means-tested benefits such as Supplemental Social Security Income (SSI). Plus, they\\'re easy to open, flexible and provide certain tax advantages. Let\\'s talk about how an ABLE account works and the potential benefits. The basics Similar to 529 college savings plans, ABLE accounts are offered at the state level but you don\\'t have to enroll in your own state\\'s program. You can open an ABLE account in any state that accepts outside residents. Any individual who has a qualifying disability before age 26 is eligible for an ABLE account. The account is opened in the name of and for the benefit of the person with the disability and money in the account must be used specifically for the beneficiary. The maximum annual contribution is currently $16,000. Lifetime contribution limits vary by state and can be as high as $500,000, however a lower limit of $100,000 generally applies when determining eligibility for SSI benefits. What\\'s more, ABLE assets don\\'t affect eligibility for Medicaid benefits, although money that isn\\'t used during your son\\'s lifetime may have to be paid back to Medicaid for disability-related expenses. Added advantages On top of the ability to save without jeopardizing government benefits, an ABLE account is appealing for a lot of other reasons, including: Account opening minimums are low—Minimums required to open an account vary by state, but some are as low as $25. That makes it easy to get started. Deciding how much you can afford to contribute each month and then setting up an automatic contribution can be a convenient and smart move. Family and friends can contribute—If there are grandparents, other family members or friends who want to help, an ABLE account provides an easy way for them to contribute. Just remember that the annual contribution limit I mentioned above includes contributions from all sources. The money can be used for a wide variety of expenses—Here\\'s one of the real perks. While the money must be used to pay for \"qualified\" disability expenses, the definition is very broad. Basically, it includes almost anything to maintain or improve the quality of life of the beneficiary—education, housing, transportation, assistive technology, employment training, financial management, healthcare—to name just some. Plus the funds can be used over the course of the beneficiary\\'s lifetime. You can grow the money by investing—Here\\'s another plus. Most plans offer investment as well as savings options, so you can prepare for the future as well as pay for the present. Depending on your son\\'s needs and timeline, you could decide to invest a certain amount in a conservative, moderate or aggressive portfolio. As with any investment plan, be sure to check things like investment choices, fees and minimums, and consider your risk preferences and investment time horizon before you invest. You\\'ll get some tax breaks—Like 529 college savings plans, you don\\'t get an upfront federal tax deduction for contributions to an ABLE account, but earnings grow tax-free and withdrawals for qualified expenses are also income tax free. Some states offer additional tax breaks for residents who enroll in their home state\\'s plan. You can check with the ABLE Resource Center to see what your state offers and compare it with other states. An ABLE account can be a good start While an ABLE account can let you set aside money for your son\\'s future at the same time that you build up some reserves for current expenses, it\\'s not the only solution. A special needs trust is also an option if you need a more customized approach. As you\\'re planning, it\\'s also important to factor in other state or local benefits your child is eligible for as well as how an ABLE account works together with your overall estate and insurance needs. A special needs advisor can help I understand all this can seem overwhelming, so you might want to check in with a special needs advisor. It\\'s possible that the HR department of the company you work for may offer assistance with special needs planning. There are also attorneys and financial planners who specialize in helping families and caregivers with special needs individuals, including: Special Needs Alliance (specialneedsalliance.org) National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys (naela.org) A special needs advisor can help you review titling of investment accounts and life insurance, evaluate financial resources and help you plan ahead. While the upfront costs may seem steep, working with the right professionals can help save you time, money, headaches—and heartaches—down the road. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My boyfriend and I are getting married this fall. Between his student loans and wanting to buy a house in a few years, we\\'re already pretty stressed. At the same time, I\\'m feeling a lot of pressure to have an \"Instagrammable\" wedding. Any suggestions for how we can do this without busting our budget? —A Reader Dear Reader, Thank you for this timely and thoughtful question. According to forecasts I\\'ve read, you\\'re in great company. A recent Wedding Report predicts there will be 2.5 million weddings in 2022, the most since 1984! This is happy news for all the couples who are starting their lives together (many of whom waited for the pandemic to subside), but unfortunately not such great news for everyone\\'s budgets. When you combine the current rate of inflation with the added price pressure from competition for wedding locations, vendors and materials, weddings have become more expensive than ever. And as you mention, adding to this financial stress is the pressure to make everything look great on social media. Take a step-by-step approach So as tempting as it may be to spend lavishly on your wedding, I commend you for not losing sight of your other financial goals. And the good news is that you don’t have to. Despite all of the pricing and social pressures, you can still have a memorable and beautiful wedding without breaking the bank. Let’s take a look at some ways you can make this happen. Decide how much you can spend overall—Once you’ve thought about the type of wedding you want, determine the maximum amount you want to spend—all within the context of your other goals. Besides covering your student loan payments and saving for a house, what other goals do you have? List them along with when you want to reach them. For example, do you want to save for a honeymoon in three months? Buy a car in two years? Also, if you’re thinking about borrowing, make sure you have a realistic plan for paying it off. Credit cards can present an easy and convenient solution at the time, but can cause more problems down the road if not used wisely. Create a line-item budget—Next, put down everything you can imagine from big-ticket items like venue, food and flowers right down to postage for invitations. Don\\'t guess. Research and get real numbers. This is the time to identify \"must haves\" vs. “nice-to-haves\" as I always suggest for a monthly budget. That will give you some room to make trade-offs as you make specific decisions. Be sure to include an overage percentage, as unexpected items always appear. Track your spending—I often talk about mindful spending, and a wedding is as good a time as any to put this into practice. The best way to keep costs under control is to keep track of every expenditure. A spreadsheet (or even a wedding notebook) can help you stay on top of each purchase as well as the growing total amount. By keeping the numbers up-to-date and in front of you, you’ll have fewer surprises later. Be creative—Sticking to a wedding budget doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t have everything you want. From online printing for invitations, to doing your own flowers, to a buffet instead of a served meal, to having friends and family take pictures, there are ways to cut costs and still have the beauty and style you envision. You just have to think creatively and not be afraid to ask. Does a friend have a large property that could be a perfect wedding venue? Do you know a novice photographer who would love to have your wedding in their portfolio? Your wedding is for you, and no one else A budget is essential, but planning a wedding is part head and part heart. Money aside, only you and your fiancé can envision the type of wedding that will be most meaningful to you. Don’t let yourself get caught up in someone else’s expectations or the image you feel is expected by social media. Your wedding should be a lasting memory for you, not an exercise in impressing anyone else. Take care of your money, long-term For many couples, planning a wedding is the first time they deal with financial issues together. So use this opportunity to flex your communication muscles and build your relationship. Listen to each other’s perspectives and be willing to make compromises. Once you’ve taken the time to think about, plan and budget your wedding in the context of all your goals and your life together as a married couple, I believe you’ll feel great about whatever type of wedding you choose—whether that’s a backyard barbeque or a lavish party.

       "   'content': \"Stocks, bonds, and cash are all in a bear market or teetering on the edge of one—a very rare event. Over the past 72 years, there have only been two periods with a triple bear—both took place in the 1970s. The three bears Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 5/20/2022. Stock market represented on log scale indexed to 100 on Dec 31, 1969. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. On Friday, the S&P 500 and MSCI World Index both briefly slipped into bear market territory before recovering by the end of the day, closing very near the -20% threshold from the market peak on January 4, 2022. U.S. bond yields have jumped in 2022, posting their worst start to a year on record. Other bond markets around the world have also performed poorly. The trend in German bond yields reflects the U.S., trending lower since the early 1980s until recently. Both the U.S. and German 10-year bonds have suffered a loss of just under 10% on a total return basis so far this year. The return on cash, represented by three-month U.S. Treasury bills, has been lagging inflation, resulting in a negative return on an inflation-adjusted (or real) basis for many years. The surge in inflation over the past year has pushed the real return deep into negative territory, similar to where it was very briefly in both 1951 and 1980. Will a bull market return? A bull market is likely to return, as it typically has. But when? Well, every period is different and there can be no guarantees. It is worth noting however that the prior periods featuring any of these three bears were often very brief. Occurrences of cash bear market extremes historically marked a peak in inflation. We may already be seeing signs that inflation peaked last month, such as falling input prices and excess inventories reported last week at big box retailers like Target, Kohls, and Walmart (which we had projected in the November 2021 article Will Shortages Lead To Gluts?) Emergence of climbing global bond yields since 1980 have been consistently followed by some deflationary event that contained the rise: 1986 oil crash, 1989 fall of USSR, 1991 Japan going bust, 1998 Asian contagion, 2001 China joining the World Trade Organization, 2008 housing bust, 2011 Eurozone debt crisis, 2013 shale revolution, 2020 global pandemic. Perhaps another deflationary event may be just around the corner as risks of recession rise. Once stocks breached the 20% threshold, the time it took to reach their bottom before beginning a new bull market was often surprisingly short: 39 days in 1966; six days in 1987; 36 days in 1990; the same day in 1998; 12 days in 2011; the same day in 2018; and 11 days in 2020. The four exceptions to these brief periods were: the start of the 1970s when it took 117 days; the end of the inflation era in the early 1980s when it took 157 days; the early 2000s Tech Wreck where it took 595 days to bottom; and the 2008-09 Great Financial Crisis, which took 241 days. How much lower until the bottom? Nearly every stock bear market for the MSCI World Index came alongside a global economic recession. Non-U.S. stocks do not seem to have fully priced in a recession, but they may be close. The price-to-earnings (PE) ratio for international stocks, represented by the MSCI EAFE Index, has rarely been lower than it is today, outside of a recession. The history of analysts' estimates for the next 12 months of earnings begins in 1988, allowing us to look at nearly 35 years of the forward PE ratio. Currently, the forward PE for the MSCI EAFE Index of the stocks of international developed countries is well below its long-term average, but not yet in line with market lows associated with the prior seven recessions in Europe or Japan. On average, a recession would see the PE fall another 4%. During the two financing crises (Great Financial Crisis 2008-09 and European Debt Crisis 2011-13), forward PEs fell an additional 25-35%.

Past performance no guarantee of future results. Of course, a rapid decline in the earnings outlook for the next 12 months would tend to pull the PE ratio upwards, making equities more expensive. Fortunately, analysts have been raising rather than cutting estimates for earnings growth. In fact, the number of international companies with upward earnings revisions outpacing those with downward revisions has just reached the widest margin since before the war in Ukraine. Number of companies with upward and downward revisions back to pre-war levels Source: Charles Schwab, FactSet data as of 5/16/2022. Even as estimates of economic growth have been falling, estimates of earnings growth have been on the rise. It isn't because economists and analysts have different views, it's because they have different tasks. For example, higher energy prices can act as a drag on the economy, leading to lower GDP forecasts, but can boost the earnings outlook for the companies that make up the major indexes by lifting earnings for energy companies. Europe's earnings growth has been stronger than that of the U.S., aided by greater exposure to companies that benefit from higher inflation and commodity prices. Earnings growth for companies in the U.K., Canada, and Japan have been steadily rising and are now expected to be near 20% in 2022, up sharply from the start of the year. This compares to just about 10% earnings growth for the United States. Earnings growth is the main driver of the stock market over the intermediate and longer term, so this could be a plus for international companies. Goldilocks? Investors are worried that inflation is too hot and that the economy may be getting too cold. Investors looking for strategies that may be just right for them may want to consider these investing ideas: Managing volatility risk - We have been recommending maintaining strategic weights across asset classes and sectors, not because we don't have any ideas, but because diversification itself is an especially good idea right now in the current period of heightened volatility, which we foresee continuing. The correlation across stock markets has fallen to among the lowest levels in 20 years, magnifying the benefits of diversification. Managing inflation risk - Historically, when inflation expectations are rising, international stocks tend to outperform U.S. stocks. One reason is that international markets tend to be more inflation sensitive, with more companies that benefit from higher inflation than those that suffer. Managing rising interest rates - Shorter duration stocks can help manage the risk of rising rates. Stocks with more immediate cash flows, rather than cash flows in the distant future, have outperformed since rates bottomed in 2020, and tend to be more dominant in international markets. Managing downside risk - Companies around the world announcing new or increased stock buybacks seem to be outperforming than those that don't. Over the past decade, the biggest buyers of stocks have been the companies themselves, rather than individual investors.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I\\'m 61 and will be retiring next year. I’m trying to decide if it’s better to start taking Social Security right away, preserving my 401(k), or draw down my retirement account first and wait to claim Social Security until later? —A Reader Dear Reader, I love this question for several reasons. First, it uncovers an important and often overlooked feature about Social Security: when you retire and when you file for benefits are two important but distinct choices. You aren’t required to claim Social Security as soon as you retire. Second, as you point out, taking Social Security earlier rather than later can allow you to preserve your other retirement assets. However, you have to be careful here because your Social Security benefit is a guaranteed lifetime benefit by the U.S. government and has built-in inflation protection. Clearly that\\'s not the case with investments in the stock market. Evaluating one vs. the other isn\\'t an apples-to-apples comparison. And third, on average postponing filing for Social Security, thereby allowing your benefit to grow, is the better choice. One study has estimated that early filing costs the average household $111,000 over their lifetimes. Far too many people either don’t understand this, or simply succumb to the urge to “take the money and run,” filing at their first opportunity. That said, there\\'s no universal optimal way to balance the two. Every individual is different and the correct answer for you depends not only on all of your other sources of income (including your retirement accounts), but also many other factors such as your lifestyle, health, expectation of longevity, and desire to care for family members. In other words, you have to consider your complete financial and personal situation before you can determine how best to maximize both your savings and your Social Security benefit over the long term. Start with a few basic facts about Social Security Even though most people are eligible to collect Social Security at age 62, their benefit will continue to increase between 6 and 7 percent for every year they delay up to their \"full retirement age\" (FRA). Your FRA is between ages 66-67 depending on your birthday. After that, it will increase by 8 percent every year between FRA and age 70, at which time it maxes out. As a rough example, a monthly benefit of $1,000 at age 62 would increase to approximately $1,760 by age 70. In other words, if you file early, you’ll have extra income in your 60’s but your benefits will be permanently reduced. If you wait, you’ll likely enjoy a higher inflation-adjusted floor of income into your 70’s, 80’s, and possibly beyond. Then assess your current financial situation Conscientious retirement planning takes time and attention to detail. Most people will benefit from consulting a financial planner before they make a major decision such as the optimal time to file for Social Security. But whether you decide to work with a professional or not, you’ll need to start by having a complete up-to-date understanding of your total financial picture—including the amount and composition of the resources (pension, 401(k), IRA, brokerage accounts, part-time work, home equity, etc.) you can draw upon in retirement. This exercise is crucial because it will show you not only how much money you’ll be able to safely withdraw from your various accounts over your anticipated retirement, but also whether that amount is sufficient to support your lifestyle—and allow you to postpone filing for Social Security. Not all investments are the same Digging a little deeper, your asset allocation, investment holdings and drawdown strategy also come into play. The more conservative your investments, and the lower your expected rate of return, the more it may make sense to delay filing for Social Security. Conversely, the higher the expected rate of return of your investments, the more it may make sense to hold on to your investments and claim early. Of course, aggressive investments may or may not ultimately pay off, so you have to weigh the balance between risk and return and carefully assess your ability to withstand downturns. That being said, the situations in which delaying claiming Social Security works best—unexpected longevity, high inflation, and poor market returns—are the same scenarios in which many investments tend to struggle, and why Social Security is better viewed as a form of insurance than an investment. Think about your health and family Another important factor is your health and anticipated longevity. Clearly the longer you live, and the more years you have to collect a higher benefit, the more sense it makes to delay filing for Social Security. On the other hand, if you\\'re in poor health, you may be wise to take benefits earlier. Also consider your family. Once you file, your spouse age 62 or older and dependent children under age 18 may also qualify to receive a portion of your Social Security benefit based on your record. If you predecease your spouse, they\\'re eligible to collect on your Social Security benefit. In this case, delaying filing will typically provide a larger benefit for your survivors. Put the pieces together As you can see, finding the optimal time to file for Social Security is a complex decision. To summarize, here are a few things to think about: Consider delaying if you can afford to wait and if you\\'re in good health and anticipate a long life. Consider claiming early if you don’t have the financial resources to wait, or if you anticipate shorter than average longevity. Factor in the expected return of your asset allocation, your appetite for investment risk and desire for guaranteed income. Be mindful of how your timing can impact spousal and family benefits. A crucial decision There\\'s no question that retirement can be one of the most fulfilling times in our lives. But at the same time, making sure you have the financial security to enjoy these years requires a lot of thought and preparation. So take your time. You don’t have to file for Social Security right away. Instead, talk to a financial planner who can help you integrate Social Security into your retirement plan, examining various “what if’s” and the impact of different claiming and withdrawal strategies.

       "   'content': 'After years of low nominal and negative real interest rates, markets are resetting for an era of higher inflation. Major central banks are hiking interest rates rapidly and shrinking their balance sheets in an effort to \"normalize\" policy. The question hanging over the market is, \"What is a normal policy rate?\" The Federal Reserve estimates that the \"neutral rate\"—one that is neither too restrictive nor too easy—is around 2.0% to 2.5%. However, markets are uneasy that high inflation will mean that the Fed needs to exceed this rate, and have priced in a federal funds rate as high as 3% by mid-2023. What comes next? Yields jump as inflation rises Given the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, inflation expectations have jumped. Supply-chain disruptions, shortages of basic commodities, and sanctions have limited supplies of goods, while demand has rebounded thanks to stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies. The burst of inflation stemming from these factors caught central banks by surprise and they are scrambling to get ahead of it. Meanwhile, markets are struggling to figure out what a logical policy rate should be in a world where inflation is at its highest levels in decades, but global growth prospects are dimming. Global 2-year yields are rising Source: Bloomberg. U.S. (USGG10YR Index), Germany (GTDEM2Y Index), Italy (GTIT2Y Index), Greece (GTGRD2Y Index), U.K. (GTGBP2Y Index), Canada (GTCAD2Y Index). Daily data as of 10:33 a.m. ET 5/12/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Are we there yet? There is an old saying that \"The Fed tends to tighten policy until something breaks.\" In other words, rising interest rates eventually cause the economy to falter, generally causing the most-leveraged, weakest sectors of the markets to fall. Since the Fed started signaling its intention to tighten policy at the December 2021 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, there have been signs of cracks. However, so far, the economy has been resilient. In our view, now that nominal yields1 are back at pre-pandemic levels seen in 2018, we believe that much of the rise in yields for the cycle is likely behind us. However, there are several other market indicators we are monitoring to confirm a cycle top in rates. 1. Real yields: Although nominal yields have rebounded sharply, real yields (adjusted for inflation) have just begun to move into positive territory after holding in negative territory for two years. At about 0.25%, 10-year real yields are about half the level that prevailed during the last period when the Fed was trying to normalize policy, from mid-2013 to 2019. It\\'s worth noting that higher real yields do not necessarily require higher nominal yields. It\\'s the difference between nominal yields and inflation expectations that determines real yields. Therefore it’s possible that real yields will rise if inflation expectations edge lower. However, with the inflation picture so volatile, this indicator is still making us cautious. Real 10-year yield: 2013-2019 Source: Bloomberg. US Generic Govt TII 10 Yr (USGGT10Y INDEX). Daily data from 6/1/2013 to 6/1/2019. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. In fact, inflation expectations embedded in the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) market—the breakeven rate—recently have fallen sharply as the market begins to price in a slowdown in economic activity and inflation longer term. Market inflation expectations have fallen sharply Source: Bloomberg. U.S. Breakeven 10 Year (USGGBE10 Index) and U.S. Breakeven 5 Year (USGGBE05 Index). Daily data as of 10:34 a.m. ET 5/12/2022. The breakeven rate is the difference between the TIPS rate and the comparable-maturity Treasury rate, and is used as a gauge for what market participants believe inflation will be five or 10 years in the future. 2. Yield curve: The yield curve—the difference between short-term and longer-term yields—has a long history of providing signals on the level and direction of rates. Historically, an inverted yield curve (where longer-term rates are lower than short-term rates) has been a reliable indicator of rising recession risk, while a steep yield curve is associated with stronger growth. Currently, the yield curve is still positively sloped, but it is likely to flatten as the Fed hikes short-term interest rates. At past cyclical peaks, yields have tended to converge, resulting in a flat curve. Currently, the curve is still steep at the short end but if the Fed follows through on its plans to raise the fed funds rate rapidly this year, the flattening could signal an approaching peak in rates. In past cycles, 10-year yields and the federal funds rate have converged near market peaks Source: Bloomberg. Effective Federal Funds Rate, (FEDL01 Index) and 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate, Percent, Monthly, Not Seasonally Adjusted (USGG10YR Index). Data as of 10:36 a.m. ET 5/12/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 3. Credit spreads: Credit spreads have begun to rise, especially for the riskiest bond issuers. However, the rise has only brought spreads back to longer-term average levels. They aren\\'t yet at levels that suggest a significant rise in defaults among companies borrowing in the corporate bond market. However, the steepness of the rise in interest costs will likely weigh on the credit quality of the weakest issuers, like those in the HY market. HY spreads have historically risen most sharply later in an economic cycle, but we are watching the trend for signs that rising rates are slowing economic activity. High-yield spreads have risen sharply Source: Bloomberg, using daily data as of 10:38 ET 5/12/2022. Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index (LF98TRUU Index). OAS is a method used in calculating the relative value of a fixed income security containing an embedded option, such as a borrower\\'s option to prepay a loan. 4. The dollar: The U.S. dollar has risen also sharply in recent months, reflecting the relative strength of the U.S. economy compared to other major countries, widening interest rate differentials, and a degree of safe-haven buying as a result of global political turmoil. Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index remains firm Source: Bloomberg. Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index (BBDXY Index). Daily data as of 10:41 a.m. ET 5/12/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. A strong dollar tends to be helpful in holding down domestic inflation, but because many globally traded goods are priced in U.S. dollars, it can contribute to inflation abroad as the purchasing power of other countries falls. Emerging-market (EM) countries, which require U.S. dollar reserves, tend to see the most negative impact on inflation and growth. The recent surge in the dollar may be reaching a level where it is destabilizing for some EM countries with large amounts of U.S. dollar-denominated debt. The Fed doesn\\'t explicitly target a level for the dollar, but it does take the impact on the economy into consideration. If the dollar continues higher, it may lead the Fed to dial back its rate-hike plans. What investors can consider now There is a risk that yields rebound near-term until there are clear signs that inflation pressures are beginning to ebb in response to tightening monetary policy by major central banks. The Fed has indicated that its estimate of the neutral rate is around 2.0% to 2.5% but hasn’t ruled out exceeding that level if inflation doesn\\'t ease. While we believe that it is likely that the worst of the jump in yields is behind us, calling a cyclical peak is difficult due to the myriad forces driving the markets. As a result, we\\'re monitoring the factors mentioned above. In the meantime, we suggest investors consider gradually adding some duration to portfolios with high-credit-quality bonds, such as Treasuries and investment-grade municipal and corporate bonds. Income-oriented investors can find yields that are now back at pre-pandemic levels, sometimes in bonds trading below par. That can offer the opportunity to invest for both income and potential total return. 1 \"Nominal yield\" refers to the interest rate (or \"coupon rate\") that a bond issuer promises to pay bond purchasers. The \"real yield\" is the nominal yield adjusted to remove the effects of inflation and reflects the real cost of funds to the borrower.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'What are your options for topping up your account after a position drops?',\n",
       "   'content': 'As markets grew volatile this year, you may have found yourself fielding a request from your brokerage to top up your margin account. As if falling stock prices weren\\'t bad enough, suddenly you\\'re being asked to either pour more money or securities into your account or sell stock to bring your account back up to the minimum maintenance level. What\\'s the smartest way to proceed? The first thing to acknowledge is that margin calls come with the territory. If you\\'re going to trade with borrowed money in the hope of boosting your profits, you also have to accept the possibility that an investment won’t work out and you\\'ll have to cover a margin call. Here we\\'ll review how margin calls work, some options for responding to them, and tips for how to approach future trades so you can better manage your risk. What\\'s in a margin call? When you buy stocks on margin or have a margin loan, you must maintain a certain percentage of \"equity\" in your account—known as the margin requirement—to serve as collateral. This just means you will always have to have some skin in the game, whether in the form of cash or securities you\\'ve deposited in the account. The size of the margin requirement varies by security. For many marginable stocks, it\\'s 30% of the value of your position, but you could also see requirements of 75% or even 100%. Generally, the higher the requirement, the less valuable it is for collateral purposes, as we’ll see below. (Some securities, such as penny stocks or IPO shares, are considered nonmarginable, and so won\\'t affect your calculations.) If your margin account holds multiple securities with different margin requirements, as is common, your account’s overall margin requirement will be equal to sum of your various securities\\' individual requirements. The wrinkle with margin, of course, is that while the value of your collateral fluctuates with the market, the amount you borrowed stays the same, assuming you don\\'t close out the account and repay your loan. If the value of the stocks you\\'re using as collateral falls, so does the ratio of your equity relative to your margin debt. (Sometimes your securities don\\'t even have to fall to hurt your equity in the account. If your brokerage decides to change a security\\'s margin requirement, you could come up short regardless of what the market\\'s doing.) If your equity ratio falls below the minimum, your brokerage will issue a margin call, and you will be required to bring your equity back up to the required level. Meeting a margin call You have a few ways to respond to a margin call. But not all responses are the same in terms of the credit you gain against the call—some give you much more bang for your buck than others. This matters because you don\\'t want to transfer—or dump—what seems like a lot of stock to boost your equity, only to discover that you still haven\\'t met the call. In fact, it often makes sense to do more than the minimum as further declines in the market could lead to additional margin calls. Before we get into the responses, though, we’ll need an example portfolio: Assume you\\'ve got $5,000 of cash and buy $5,000 stocks on margin. Your portfolio holds: $5,000 of Stock XYZ, which has a 30% margin requirement ($5,000*0.3=$1,500) $3,000 of Stock ABC, which has a 75% margin requirement ($3,000*0.75=$2,250) $2,000 of Stock XXX, which is nonmarginable. (That means no margin requirement, but XXX doesn’t count toward your equity.) That gives you an overall position amounting to $10,000, including $2,000 of nonmarginable stock. The $5,000 of cash you put in to open the position is your equity, and the margin requirement for your $8,000 of marginable stock comes to $3,750 ($1,500+$2,250). So far, so good. Starting position Starting portfolio value $10,000 Margin debt $5,000 Margin equity $5,000 Full account margin requirement $1,500+$2,250 = $3,750 Then volatility strikes, leaving all three of your stocks down from where you bought them. Now you hold: $4,500 of Stock XYZ, which has a 30% margin requirement ($2,000*0.3=$1,350) $1,500 of Stock ABC, which has a 75% margin requirement ($3,000*0.75=$1,125) $1,000 of Stock XXX, which is nonmarginable. That means you now have marginable stock worth $6,000 ($4,500+$1,500), with a margin requirement of $2,475 ($1,350+$1,125). However, your $5,000 of margin debt hasn\\'t changed, so instead of $5,000 of equity, you now have just $1,000 ($6,000-$5,000)—$1,475 short of the margin requirement. Position after fall Portfolio value after stocks fall $7,000 Margin debt $5,000 Margin equity $1,000 Full account margin requirement $1,350+$1,125 = $2,475 Margin call $1,475 What\\'s the most efficient way to get to $1,475? In order of desirability, here are some options: Deposit cash. Every dollar in cash you place in your margin account counts as $1 of equity. Notice, however, that injecting cash doesn\\'t increase the value of your account or lower the margin balance. Amount: $1,475 Deposit cash Margin call $1,475 Deposit cash $1,475 Margin balance $5,000 Equity $2,475 Shortfall $0 Portfolio value $7,000 Sell nonmarginable securities. Selling your nonmarginable securities (like Stock XXX) will also free up cash on a dollar-for-dollar basis. However, in our example, we don\\'t have enough Stock XXX to cover the full margin call. That means we\\'ll have to make up the difference with cash. Amount: $1,000 + $475 of cash Sell nonmarginable securities Margin call $1,475 Sell nonmarginable securities $1,000 Deposit cash to make up the difference $475 Margin balance $5,000 Equity $2,475 Shortfall $0 Account value $6,000 Deposit marginable securities. Transferring more marginable securities to your margin account will effectively boost the total value of your position—and your equity—relative to the size of your margin debt. But be aware that the value of your deposit will end up being larger than your margin call because it will effectively be discounted by the securities\\' maintenance requirement—so, the lower the maintenance requirement the better. (Why? Lower margin requirement securities boost your buying power with a smaller commitment of collateral than higher margin requirement securities.) Here is the equation you will use: amount of margin call / (1 - maintenance requirement %). For example, if you deposit more Stock XYZ, which has a 30% maintenance requirement: Amount: $1,475 / (1 – 0.3) = $2,107.14 Deposit margin securities Margin call $1,475 Deposit 30% marginable securities $1,475 / (1 – 0.3) Deposit value $2,107.14 Margin balance $5,000 Equity $3,107 Shortfall $0 Account value $9,107 New maintenance requirement $3,107 As you can see, depositing securities increases your equity and the total value of your margin portfolio. Your portfolio is now worth $9,107.14, of which $3,107.14 is your equity. But there\\'s a kicker: Your account\\'s margin requirement is also now $3,107.14. What if you decided to deposit more of Stock ABC, with its 75% maintenance requirement instead? Your deposit would have to be more than three times larger: Amount: $1,475 / 1 – 0.75 = $5,900 Sell marginable securities. Rather than boosting the size of your position relative to your debt, you could shrink your debt by selling marginable securities. Again, the amount you sell will have to be larger than the size of your margin call because of the maintenance requirement discount—but this time, the higher the maintenance requirement the better. (Why? Because you\\'re required to carry a bigger stake in such securities, you get more credit when you sell them.) Here is the equation: amount of margin call / maintenance requirement of security being liquidated. For example, if you sell Stock ABC, which has a 75% maintenance requirement: Amount: $1,475 / 0.75 = $1,966.67 Because we have only $1,500 of Stock ABC, we’ll have to make up the difference with $466.67 of cash. Sell marginable Margin call $1,475 Sell 75% marginable securities $1,475/0.75 Proceeds from stock sale $1,500 Deposit cash $466.67 Shortfall $0 Margin debt $3,500 Equity $1,466.67 Account value $5,500 New margin requirement $1,350 As you can see, selling marginable securities decreases your debt, while the cash injection boosts your equity. Your portfolio is now worth $5,550, of which $1,466.67 is your equity stake. What if you decided to sell Stock XYZ, with its 30% maintenance requirement instead? You would have to sell more than twice as much stock and still deposit cash: Amount: $1,475 / 0.3 = $4,916.67 Plus $416.67 cash Tax considerations When you receive a margin call, your priority should be meeting it as efficiently as possible. However, don\\'t forget that selling securities can also have tax consequences. For example, any gains on stocks, bonds, or mutual funds you\\'ve held for less than a year will be taxed at your federal income tax rate, while gains on assets you\\'ve held for a year or more will be taxed at a maximum federal long-term capital gains rate of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. On the other hand, if you sell a losing investment, you can use that loss to offset gains you may have realized in your taxable accounts over the course of the year, which can help reduce your tax liability—a strategy known as tax-loss harvesting. Even if you have no gains to counteract, you can still use your losses to offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income per tax year until all your losses have been accounted for.

Carrying on If receiving and meeting a margin call proved to be too harrowing for your taste, here some ideas to consider for managing your risk in the future. Clip your wings. Borrow less than the maximum amount allowable in your account. You can also maintain an equity level for yourself that is higher than your brokerage\\'s requirements—say, 50% when your brokerage is asking for 30%—and monitor your portfolio to ensure you don\\'t go below that level. Diversify your portfolio. This can help lower the risk that a single security\\'s drop in value will trigger a margin call. Watch more closely. Be aware of what is going on in the market. Recognize that margin comes with increased risk, and consistently reassess your risk tolerance. Anticipate a potential decline in value, especially during uncertain or volatile market conditions. Have a plan. Develop a risk-management strategy for your investments that is consistent with your market outlook and stick to it. At the same time, have contingency plans for dealing with potential margin calls, including a repayment plan just in case the market turns. Finally, it\\'s worth noting that even if you haven\\'t received a margin call, it\\'s probably best to use margin infrequently and for a limited amount of time. Margin can help boost your gains on winning trades, but because you must pay interest, you should think of it as expense, albeit one that is tax-deductible if you itemize and use the funds to purchase securities.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'With interest rates and inflation rising in tandem, you might be wondering how to get the most out of the cash you hold. Rising interest rates have started to offer better yields on the cash you can invest, even as inflation erodes your long-term purchasing power. So, where\\'s the smart place to keep your cash? It depends on how you plan to use it. Should you have cash in your investment portfolio? Schwab believes that cash can be a key component of a diversified investment portfolio, helping to reduce portfolio risk, provide stability, and generate yield on the money you need for specific goals like establishing an emergency fund or making a down-payment on a house. There are a few options to consider for savings and investment cash: A yield-bearing savings account can be used for cash that you\\'ve set aside for an emergency or that you\\'re planning on moving to a checking account soon. This type of account probably won\\'t offer the highest yield, but you\\'ll be able to access your cash immediately. Savings accounts are insured by the FDIC against the loss of your money up to $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, based on account ownership type. A purchased money fund is a type of mutual fund designed to keep your capital stable and liquid. Such funds invest primarily in high-quality, short-term debt securities. If you\\'re willing to wait a day to access your cash1, you might consider making money funds part of your portfolio because they can offer higher yields than a savings account. Although yields fluctuate, such funds strive to preserve the value of your investment. That said, money funds are not FDIC-insured. A Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a type of savings account issued by a bank that offers you a fixed rate of return in exchange for locking away your funds for a set period of time (the \"maturity date\"), generally between 3 months and 5 years. CDs may be appropriate if you have a long time horizon or know you won\\'t need the money immediately. As a rule, the yield on a CD is higher the longer your money is invested and is typically (but not always) higher than yields on individual U.S. Treasury bonds or purchased money funds. However, if you need to withdraw the money sooner than expected, you may be charged an early withdrawal penalty and you may receive back less than the premium at maturity. CDs are insured by the FDIC against the loss of your money up to $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank. Should you have cash outside your investment portfolio—and if so, where do you put it? You\\'ll need a place to keep so-called \"everyday cash\"—the money you use for day-to-day expenses and paying bills. Two account types offer easy access to everyday cash: A checking account can help cover daily spending needs, check-writing, and ATM usage. Bank checking accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an independent agency of the US government, against the loss of up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, based on account ownership type. A brokerage account. Uninvested cash from this type of account earns interest and is available for investing or managing expenses. Holding cash here is appropriate if you plan to spend the money within a few days or would like to quickly place a trade. Assets in your brokerage account are protected up to $500,000 per investor, including a maximum of $250,000 in cash, by Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), in the event a SIPC-member brokerage fails. When you\\'re deciding where to hold your cash, ease of access, insurance, and yield all figure into the picture. For near-term use, accessibility will be a big consideration, while cash for long-term use has the potential to earn higher returns. However you deploy your cash, be sure to revisit your decisions as your plans and goals change. 1If you sell your shares by 4 p.m. Eastern time, you\\'ll have next-day access to funds.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Older workers with earned income—including those who’ve already started taking required minimum distributions (RMDs)1 at age 72—can make contributions to tax-deferred traditional IRA accounts. But does it make sense to do so? \"Under the right circumstances, contributing to an IRA as an older worker can complement your tax strategy,\" says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. For example, contributing could make sense if you want to: 1. Lower your taxable income If you earn less than $78,000 in 2022 ($129,000 if married) or don\\'t have access to a workplace retirement plan, you may be able to deduct traditional IRA contributions, thereby reducing your taxable income for the year (up to the annual contribution limit of $7,000 for those ages 50 and older). If your deductible contributions reduce your income to less than $25,000 ($32,000 if married), you can even avoid having your Social Security benefits taxed. (Admittedly, this is quite a low ceiling and may not be possible for retirees with significant savings.) 2. Benefit from a lower tax bracket in retirement Making tax-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA now, if eligible, allows you to defer paying taxes until you’re in a potentially lower tax bracket in retirement. This could be especially advantageous for workers who expect to retire in the next few years and want to beef up their savings before they leave the workforce. 3. Perform a backdoor Roth conversion If your income exceeds Roth IRA contribution limits—$144,000 for individuals in 2022, $214,000 if married—you may be able to make after-tax contributions to a traditional IRA and then convert the funds to a Roth IRA.2 \"Once you\\'re 59½ or older and have held the account for five years, you can withdraw contributions and earnings from a Roth totally tax-free,\" Hayden says. \"Plus, such accounts aren\\'t subject to RMDs.\" \"Older workers have a fair number of saving options now,\" Hayden continues, \"so it\\'s wise to work with a financial planner or tax professional to determine how best to achieve your retirement goals.\" 1 Required minimum distributions (RMDs) must be taken each year beginning with the year you turn age 72 (70½ if you turn 70½ in 2019). 2 The IRS\\' pro rata rule requires that you include all your IRA assets—meaning those funded with pretax (deductible) contributions and those funded with after-tax (nondeductible) contributions—when calculating the conversion\\'s taxes.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Prices are always moving in financial markets. This is a good thing: You couldn\\'t make money as a trader if prices never changed. Sometimes prices move more quickly than at other times. The speed or degree of the price change (in either direction) is called volatility. As volatility increases, the potential to make more money quickly, also increases. The tradeoff is that higher volatility also means higher risk. When volatility spikes, it may be possible to generate above-average profits, but you also run the risk of losing a larger amount of capital in a relatively shorter period of time. If you\\'re disciplined, you may be able to take advantage of volatility—while minimizing risks. Here are four steps to consider when trading in volatile markets. 1. Define your objectives and bolster your defenses Before attempting to trade in volatile markets, be sure you are mentally and tactically prepared to manage the increased risks involved. That means: You\\'re comfortable trading when volatility is high. You recognize the potential for significant loss of capital. Assuming you\\'re \"ready for action,\" the next thing to do is double check the risk-control measures included in your trading plan. Two important considerations are position size and stop order placement. (As a reminder: Stop orders can help protect an unrealized gain or limit potential losses on an existing position by allowing you to set price triggers for stock sales.) During volatile markets, some traders place smaller trades—meaning, they commit less capital per trade—and set their stop prices further from the current market price than they would in calmer times. The goal is to keep your overall risk exposure about the same, while lowering the chances you\\'ll be prematurely stopped out due to wider-than-normal intraday price fluctuations. As always, remember that stop orders can be executed far from the stop price during a big price gap or during rapidly changing market conditions. 2. Focus on trending stocks Market volatility doesn\\'t necessarily erase trends. Certain stocks may continue to move in a particular direction—albeit with a potentially higher degree of risk. For a buyer, the key is to find a stock that\\'s been trending higher at a steady pace but hasn\\'t yet rocketed upward. The goal is to get in before a price acceleration, not after. Likewise, a short seller trading in a volatile market should look for a stock that\\'s been declining but hasn\\'t yet experienced a collapse or \"waterfall\" decline. 3. Watch for breakouts from consolidations Traders often try to \"buy the breakout\"—that is, waiting for a stock to move through an identifiable support and resistance range. Support is the price level where downward trends tend to weaken as buying pressure overcomes selling pressure. Resistance is often where upward trends start to fizzle as selling pressure overcomes buying pressure. As long as a stock remains within that range, the breakout trader does nothing. However, if the price breaks through the resistance level, the trader will look to buy immediately in hopes that the breakout signals the beginning of a new sustained move upward. 4. Consider taking some profits In volatile markets, profits can suddenly vanish and turn into losses, so consider ways to lock in more gains when you can. One approach here would be to lower the profit target for parts of your positions. Or if your stock is moving sharply higher, consider selling a portion of your position, while letting the remainder ride to capture any further gains. If you\\'re more concerned about protecting your profits than you are about potentially getting stopped out, consider using a trailing stop—a kind of stop order where the stop price trails the stock\\'s bid price as it moves higher—but set a tighter-than-normal trailing stop price. Remember, the trailing stop price essentially self-adjusts and remains below the market price by the number of points or the percentage that you specify, as long as the stock is moving higher. Once the stock begins to move lower, the stop price freezes at the highest level it reaches. Then when it triggers, it becomes a market order. Be prepared Traders crave price movement because of the potential opportunity to make bigger profits. But there\\'s always a risk prices will move more quickly than they’re used to. In such markets, it may be worth it to pay closer attention than usual and change tactics accordingly. But don\\'t try to do this in the heat of the moment. The key is to prepare in advance. If you\\'re not sure where the markets are heading, just sitting on the sidelines isn\\'t a bad idea. Periods of heightened volatility come and go and tend to be short-lived. Sometimes, the best trade to make may be no trade at all.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Taxes are such a normal part of life that people may overlook them until it\\'s time to file their returns. Unfortunately, by that point it may be too late to implement an efficient investment strategy for minimizing their tax bill. Returns lost to taxes When it comes to investing, it\\'s not just how much you make that matters—it\\'s how much you keep after taxes. The amount lost to taxes and other costs is one of the key factors affecting your returns, according to the Schwab Center for Financial Research, just behind proper investment selection and asset allocation. Even small amounts can quickly add up to a lot over the years, so anything you can do to reduce the drag will help. The good news is you can exercise a good deal of control here. With a bit of planning, you can make your portfolio more tax-efficient and hold on to more of your returns. How do I maximize tax efficiency? A big part of tax efficiency is putting the right investment in the right account. Investment accounts can be divided into two main categories: Taxable accounts, such as brokerage accounts, are good candidates for investments that tend to lose less of their returns to taxes. Tax-advantaged accounts, such as an IRA, 401(k), or Roth IRA, are generally a better home for investments that lose more of their returns to taxes. What does that mean in practical terms? Here we\\'ve matched some common kinds of investments with taxable or tax-advantaged accounts: Where tax-smart investors typically place their investments *Such as Roth IRAs and tax-deferred accounts including traditional IRAs, 401(k)s and deferred annuities. Of course, this presumes that you hold investments in both types of accounts. If all your investment money is in your 401(k) or IRA, then just focus on picking appropriate investments and allocating to them according to your goals, risk tolerance and timeframe. Diversifying by tax treatment Holding your investments in the most tax-appropriate type of account can complement your savings plans by helping to reduce taxes (or, in the case of a Roth, eliminate entirely the taxes on investment returns).1 Spreading your investments across accounts with different tax treatments can also give you more flexibility in managing your taxes when you start drawing from your savings in retirement. Call it \"tax diversification.\" Diversifying by tax treatment can be especially important if you’re uncertain about the tax bracket you\\'ll end up in down the road. For example, by investing in a taxable brokerage account, and then splitting your retirement-savings contributions between a tax-deferred IRA or 401(k) and an after-tax Roth account, you would have more options for managing your income in retirement, regardless of your tax bracket. So, if your goal was to minimize your overall tax burden, you could focus on taking tax-free municipal bond income, qualified dividends, and long-term capital gains (which currently tend to be taxed at lower rates) from your taxable accounts and tax-free income from your Roth accounts. Then you could take only enough money from your taxable IRA or 401(k) to cover your spending needs or satisfy required minimum distributions, if applicable. Of course, this is just one approach. Some investors may prefer to rely on their taxable and tax-deferred accounts (along with Social Security and pensions) for income, and leave their tax-free Roth savings to continue growing for as long as possible. Making strategic use of your different accounts according to their tax treatment can also help you plan your charitable giving and estate planning goals—different accounts receive different types of gift and estate tax treatment. For example, you might want to give appreciated securities from your taxable accounts to charity for a full fair market value deduction and no capital gains tax. You can also leave such shares to your heirs who will receive a step-up in cost basis after you\\'re gone (more on that below). Roth IRAs also make a great bequest, as distributions are free from income tax for your beneficiaries. However you decide to split up your portfolio between account types, remember that for asset allocation purposes, you should still think of all your investments as being part of a single portfolio. By way of an oversimplified illustration: If you kept all your stocks in your taxable account and an equal amount of money in bonds in your tax-advantaged account, you wouldn\\'t have two portfolios consisting of 100% stocks and 100% bonds. You would have one portfolio consisting of 50% stocks and 50% bonds. The different assets just happen to be in different accounts. Other tax-related investment considerations In general, holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts should have the potential to add value over time. However, there are other factors to consider, including: Periodically rebalancing your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation. Rebalancing involves selling and buying assets that have either grown beyond or fallen below your original allocation. When you take profits from your winners and buy assets that have underperformed, it could cause an additional tax drag on returns in your taxable accounts. You may also incur either long- or short-term capital gains when you take profits from assets that have grown. You may want to focus your rebalancing efforts on your tax-advantaged accounts and include your taxable accounts only when necessary. Adding new money to underweighted asset classes is also a tax-efficient way to help keep your portfolio allocation in balance. Active trading by individuals or by mutual funds, when successful, tends to be less tax-efficient and better suited for tax-advantaged accounts. A caveat: Realized losses in your tax-advantaged accounts can’t be used to offset realized gains on your tax return through a process known as tax-loss harvesting. A preference for income might prompt you to hold bonds in taxable accounts, even if it makes more sense from a tax perspective to hold them in tax-advantaged accounts. In other situations, it may be impractical to implement all of your portfolio\\'s fixed income allocation using taxable bonds in tax-advantaged accounts. If so, compare the after-tax return on taxable bonds to the tax-exempt return on municipal bonds to see which makes the most sense on an after-tax basis. Estate planning issues and philanthropic intent might play a role in your portfolio planning. If you\\'re thinking about leaving stocks to your heirs, stocks in taxable accounts are generally preferable. That’s because the cost basis is calculated based on the market value of the stocks at the time of death (rather than at the time they were originally acquired, when they may have been worth substantially less). In contrast, stocks in tax-deferred accounts don\\'t receive this treatment since distributions are taxed as ordinary income anyway. Additionally, highly appreciated stocks held in taxable accounts for more than a year might be well-suited for charitable giving because you’ll get a bigger deduction. The charity also gets a bigger donation than if you liquidate the stock and pay long-term capital gains tax before donating the proceeds. The Roth IRA might be an exception to the general rules of thumb discussed above. Because qualified distributions are tax free, assets you believe will have the greatest potential for higher return are best placed inside a Roth IRA, when possible. Keep more of your money with tax-efficient investments If you want to keep more of your income, managing your investments with tax efficiency in mind is a must. What\\'s more, tax efficient investing techniques are accessible to almost everyone—it just takes some planning to reap the benefits. 1 If you take a distribution of Roth IRA earnings before you reach age 59½ or before the account is five years old, the earnings may be subject to taxes and penalties.'}],\n",

Failure to do so means getting hit with a 50% penalty on the difference between what you withdrew and what was required. \"Because of the penalty, RMDs should be your first stop when tapping your retirement portfolio,\" Hayden says. (Most financial institutions—including Schwab—can help calculate your RMDs when the time comes, or you can estimate them ahead of time using an online calculator.) Whatever you withdraw will be taxed as ordinary income, so if you don\\'t need this money to cover your living expenses, consider depositing it into a taxable brokerage account, where you could potentially put it back to work in the market. Step 2: Tap interest and dividends Next, withdraw the interest and dividends—but not the original investment—from your taxable accounts. \"Leaving the original investment untouched means it can continue to grow and potentially yield more dividends and/or interest in the future,\" Hayden says. Interest is taxed as ordinary income—unless it\\'s from a tax-free municipal bond or municipal bond fund. Dividends, on the other hand, are often taxed at the lower capital gains rate of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on income level—provided certain requirements, such as minimum holding periods, are met. Step 3: Collect principal from maturing bonds and CDs Many retirees rely on bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs) to generate regular income. Laddering such investments—that is, buying bonds and/or CDs with staggered maturity dates and reinvesting the principal as each comes due—can help provide a steady stream of income from interest payments while evening out your portfolio’s yields over time. However, should you still need cash after exhausting RMDs (if you\\'re of age) and your interest and dividends, the principal from a maturing bond or CD is often the next place to turn. Generally speaking, you won\\'t owe any taxes on your original principal, so long as you hold on to a bond or CD until its maturity date; an early sale will trigger capital gains taxes if you earn a profit on the sale. Step 4: Sell additional assets as needed If the income generated from Steps 1 through 3 isn\\'t enough to cover your expenses, you\\'ll need to sell additional assets to close the gap. But which accounts should you tap first—and in what proportion? If you have modest tax-deferred savings or your RMDs aren\\'t likely to push you into a higher tax bracket, depleting your taxable brokerage accounts first leaves your tax-deferred assets to potentially grow until RMDs kick in. To tap your taxable accounts most efficiently: First, part with investments that have lost value. Your losses can be used to offset any gains you may realize—a strategy known as tax-loss harvesting (see \"Using a tax loss to get a tax break,\" below). \"And if you don\\'t realize any capital gains, you can use those losses to offset up to $3,000 of your ordinary income per year until all your losses have been used up,\" Hayden says. Just be sure you don’t violate the wash-sale rule by repurchasing the same or \"substantially identical\" securities within 30 days before or after the sale, lest your losses be disallowed. Next, focus on selling investments you\\'ve held for more than a year to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates. You can sell these appreciated investments as part of your regular portfolio rebalancing, using whatever\\'s necessary to meet your spending needs and reinvesting the remainder in underweight areas of your portfolio. If you have significant tax-deferred savings, it\\'s possible that your RMDs could push you into a higher tax bracket once they kick in, especially after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. If you suspect this could be the case, you may want to consider drawing down your tax-deferred accounts and your taxable savings at the same time. With this approach, you take withdrawals from both your tax-deferred and taxable accounts in amounts proportionate to their balances. For example, say you have $800,000 in a traditional IRA and $200,000 in a brokerage account for a total of $1 million in savings. If you require $50,000 from your portfolio to fund your spending, you’d take $40,000 (80%) from your tax-deferred IRA and $10,000 (20%) from your taxable brokerage account using the tax-efficient withdrawal strategy mentioned above. \"This strategy can help smooth out the potential spike in income caused by RMDs, which may reduce your total taxes paid in retirement,\" Hayden says. Distributions from your tax-deferred accounts will be taxed as ordinary income, so the order in which you sell them doesn\\'t matter from a tax perspective; however, you should still draw them down in a way that maintains your target asset allocation. Using a tax loss to get a tax break A hypothetical investor who realized $20,000 in short-term capital gains and has $25,000 in unrealized capital losses, could use tax-loss harvesting to cut down her tax bill. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Assumes a 32% combined federal/state marginal income tax bracket, with short-term capital gains taxed at the ordinary income tax rates. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to represent a specific investment product and the example does not reflect the effects of fees. Step 5: Save Roth accounts for last \"Generally, it\\'s in your interest to hold off on tapping Roth assets for as long as possible,\" Hayden says. That\\'s because: Withdrawals are entirely tax-free starting at age 59½, provided you\\'ve held the account for at least five years. Roth IRAs aren\\'t subject to RMDs—you can leave these assets to grow indefinitely during your lifetime. Withdrawals are also tax-free for your heirs. \"The laws could always change, but at least for now it’s one of the best assets you can pass on to the next generation,\" Hayden says. Unlike Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s are subject to RMDs—which is why it might make sense for some people to roll over any existing Roth 401(k) accounts into a Roth IRA. Be aware, however, that converting a Roth 401(k) to a Roth IRA could reset the five-year holding requirement—unless funds are rolled into an existing Roth IRA, in which case they benefit from the holding period on that account. If you\\'re considering a rollover, it’s best to check with a financial advisor before you decide. Get help if you need it While some retirees enjoy actively managing their investments, others might not want to get bogged down in the intricacies of handling their withdrawals and taxes. \"Determining which assets to sell can be complex, and some savers would really benefit from working with a financial advisor, a tax professional, or an automated robo-advisor,\" Hayden says (see \"Creating tax-smart withdrawals during retirement,\" below). \"Either way, managing your tax liability can be an effective way to help keep more money in your pocket and potentially extend the life of your savings.\" Creating tax-smart withdrawals during retirement Schwab Intelligent Income™—a feature of Schwab Intelligent Portfolios®—is an automated investing solution that generates a predictable, tax-smart, monthly paycheck from your investments.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I’ve gotten so used to low interest rates that I’m not sure what to expect when they start to rise. I have both investment and savings accounts plus a mortgage and a little bit of credit card debt. Can you explain why this is happening, and what, if anything, I should do about it? —A Reader Dear Reader, Thanks for this question that's top of mind for so many people. And it’s no wonder—borrowers and investors have been in an unusually low interest rate environment for more years than they might remember. By way of background, the Fed has indicated that they will gradually increase the federal funds rate (the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans, which has effectively been at zero for years) over the coming months with the first hikes occurring this past March and May. Their goal is straightforward: to control inflation, currently at a 40-year high. The theory is that by raising rates, they cool down the economy by slowing demand for goods and services, which in turn slows down price increases. This works because the fed funds rate also determines a variety of other short-term rates that impact our daily finances; for example, interest on bank deposits, loans, credit cards and adjustable-rate mortgages. And ultimately it will also have an effect on both the bond and stock markets. I can understand why all of this can be concerning, but overall, the fact that the Fed is raising rates is a positive—not only because it reflects their confidence in the strength of the economy, but also because controlling inflation is essential for the economy’s long-term health. That said, rising interest rates will have an impact on all of us, so it’s important to understand what it means for your different accounts, loans and investments. Broadly speaking, an increase in rates is good for savers and bad for borrowers. It's more of a mixed bag for investors, depending on the types of investments you hold. Let’s take a look. Impact on savers A rise in interest rates is good news for savers, although the impact on short-term savings accounts, CDs and money market accounts will take time. Competitive pressures will eventually encourage financial institutions to offer higher rates, so it will be increasingly important to shop around, re-examine how much you need to have in cash and always be mindful of fees and charges that can reduce your returns—regardless of how much and when rates rise. Impact on borrowers Whether you're financing a new car or carrying a balance on your credit card, it may cost you more. If you have a choice between a variable or fixed interest rate loan, it's probably better to lock in low-cost financing sooner rather than later. Mortgage rates are also on the rise, which is significant if you're applying for a new home loan or have a variable-rate mortgage. Consider that a one percent interest rate increase can increase the cost of a $300,000 mortgage by over $2,000 a year. Interestingly though, rising interest rates may also lead to a deceleration in home prices, so sellers will want to factor that into their plans. Also keep in mind that the Federal Reserve has a lot more control over short-term rates than long-term rates. And as borrowing costs go up, people tend to buy less, which can shift demand and prices lower. If you think your job or business may be impacted negatively by rising rates, take extra care to look at your balance sheet and emergency funds. Impact on bond investors When interest rates rise, bond values decrease. However, the impact will vary depending on your circumstances. Here are three possible scenarios courtesy of my colleague at Schwab, Kathy Jones: If you've been on the sidelines waiting for interest rates to rise, you might consider investing in intermediate-term bonds or bond funds that mature in five-to-ten years to boost income in your portfolio. You might also consider building a bond ladder by buying individual bonds or bond funds with different maturities. Bond ladders work because they give you the flexibility to make changes as interest rates change. If you're currently invested in long-term bonds, this could be a good time to add some short-term bonds or cash to add balance and reduce volatility. If you're already invested in intermediate-term bonds or already have a bond ladder, you may not need to make changes. But again, you could consider adding some short-term bonds or cash to reduce potential volatility as rates change or extending the term or maturity of fixed income holdings as rates rise to lock in higher yields. Impact on stock investors Generally speaking, interest rate hikes depress stock prices, which can translate to more market volatility. The good news is that because of all the speculation on when and by how much rates will rise, it’s largely already built into stock prices. Therefore, rate increases may not have that big of an impact. As always, it’s important to be diversified and to maintain a long-term view. I firmly believe that regardless of increases in interest rates, stocks remain the best way to build long-term wealth. It’s still important to spread out your investments globally in a variety of sizes and types of companies, industries and sectors because interest rate hikes will likely mean different things for different sectors of the market. And it’s difficult to predict how any single company will react. Keeping a balanced perspective Granted, this is a lot to consider, but try not to over-react. It's easy to be swayed by the never-ending media speculation and hyperbole, but if you keep on top of your own financial situation, stay diversified and true to your goals, and use extra care when borrowing, you should be able to mitigate any negative impact of a rise in interest rates—and perhaps even turn it to your advantage.

       "   'content': 'The world\\'s second-largest economy has likely slipped into a recession, at least by China\\'s standards. Severe lockdowns in response to the latest COVID-19 outbreaks have resulted in a sharp economic slowdown. Many economists have downgraded their China gross domestic product (GDP) growth targets for this year, citing risks from the zero-COVID policy. Most notably, the International Monetary Fund recently lowered its China GDP growth forecast for 2022 to 4.4%, well below the government\\'s target of about 5.5%. Locked down The most dramatic of these recent lockdowns saw tens of millions of people confined to their homes in Shanghai during April. Data to be reported this week on April\\'s retail sales in China is expected to show a drop of -7.5% from a year ago. But there may be even worse news. China reported a steep drop in tourist spending for the five-day Labor Day national holiday in early May. Tourist spending was down 43% from the same period last year, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers\\' Index, a closely watched indicator of the services sector of China\\'s economy, plunged to 36.2 in April from 42 in March (below 50 indicates contraction). The impact is considerable, as the services sector accounts for more than half of China\\'s GDP and over 40% of the country\\'s employment. While the extent of the contraction was not as severe as the nationwide lockdown during the initial outbreak in February 2020, the sudden drop is beyond a normal cyclical fluctuation. With China\\'s manufacturing sector also shrinking last month, it appears that the world\\'s second-biggest economy may have gotten smaller in April. China\\'s downturn not yet as deep as February 2020 Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 5/5/2022. Short-term impact In the short term, China\\'s economic outlook largely depends on the success of its COVID strategy. There are some indications that May could be better than April: around 16.7 million of Shanghai\\'s 25 million people are now allowed to leave their neighborhoods as of May 5, following a sharp decline in new cases. However, getting cases under control has been difficult and Shanghai increased restrictions in some areas over the weekend. Beijing has been able to keep new case numbers to dozens per day, reducing the likelihood it would be subject to a strict lockdown, but curbs could still dampen consumer spending. Cities in China are now requiring residents test at least once a week, striving towards shorter, more targeted lockdowns that may reduce economic costs in the coming months. Daily new COVID cases in Shanghai Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 5/5/2022. The Chinese government\\'s announcements of additional economic stimulus policies replacing the surge in regulations seen last year may not gain much traction until lockdowns ease and those incentives can be put into action. The potential for strong stimulus post-economic reopening can be seen in the quantity and emphasis of new initiatives. For example, in February 2020 China\\'s leadership called on officials to \"actively expand effective demand.\" But, the tone in their April 2022 communication seems more aggressive, instructing \"all-out efforts to expand domestic demand.\" Signaling its unwillingness to surrender the 5.5% growth target for 2022 despite the recent sharp slowdown, the Politburo implored officials to \"work hard to achieve the full-year forecast targets.\" Surging stimulus policies replacing 2021 government restrictions Source: Charles Schwab, Piper Sandler data as of 5/5/2022. In the same April communication, China\\'s leaders also addressed other issues of concern weighing on the economy. Most notably, they proposed to normalize regulation of internet platforms and deliver specific policies to support their healthy development, including a focus on supporting housing using a variety of monetary policy tools. In another sign of economic accommodation, China recently relented on key points of contention related to U.S. officials conducting on-site inspections of local auditors of U.S.-listed Chinese firms, diffusing the threat of delisting for China\\'s companies listed on U.S. exchanges. China\\'s policymakers appear to be targeting higher growth in the second half of the year to make up for lockdown losses in the first half and achieve their 5.5% 2022 growth target. If China can\\'t get the COVID outbreaks under control, recessionary pressures may linger and global supply chain delays may continue to worsen, increasing inflationary pressures. Alternatively, China reopens and the powerful stimulus boosts demand for commodities and puts upward pressure on commodity prices and inflation. Either scenario implies that commodity prices and inflation may rebound after recently easing due to China\\'s economic pullback and its lagged impact on supply chains (which may have yet to be widely felt). For example, the recent slump in copper prices may reverse on an uptick of China\\'s production and infrastructure demand, given very low inventories of the essential metal in China. This suggests the market environment favoring shorter duration stocks may continue (for more, read Hedging Stocks Against Rising Rates). Copper prices have weakened recently Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 5/5/2022. Long-term impact Over the longer term, any extended disruption to consumer spending and business output is a risk to China-exposed companies. Apple has warned of an earnings hit of up to $8 billion from COVID-related supply disruptions; General Electric reports that lockdowns are suppressing demand as well as causing supply-chain problems. Beyond a raised risk for a short-term earnings miss, there may be a risk that global businesses slow or stop investing in China over the longer-term. U.S. and European business investment in China grew steadily over the past decade, even during the height of President Trump\\'s trade war with China. In fact, China\\'s inbound foreign direct investment in 2021 rose by a third, reaching a new all-time high of $334 billion USD. Major manufacturers, like Tesla, Ford, Nike, and Apple increased their investments, attracted to China\\'s growing market and unmatched production competences. The waves of global COVID infections in 2020 and 2021 saw other countries that compete with China for export business suffer output gaps; China won more business as the government found ways to keep factories running. Foreign direct investment in China Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 5/8/2022. * This $334 billion USD measure of FDI inflows is broad and includes new nonfinancial investment, reinvested profits of existing nonfinancial foreign affiliates, as well as foreign investment and reinvestment in financial institutions in China. This series reported by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) differs from the FDI inflation series reported by the Ministry of Commerce of China (MOFCOM) depicted in the chart in that the charted data does not include reinvested earnings of existing foreign firms and foreign investment in China’s financial sector. More recently though, a survey by AmCham Shanghai conducted at the end of March showed that 49% of companies say they will reduce investment in China if the current COVID restrictions remain in place into next year. China may be losing its edge: 60% of companies and 82% of manufacturers now report their production slowed during the present outbreak due to lack of employees, inability to obtain supplies, or explicit factory halts resulting from the lockdowns. Should major companies begin to abandon China it could result in some big costs—both in terms of lost sales and higher production costs. For example, we\\'ve seen some high costs associated with businesses abandoning their Russian operations, such as the $5 billion reported by Shell. A step back from China would probably entail much greater costs, given how deeply integrated China is in the world\\'s supply chains and as a consumer market.

       "   'content': 'Every couple has its own way of dividing up household duties. When it comes to money matters, the responsible spouse may effectively become the family\\'s chief financial officer (CFO), which can work well for years or even decades—until that person is no longer able or willing to carry out his or her duties. Without adequate planning, the death or incapacity of the de facto CFO can leave family members to grapple with a host of unknowns, including what bills need to be paid and where short- and long-term funds are kept—to say nothing of estate-planning and portfolio-management particulars. \"On top of that, they\\'re going through all this while dealing with the death or declining health of a loved one,\" says Joe Reyes, a Schwab senior financial planner. The best way to handle any crisis is to plan for it in advance, Joe says. In a corporate setting, for example, an understudy would often be named, trained, and ready to take the reins at a moment\\'s notice—and a family with assets to protect should be no different. Key to this transition is foresight. In a worst-case scenario, for example, how would a death affect potential sources of income, such as pensions and Social Security? Would the surviving spouse need to reduce spending or sell assets to maintain a balanced budget? What steps would need to be taken to settle the family estate? Also critical is transparency. Kim Frank, a Schwab wealth strategist, recommends that families establish and maintain a comprehensive list of assets and expenses for the executor or trustee of the estate, who is most commonly the surviving spouse. \"That way, both spouses can go into the document at any time to see their resources and liabilities,\" Kim says, \"which makes picking up the pieces in the event of loss a whole lot easier.\" Paying the bills is often the most immediate concern following a spouse\\'s death or incapacity. Automated recurring bill payments make this chore more convenient. The downside is that paperless billing by definition leaves no paper trail for others to follow. Keeping a list of such bills helps. However, a death certificate (in the case of loss) or a durable financial power of attorney (in the case of incapacity) may be required for a direct beneficiary to gain full control of any online accounts to which he or she doesn’t already have access. Letters of testamentary may also be required if the deceased’s assets are not held in a trust or if an executor, a spouse, or a trustee has no direct beneficiary relationship to the deceased. Another important resource is a roster of all the people who help manage financial matters, including accountants, estate attorneys, and financial advisors familiar with a family\\'s long-term goals. Ideally, though, these key players should be more than just names on a piece of paper. \"Even if you\\'re not the hands-on spouse, being present in meetings and listening to what’s being said can be extremely beneficial,\" Kim says. Financial consultants can provide critical guidance even when there’s been little or no estate planning. That said, \"such situations can involve probate and other complications that might easily have been avoided had there been better preparation,\" Joe says. Of course, many people would rather not contemplate the potential passing of a loved one, never mind their own mortality. But looking past emotions and making plans now can help ensure that important decisions aren\\'t left to chance. \"It\\'s really about working with an attorney to make sure your wishes are clearly articulated and codified,\" Kim says. If such conversations sound intimidating to you, you aren\\'t alone. \"I actually had to fool my family into looking at our financial plan,\" Joe says. \"I gathered everybody around the TV and said, \\'Hey, I\\'ve got something to show you!\\' Then I took out my phone and projected it right on the TV. I said, \\'Don’t move—we\\'re all going to look at this.\\'\" That evening\\'s entertainment may not have been binge-worthy, but it was definitely must-see TV. \"My family now gets the gist of it—and they know whom to call for help,\" Joe says. \"And I consider that a giant success.\" Four easy pieces The records essential to ensuring a smooth transition to a new family CFO: Accounts: Maintain a list of all bank, insurance, investment, and other accounts, including digital services such as PayPal and Venmo. Cash flow: List all potential sources of income—including insurance, pensions, retirement accounts, and Social Security. Alongside them list all financial obligations, including car and mortgage payments, subscriptions, and utilities. Contacts: List the names and contact information of all professionals who help oversee family assets, including accountants, attorneys, financial planners, insurance agents, and portfolio managers. Legal documents: Keep hard copies of health-care directives, trusts, wills, and the like in a secure place.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Cash serves a valuable role in many investors\\' portfolios. It can pay the bills and fund short-term goals—a key reason it\\'s important to keep enough cash around to meet your immediate needs. \"Don\\'t take investment risk with money you need soon,\" says Rob Williams, CFP®, CPWA®, managing director of financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"But keep in mind, cash and cash investments—beyond money you\\'ve set aside for spending right away—can be a part of your portfolio as well.\" Cash, both for savings and expense management and for investing, can help you play defense during market downturns by reducing the impact of market volatility on your returns. But cash isn\\'t always king, depending on why you hold it. Sometimes our emotions enter the picture and hold undue sway over our investing decisions. Loss aversion—in which the pain of loss is felt more strongly than the pleasure of an equivalent gain—is a real phenomenon and can manifest itself in a number of ways. For some, it might mean cashing out of investments to avoid losses when the going appears to be getting tough. Others could be avoiding (or not allocating enough) to stocks and other assets that could potentially earn more over time. The result can be a cash-heavy portfolio, which can have a downside. The key is the right balance, for your time horizon and needs. In this article, we look at three reasons you should consider putting your cash to work. 1. Cash generally loses purchasing power when you factor in inflation The value of every dollar you hold fluctuates as the broad level of prices (i.e., inflation) rises and falls. Inflation tends to increase over time, which means the dollar you held a year or two or three years ago won\\'t buy as much today. That loss in purchasing power can add up meaningfully over time. By not investing in stocks or higher-yielding bonds, your money doesn\\'t have the potential opportunity to earn interest or grow. Consider what happens when inflation averages out at 3%. Inflation can severely erode purchasing power over time It\\'s important to understand the effects of inflation because it decreases the amount of goods or services you can buy (purchasing power), all else being equal. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research The \"nominal\" amount is the stated value. The \"real\" amount is the value adjusted for the effects of inflation. Inflation is represented by the change in the Consumer Price Index for AII Urban Consumers (CPI-U). From 2002 to 2021, inflation averaged 2.3%. But during some periods in the past, the average was much higher: It averaged 6.2% from 1970–1989. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. A person who has $100,000 sees the real purchasing power of that money shrink to $74,400 after 10 years and all the way down to $55,368 after 20 years. In this case, a portfolio made up entirely of cash still loses value—and lots of it—declining 26% by year 10 and by 45% by year 20. Inflation has been running even higher in recent months. In March 2022, for instance, the consumer price index recorded an annual gain of 8.5%. If that level of inflation persisted, the loss of purchasing power would be far greater than calculated above. 2. Low interest rates can undercut your earning potential You can allocate your cash in short-term investments to try to keep up with the pace of inflation, but your earning potential is heavily influenced by the current level of interest rates. Historically low rates continue to suppress returns on interest-bearing savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and money market accounts—all popular vehicles for investing short-term assets. Even with the Federal Reserve enacting the second of what economists currently expect to be a series rate hikes, short-term rates may remain below their long-term averages for several more months. That means you likely shouldn\\'t wait for rates to rise if you want to stay ahead of inflation, but rather, you should maximize what you can afford to invest in assets with a potential for higher returns over time, such as stocks and bonds. Consider the hypothetical example of two people—Alexis and Diego—who both inherited $200,000 in 2001. To illustrate the point, let\\'s factor out inflation and assume that neither withdraw any of their inheritance.

Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research The moderate model portfolio (allocated 35% large-cap stocks, 35% fixed income, 15% international stocks, 10% small-cap stocks, and 5% cash investments) may not be suitable for all investors. Returns assume reinvestment of dividends and interest. Fees and expenses would lower returns. This chart represents a hypothetical investment and is for illustrative purposes only. The actual rate of return will fluctuate with market conditions. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. While historical returns are no guarantee of future results, the example highlights the significant gap in returns from being too conservative over long investing periods. 3. Overallocation to cash can limit your opportunities for growth Moving to a higher cash allocation is a lever that investors often pull when they believe they need protection against significant losses or liquidity to fund an upcoming expense (e.g., a college education or home purchase), but some go too far in liquidating their higher-yielding alternatives—particularly during market volatility. Schwab\\'s most conservative model portfolio allocates 30% to cash investments, with the balance split between 50% fixed income assets and 20% in equities. If you\\'re considering ever increasing your cash allocation beyond this threshold, it\\'s wise to keep two things in mind: It\\'s difficult to time the market consistently and successfully. Research conducted by Schwab shows that the cost of waiting for the perfect moment to invest typically exceeds the benefit of even perfect timing. Cash has historically underperformed other asset classes. The chart below shows that these differences can be significant over time, especially relative to returns for small- and large-cap stocks, international stocks, and bonds. Portfolio value by investment type compared to inflation Over a 20-year time horizon from 2001 to the end of 2021, the performance of $200,000 invested in a large-cap equity, a moderate portfolio (35% fixed income, 35% large-cap equity, 15% international equity, 5% small cap equity, and 5% cash investments), and fixed income assets experienced higher growth than a portfolio kept in cash and cash equivalents. The all-cash portfolio was also valued lower than the buying power of $200,000 adjusted for inflation—that is, the amount needed at the current inflation rate to purchase the equivalent value of goods or services in 2001.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. \"Timing the market is technically and, more often than not, emotionally difficult,\" Rob notes. \"But if you have money and savings that you don\\'t need soon, staying invested in stocks and other investments has more potential to earn a higher return over time.\" Also, keep in mind that you should revisit your portfolio and evaluate your plan regularly (annually is a good place to start). Your plans and risk tolerance might change due to any number of extenuating circumstances, and portfolios need to be rebalanced as allocations to any asset class—stocks, bonds, and cash among them—can get out of sync with your plan and goals over time. Bottom line: Cash isn\\'t always the safe course There are plenty of good reasons to keep some of your hard-earned savings in cash and cash investments. But make sure that based on your goals, you\\'re not holding too much—especially because you\\'re wary of volatility in investments in the short-term. Holding outsized cash positions can reduce long-term earnings potential. This is particularly relevant in the case of younger investors, who have plenty of time to make up for market downturns before they need to tap their savings. And it\\'s also true of those approaching retirement, who might be able to pad their retirement savings by reducing their cash balances. \"When I ask clients why they aren\\'t investing their money in assets with higher earning potential,\" Rob explains, \"the answers I hear more often—especially after a number of years of strong market performance—are a fear to commit to stocks or higher-yielding bonds that are perceived as too expensive, the threat that a market correction is underway or imminent, and the assumption that rising interest rates are causing or will cause the value of bonds to fall.\" The best defense against making emotional investment decisions is to invest in a disciplined way. Based on when you need the money, save and invest each month in a diversified basket of investments with the potential to grow with the U.S. and global economy over time. How you split your assets between stocks, bonds, cash, and other asset classes can change as conditions or the timing of your needs warrant. But the key is to maintain at least some exposure to all of them, keeping in mind your goals and time horizon. Holding too much cash might seem like the safe course at times, but you might find it costs you more in the long run.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Looking for a meaningful college graduation present? Consider opening up the world of investing.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Finding the right gift for a college graduate can be tough. It's nearly impossible to pick out the latest gadget—let alone the latest fashions—and giving just cash may strike you as too impersonal. So, what can you give a young person, just starting out, that would be useful and meaningful? Consider opening up the world of investing. Many young people find the idea of investing intimidating or figure they'll wait until they have more money to put away. That's a shame, because they often miss out on one of the most powerful drivers of return: time in the market. Compounding can have a substantial impact on the value of money, and the earlier your college grad starts investing, the greater the potential benefit. Compounding makes a lifelong difference Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research This example is for illustrative purposes only and does not indicate or guarantee future performance. It is not intended to represent a specific investment product. Assumes 6% average annual growth and does not account for any fees, costs, or taxes. The actual annual rate of return and values will fluctuate with market conditions. How can you help a young person start down the path to a lifetime of saving? Consider the following gift ideas: 1. Match savings contributions Saving can be hard to do on a small salary, but it's an important skill to learn. Encourage your new graduate to open a savings account to stash away money for an apartment, a new car, or some other goal—and as an incentive, make the initial deposit and offer to match a portion of their contributions. Keep in mind that taxes may apply on gifts, depending on the amount gifted. Currently, you can give up to $16,000 per recipient ($32,000 if you’re giving as a couple) without reducing the lifetime gift exemption (in 2022: $12.06 million if single, $24.12 million if married). Check with your tax advisor or the IRS website for more information. 2. Fund an IRA Help your new grad open a tax-advantaged individual retirement account (IRA) to jumpstart retirement investing. IRAs can be effective savings tools, especially if your grad isn't yet working for a company that offers a workplace retirement plan like a 401(k). Roth IRAs, which are funded with after-tax dollars and offer tax-deferred growth and earnings—as well as tax- and penalty-free withdrawals in retirement1—are particularly practical for younger investors, who are likely to be in a lower tax bracket today than they will be in retirement. Roths also provide flexibility, since contributions can be withdrawn at any time without tax or penalty.2 However, grads should be encouraged to keep the funds invested for retirement. One thing to keep in mind is that you'll have to make sure the graduate has earned income that's greater than or equal to any contributions made to the account. You'll also want to consider potential gift tax liability unless funding the IRA is your only gift, as the annual gift-tax exclusion is greater than the maximum allowable IRA contribution ($6,000 in 2022 for all under 50). 3. Give stocks with youth appeal The stock market can be intimidating to young people, who often don't know where to start. The great thing is that time is on their side. They will have plenty of time to recover if a high-growth stock runs out of steam or a portfolio begins its life a bit unbalanced. To pave the way, start by helping the recipient establish a brokerage account if they don't have one already. Once that's out of the way, consider piquing their interest in investing by gifting individual stocks in companies they like or shares in a mutual or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in sectors that interest them, like technology or biotech. If they're socially conscious, consider gifting them shares of an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) fund. There are dozens of such funds in the market that seek to invest in companies engaged in environmental or social justice causes, or companies that are pushing for changes in business practices to emphasize equity, diversity, and accountability. In each case, be sure to communicate the importance of an emergency fund that allows the young investor to leave investments in long-term positions when times get tight. 4. Automated investing Automated investment advisory services, or robo-advisors, can help build a portfolio that is appropriate for various goals and time horizons. For young people, robo-advisors have a lot of appeal, and funding an account could be a great gift for new grads. It's easy to get started. Typically, most investors only need to answer an online questionnaire to establish their goals, risk profile, and timeline before reviewing their recommended portfolio. There's no need to speak to a human investment professional (unless they want to), and many robo-advisors have additional tools to help track performance and progress toward goals—all monitored easily on a mobile device. 1 Withdrawal of earnings from a Roth IRA are generally tax- and penalty-free if the account has been open for at least five years and the withdrawals are taken after age 59½. 2 Earnings are subject to taxes and/or penalties depending on the individual’s age, how long the account has been opened, and the purpose of the withdrawal.

       "   'abstract': 'Given that tighter financial conditions are on the horizon, high-yield bonds may not be as attractive as they have been over the past few years. We look at four factors that indicate it may be especially prudent to proceed with caution when it comes to high-yield bonds.',\n",
       "   'content': 'We are growing more cautious with high-yield bonds. While the higher yields they offer may seem attractive, risks are on the rise. Economic growth is expected to slow this year compared to last, as indicated by the first-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report, which may weigh on corporate profits. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is planning an aggressive pace of rate hikes, which should result in tighter financial conditions and higher borrowing costs. Given those myriad risks, investors should proceed with caution with high-yield bonds. Volatility should remain elevated and prices may fall relative to Treasuries. With yields on higher quality investments up so much this year, we prefer investors move up in quality today and wait for better opportunities to take on more risk down the road. We see four reasons why investors should proceed with caution: 1. Relative yields are still low. Corporate bonds generally offer higher yields than Treasuries—called \"credit spreads\"—to compensate for the risk of lending to a corporation, like the risk of default. The risk of default tends to be higher with lower-rated bonds, like high-yield bonds. After all, they\\'re called \"junk\" bonds for a reason. Currently, investors aren\\'t well compensated for those risks. The average option-adjusted spread of the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index is up sharply from the 2021 lows. After touching a post-pandemic low of just 2.62% last July, the average spread is now 3.88%. Despite the more than 100-basis-point rise, we believe investors should be compensated with even higher spreads to make up for the increasing risks in the market. The prospect of higher spreads doesn\\'t just mean that it may present investors a more attractive opportunity later on. Rising spreads also pose a risk to current bond holders, as those spreads could pull down the price of your junk bond investments. High-yield spreads are still low Source: Bloomberg, using daily data as of 5/2/2022. Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index (LF98TRUU Index). Option-adjusted spreads are quoted as a fixed spread, or differential, over U.S. Treasury issues. OAS is a method used in calculating the relative value of a fixed income security containing an embedded option, such as a borrower\\'s option to prepay a loan. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 2. Borrowing costs are on the rise. When junk bond yields rise, it becomes more expensive for issuers to borrow in the bond market. On the bright side, most high-yield bonds have fixed coupon rates, meaning their coupon rates are set at the time of issuance. If a company issued a fixed-rate junk bond with a five-year maturity last year, the recent rise in rates doesn\\'t change the coupon rate paid today. Luckily there\\'s not much debt coming due in the near-term. Of the $1.4 trillion outstanding bonds in the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index, only $170 billion, or 11% of the index, is scheduled to mature in the next three years. Companies that need to issue debt today, however, are facing higher borrowing costs. That can be a problem for issuers looking to refinance debt that was issued at lower rates. As the chart below illustrates, the average yield of the high-yield bond index is now above the average coupon rate. That means that the cost of borrowing today (on average) is above the average rate paid by outstanding bonds—and companies that are refinancing now are likely refinancing at higher rates. (Keep in mind that we are referring to averages; the average yield or coupon rate can depend on factors such as maturity, credit quality, industry, etc.) One concern for higher borrowing costs is the impact on corporate profits, discussed below. The average yield of the high-yield bond index is now above the average coupon rate Source: Bloomberg, using daily data as of 5/2/2022. Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index (LF98TRUU Index). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 3. Corporate profit growth is already slowing. This trend started in the fourth quarter of 2021 and, based on 1Q22 earnings announcements, the trend appears to be continuing. Rather than focus on individual corporate earnings announcements, we focus on corporate profit data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). These numbers are based on the actual corporate production data used to compute GDP and offer a much more comprehensive look at corporate profits. While earnings from the members of the S&P 500 index are important, the corporate profit data from the BEA focuses on companies of all sizes, as well as both public and private companies. In the fourth quarter of 2021, corporate profits grew just 0.7% for the quarter. The level of corporate profits is still high, so this isn\\'t all doom and gloom. But trends matter, and if corporate growth continues to slow, investors may continue to demand higher spreads to lend to risky issuers. That can pull junk bond yields higher, and prices lower. Source: Bloomberg, using quarterly data as of 4Q2021. US Corporate Profits With IVA and CCA Total SAAR (CPFTTOT Index). Note: Y-axis is truncated at 12%; actual increase for 3Q20 was 25%. Some key risks for corporate profits and profit margins are the impact of inflation, supply chain issues, and borrowing costs. Rising borrowing costs via higher interest payments can eat into corporate profits. Meanwhile, wage gains are good for consumers, but can be a pain point for corporations, as it\\'s another input cost on the rise. Supply chain bottlenecks pose a risk for the high-yield market because issuers tend to have volatile cash flows or weak balance sheets even in good times—a few reasons why they have such low ratings in the first place. If disruptions in the supply chain prevent a company from providing a good or service, cash flows received from end customers would likely be delayed as well. When you couple that with rising input costs, like higher wages for employees, there could be less cash available to pay bondholders. 4. A flat or inverted yield curve usually spells trouble for high-yield bonds. There\\'s an old saying that, \"When the Fed tightens, things break,\" and the high-yield bond market usually shows cracks as the Fed hikes rates—especially when the yield curve is flat or inverted. There are many yield curve slopes out there, but two key slopes are the two-year/10-year Treasury slope and the three-month/10-year Treasury slope. Today, they are telling us different things. While the two-year/10-year slope is very flat, after briefly inverting in early April, the three-month/10-Year slope remains near its seven-year highs. The two-year/10-year slope is flat while the three-month/10-year slope is steep Source: Bloomberg, using daily data as of 4/28/2022. Market Matrix US Sell 3 Month & Buy 10 Year Bond Yield Spread (USYC3M10 Index) and Market Matrix US Sell 2 Year & Buy 10 Year Bond Yield Spread (USYC2Y10 Index). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Over time, high-yield bond total returns relative to Treasuries have been strongest when the yield curve is steep. As the curve flattens, and ultimately inverts, the relative return deteriorates. The table below compares the average 12-month total return of the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index relative to the Bloomberg U.S. Intermediate Treasury Index, depending on the starting slope of the two-year/10-year yield curve. When the slope is between zero and 100 basis points, the relative return is low but positive; when the slope is inverted, that average relative return plunges. With the two-year/10-year curve at roughly 20 basis points today, caution is warranted. High-yield bond returns tend to be low when the yield curve is flat or inverted 2-year/10-year slope 2-year/10-year slope Table shows the 2-year/10-year slope\\'s average relative return resulting from various starting yield curve slopes.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The table below compares those same relative returns with the slope of the three-month/10-year Treasury yield curve. The takeaway is the same: when the yield curve flattens, returns tend to deteriorate. The slope of the three-month/10-year Treasury curve is roughly 205 basis points today. But we believe it will flatten quickly as the Fed aggressively hikes rates this year. The 10-year Treasury yield may rise modestly higher from here, but the three-month Treasury yield is likely to rise much more. Based on market expectations for the pace of Fed rate hikes, this yield curve could be less than 100 basis points—or possibly inverted—by the end of the year.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. What to do now Proceed with caution with high-yield bonds today. That doesn\\'t mean abandoning your high yield holdings, but investors who are overweight high-yield bonds should consider paring back positions to an allocation that\\'s more in line with long-term, strategic allocations. High-yield bonds had been attractive over the past two years as most other bond yields were stuck near historic lows. But today there are ways to earn higher yields without taking on so much risk, as the chart below illustrates. The yields offered on many higher-rated bond investments aren\\'t just up from the end of 2021, they\\'re close to the highs of the past 10 years. Intermediate-term investment grade corporates appear attractive today Source: Bloomberg. As of 5/2/22.

Historically, the start of a rate hike cycle didn\\'t end a credit market rally, but the end did. Even though the Fed has just started to hike rates, market expectations are pointing to a fast pace of hikes going forward, and the cycle may be over soon. We suggest you play a little defense now, as tighter financial conditions should lead to more volatility—and potential price declines—in the high-yield bond market. Find bonds that are right for you.

Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. Lower-rated securities are subject to greater credit risk, default risk, and liquidity risk. Diversification and asset allocation strategies do not ensure a profit and do not protect against losses in declining markets. International investments involve additional risks, which include differences in financial accounting standards, currency fluctuations, geopolitical risk, foreign taxes and regulations, and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks. Preferred securities are often callable, meaning the issuing company may redeem the security at a certain price after a certain date. Such call features may affect yield. Preferred securities generally have lower credit ratings and a lower claim to assets than the issuer\\'s individual bonds. Like bonds, prices of preferred securities tend to move inversely with interest rates, so they are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Investment value will fluctuate, and preferred securities, when sold before maturity, may be worth more or less than original cost. Preferred securities are subject to various other risks including changes in interest rates and credit quality, default risks, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, deferral risk, corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors.

       "   'content': 'According to the Plan Sponsor Council of America, Roth 401(k)s are now permitted for nearly 90% of retirement plans. If your employer is among them, you may be wondering how a Roth 401(k) differs from a Roth IRA. \"Both Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are funded with after-tax dollars—meaning there\\'s no upfront tax benefit for contributing—but once you get to retirement, you can withdraw the contributions and earnings totally tax-free,\"1 says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"However, Roth 401(k)s offer additional benefits that should not be overlooked.\" Chief among them: No income limits: Anyone can contribute to a Roth 401(k), if available, regardless of income level. In contrast, only individuals earning less than $144,000 in 2022—$214,000 for married couples—can contribute to a Roth IRA. \"Higher earners often access Roth IRAs by converting their traditional IRAs, but doing so can trigger a big tax bill,\" Hayden says. \"Saving in a Roth 401(k) could be a better way to go if the taxes on a Roth IRA conversion are prohibitive.\" Higher contribution limits: In 2022, you can stash away up to $20,500 in a Roth 401(k)—$27,000 if you\\'re age 50 or older.2 Roth IRA contributions, by comparison, are capped at $6,000—$7,000 if you\\'re 50 or older. Matching contributions: Roth 401(k)s are eligible for matching contributions from your employer, if offered. That said, your employer\\'s matching contributions are pretax and will be placed in a regular, tax-deferred 401(k) account, which means you\\'ll be taxed once you start taking distributions. One potential disadvantage of using a Roth 401(k)—at least relative to a Roth IRA—is that you\\'ll have to take IRS-mandated required minimum distributions (RMDs) starting at age 72. To avoid these mandatory distributions and keep your money invested, once you leave your job you can roll over your Roth 401(k) into a Roth IRA, which aren\\'t subject to RMDs.3 Another drawback is that you\\'ll be limited to the investments offered by your company\\'s plan instead of the variety available with a Roth IRA from a brokerage. Investment fees may also be higher. \"Nevertheless, Roth 401(k)s can still be a great tool—especially for high-wage earners and/or those who anticipate higher taxes in retirement,\" Hayden says. 1 Account holder must be 59½ or older and have owned the account for at least five years. 2 You may choose to split your contributions between Roth and traditional 401(k)s, but your combined contributions can\\'t exceed $20,500 ($27,000 if you\\'re age 50 or older). 3 Be aware that the five-year rule applies to the length of time the Roth IRA has been open, regardless of how long the Roth 401(k) was open.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My daughter was lucky enough to receive a significant college scholarship. Is this considered taxable income to her? And does her scholarship limit my ability to claim an education tax credit? —A Reader Dear Reader, Congratulations to your daughter—and to you. Her scholarship can be a significant financial boost for both of you. And this is a great question because it touches on issues that both students and parents need to be aware of when filing tax returns. First, the good news for your daughter is that scholarship money, for the most part, isn't taxable because it isn't considered income. The good news for you is that you still may be able to claim an education tax credit on your return as long as you pay qualified expenses above and beyond what your daughter's scholarship covers. Of course, when it comes to taxes, there's rarely a simple yes or no answer. So before you start celebrating, let's look a little more closely at each situation. Scholarships that are tax-free According to the IRS, certain conditions must be met for a scholarship or fellowship to be tax-free: The student must be a degree candidate at an eligible educational institution, which generally means an institution with a regular faculty and curriculum and a regularly enrolled body of students. The scholarship or fellowship money is used for qualified expenses. This includes tuition and fees, books, and course- or degree-related costs (like supplies and equipment required for specific classes). It does not include other college-related costs such as room, board, and travel. The money does not represent wages for teaching or other work (unless services are required by certain scholarship programs). That sounds pretty clear. However, let me reiterate that for a scholarship to be completely tax-free, all the money must be used for qualified education expenses. For example, if your daughter received a $10,000 scholarship and tuition was $15,000, she wouldn't owe taxes on the money. However, if her scholarship was $20,000 and $5,000 went for room and board, that $5,000 would be considered taxable income. Scholarships considered taxable income Now, let's say your daughter is a grad student with a fellowship that requires her to be a teaching assistant. In this case, the tax rules are different. That's because scholarship or fellowship money that represents compensation is generally taxable. The student would receive a W-2 from the school and would have to file a tax return. Get more from Ask Carrie. Go to Ask Carrie hub A couple of exceptions These IRS rules apply to scholarships (both merit and athletic), fellowships, and grants—including government-sponsored, need-based Pell Grants. However, there are exceptions. For example, payments made through the GI Bill aren't considered scholarships nor are they considered taxable income. Students participating in the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program or the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship and Financial Assistance Program generally don't pay taxes on their aid for qualified education expense either. Student loans, of course, are not taxable since they aren't considered income and have to be repaid. And just to be very clear, scholarships awarded to students who are not in a degree program are always taxable. How education tax credits fit in Education tax credits, which directly reduce the amount of income tax you pay, could be another way to offset some of your daughter's qualified college expenses, depending on your income. There are two possible credits available for 2022: American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)—This credit allows an annual maximum credit of $2,500 per student for four years of undergraduate education. To qualify for the full credit, your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) must be $80,000 or less ($160,000 or less for married filing jointly). The credit is phased out for single filer taxpayers with incomes above $80,000 but below $90,000 (between $160,000–$180,000 for joint filers). Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC)—This credit allows a maximum of $2,000 per year per tax return (not per student), and it can apply to undergraduate, graduate, or professional degree courses, with no limit on the number of years. Income and phase out limitations are the same as for the AOTC ($80,000–$90,000 for single filers and $160,000–$180,000 for married filing jointly). If you qualify for both credits, you must choose one or the other. You can't use both tax credits on the same student in a single tax year. Don't forget deductions If you're paying interest on a student loan for your daughter's education, you may be eligible to deduct up to $2,500, provided your 2022 MAGI is less than $70,000 ($145,000 if filing a joint return). This deduction is completely phased out once MAGI is $85,000 or more ($175,000 or more for joint returns). Get the full details This is just the topline information, but it should give you a good start. To make sure your situation falls within all the IRS parameters, visit the Tax Benefits for Education: Information Center on the IRS website or consult IRS Publication 970: Tax Benefits for Education. Better yet, talk to your accountant or other tax professional. And best of luck to your daughter. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, We've been saving in a 529 account for years for our son's education, but it now looks like he won't be going to college. Are there other options for using this money? —A Reader Dear Reader, One of the great—and challenging—things about having kids is that they can surprise you at every turn. While you can save diligently for their education, you can't predict what their talents or interests will be. Trust me—as a mother of three, I know from experience! I think many of us envision a four-year college for our kids, but that's only one of a myriad of choices, especially today. So, does that mean a 529 account is no longer a good idea? Absolutely not. Because while a 529 is generally referred to as a college savings account, it can be used for other types of education. And recent tax laws give you even more options. The most common—post-high school education There are lots of ways kids can continue their education post high school, and a 529 is there to help them. Assets in a 529 can be used at any eligible institution of higher education. That includes not only four-year colleges and universities but also qualifying two-year associate degree programs, trade schools, and vocational schools—both at home and abroad. This means that if your child chooses to pursue post-secondary training in their chosen field—whether as a computer expert or cosmetologist, an artist or an electrician—there's a good chance you can pay for that training with your 529 assets. In your son's case, if he has another type of school in mind, find out if it qualifies for 529 assets. Generally speaking, to qualify, a school must be eligible to participate in student aid programs offered by the Department of Education. Savingforcollege.com has an easy online tool for determining if a particular school qualifies. You just need to take the time to do a little research—or better yet, have your son do it. Possibilities before high school—and after college A lot of parents will also be happy to know that they have the option to use 529 assets to pay for up to $10,000 in tuition expenses (per beneficiary) at elementary, middle, or secondary public, private, or parochial schools. (Note that different states may have different restrictions.) Plus—and this is good news for parents and college graduates alike—up to $10,000 of 529 assets can be used to pay off existing student loans. So, wherever a student is on their educational path, a 529 can help ease the way. Flexibility to change beneficiaries Even if you don't use the funds for your son's education, you have other alternatives. You opened the 529 for the benefit of your son, but the account belongs to you, and you have the right to change the beneficiary. As long as the new beneficiary is a family member—a sibling, first cousin, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or even yourself—the money can be used for qualified education expenses without incurring income taxes or penalties. Qualified expenses include tuition, required fees, books, supplies, computer-related expenses, even room and board for someone who is at least a half-time student. Most 529 plans allow you to change the beneficiary once a year, so that leaves the door wide open for future use. You could even convert it back to your son's benefit should his plans change. This flexibility gives you a lot of options. Let's say you decide to go back to school. You make yourself the beneficiary and use 50% of the 529 assets for your studies. What do you do with the balance? You could simply change the beneficiary to another family member who could use it for their own qualified education expenses. The problem with taking the cash Cashing out your 529 is always a possibility, but it will cost you. If assets in a 529 are used for something other than qualified education expenses, you'll have to pay both federal income taxes and a 10% penalty on the earnings. (An interesting side note is that if the beneficiary gets a full scholarship to college, the penalty for taking the cash is waived.) Since one of the main benefits of a 529 account is the federally tax-free earnings, I'd think carefully before cashing it out. And, really, it might be wise to sit tight before making any decisions. Your son may surprise you again by going in a whole new direction, and you'll be glad you've kept those 529 assets in reserve. A word of encouragement While there may be some skepticism about the value of college these days, a 2019 report by the College Board found that higher education not only leads to greater employment opportunities and higher lifetime earnings, but it's also associated with a healthier lifestyle. Whatever your son's current feelings about continuing his education, I encourage you to keep talking to him about his interests and ways to develop his skills—for his financial future as well as his future happiness.

Now that I'm in my 30s and she's retired, I want to be able to help her out financially but in a way that also protects her sense of pride and independence. What do you recommend? —A Reader Dear Reader, As I've said many times, I'm all in favor of one generation helping another. That's usually interpreted to mean parents or grandparents helping the kids. But as people are living longer and experiencing longer retirements—with the corresponding drain on their nest eggs—I think it's wonderful when kids can turn the tables and help their parents. It especially makes sense if it's not a huge strain on the kids' finances. So it sounds like your mother is one lucky woman. Not only because you have the desire and means to help her, but also because you're sensitive to her feelings. And I think there are a number of meaningful ways to help her without making her feel uncomfortable. Share your financial know-how You might open the door by talking to your mom about your own finances, what you're learning and how you're managing. Talk to her about budgeting, saving, and how you make choices in your own financial life. That will give her the confidence that you're doing okay. The next logical step is to talk about her finances. What are her income sources? Does she have enough to cover her essential expenses such as housing, food and medical bills? What trade-offs does she have to make? By looking at her budget with her, perhaps you'll see places where she can make different choices so she doesn't have to skimp in one area or another. Helping her manage her money better will give your mother a greater sense of independence. At the same time, by reviewing all this with her, you'll be better able to see the areas where she might need a little extra help. Pinpoint one area where you're particularly interested in helping out If your mom is living on a tight budget, she may be denying herself something that you feel is essential to her well-being and safety. For instance, does she have adequate insurance coverage? What about a cell phone or internet connection? You could offer to pay for something practical like regular housecleaning or service on her car. Or maybe she'd really benefit from having a gym membership, but it would seem like an extravagance to her. Focus on something you think would improve the quality of your mother's life and tell her you'd really like to cover it for her; that rather than being a burden, it would make you feel good to do it. For instance, a friend of mine whose 85-year-old mother lives alone picked up the tab for a medical alert system. She phrased it as being as much for her own peace of mind as for her mother's. Pay for a special treat for the two of you In the same spirit, you could take your mom out to dinner on a regular basis, or perhaps plan and pay for a spa day or even a vacation together. By giving her a bit of luxury, you'll spare her having to budget for it. At the same time, you'll be showing her that it's not just about money, but also about spending quality time with her. Show continued interest in helping her stay on top of her finances Your interest in helping your mother is a valuable gift in itself. Especially if it's not a one-time event. As your mom gets more comfortable with having you involved in her financial life, make an effort to stay involved. Keep discussing your mutual finances, the transitions you each have to make at different times in your lives, and the continual choices that are necessary. And don't shy away from the difficult topics such as estate planning. For instance, make sure she at least has a basic will, durable power of attorney reference for financial matters and an advance healthcare directive. Having brought you up in a house full of love, rather than being put off, your mom will recognize that your concerns for her financial security come out of love. That should give her a real sense of pride. Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there! Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Health savings accounts (HSAs) are particularly prized for their triple tax advantages: Contributions are tax-deductible,1 earnings are tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free when used for qualified medical expenses. However, roughly 94% of HSA holders keep their accounts entirely in cash, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Account holders who don\\'t invest their HSA contributions could be missing an opportunity to earn tax-free returns. \"We generally suggest keeping two to three years\\' worth of routine medical expenses in cash, cash investments, or similar low-volatility investments within your HSA,\" says Rob Williams, Certified Financial Planner™ (CFP®) and managing director of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Then, any excess funds could be invested for potential growth—for two reasons: Given the likelihood that health care costs will be even higher in the future, doing all that you can to get ahead of them may be wise. Indeed, a 65-year-old couple retiring today can expect to need as much as $325,000 in savings to cover Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket costs.2 After age 65, you can use HSA funds for things other than health care. If you do so, you\\'ll pay only ordinary income tax on withdrawals with no other penalty—putting the funds on par with withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs. Add in the advantage that HSAs aren\\'t subject to required minimum distributions, and HSAs can be a compelling option for retirement savings overall. (Nonqualified withdrawals made prior to age 65 are subject to ordinary income tax plus a 20% early withdrawal penalty.) To contribute to an HSA, you must participate in an eligible high-deductible health care plan—often, but not always, offered through an employer. For an individual account, you can contribute up to $3,650 in 2022 ($7,300 for families), plus an additional $1,000 in catch-up contributions if you\\'re 55 or older. Once you have sufficient funds in the account—most require you to maintain a minimum cash balance—you can start to invest additional funds based on your risk tolerance, your time horizon, and, ideally, a diversified portfolio or other investment choices offered by your HSA administrator. 1 While HSA contributions are exempt from federal income tax, they are not exempt from state taxes in California or New Jersey. 2 Betsy Jaffe, \"Savings Needed for Medicare Beneficiaries\\' Health Expenses Declines,\" Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), 05/20/2021, https://www.ebri.org/docs/default-source/ebri-press-release/pr-1264-savingstargets-28may20.pdf?sfvrsn=5e993d2f_2.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'April tears It was quite a month. The S&P 500 was down nearly 9% in April, its worst month since March 2020, when the pandemic wreaked havoc with stocks. It was worse for the Nasdaq, which was down more than 13%, its worst month since October 2008, when the Global Financial Crisis wreaked havoc with stocks. Even more significant pain was felt by the \"Big 5\" largest stocks in major indexes [Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, and Tesla], which were collectively down nearly 20%, their worst month ever as a group. Amazon was in the crosshairs late last week, having announced that it had overbuilt during the pandemic, and is now experiencing waning demand…which may be a canary for broader consumption/inflation trends ahead. Peeling a layer or two of the market onion back, underlying weakness has been evident for quite some time—it\\'s just that lately, the largest-capitalization names have not been spared. Below is our crowd-favorite drawdowns table; and as shown, the average member drawdown from both year-to-date and 52-week highs is between -21% and -47%. In other words, the average member drawdown of -21% for the S&P 500 puts it in bear market territory, even though the index decline has skirted that moniker for now. Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 4/29/2022. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Some members excluded from year-to-date return columns given additions to indices were after January 2022. History\\'s lessons It\\'s the third-worst four-month start for the S&P 500 since WWII; while it\\'s the worst in the Nasdaq\\'s shorter history. Looking back at historically weak starts of at least or near this magnitude, average and median returns going forward were weaker than average. Volatility has been especially pronounced for the Nasdaq 100. Bespoke Investment Group (BIG) looked at its average daily moves since its inception in 1971, and there were only three periods with loftier readings: dotcom bust era around 2000; GFC era in 2008; and debt downgrade era in 2011. BIG also looked at the most-highly correlated years with 2022 so far. Of the 10 most similar, nine were after WWII. Again, subsequent returns were mixed-to-weak the following year. Based on the \"average\" patterns of the prior 10 periods, the S&P 500 tended to have further declines over the next 100 trading days, before starting to show signs of stabilization. As to whether the S&P 500 is on its way to an index-level bear market, the decline so far isn\\'t much of a \"tell\" based on history. BIG compared the S&P 500\\'s performance over the past 80 trading days to the first 80 trading days of prior post-WWII bear markets from all-time highs. In the vast majority of those prior periods, the index was down less from its all-time high than where it is now. Halitosis Market breadth statistics remain generally weak and \"out of gear\"—perhaps oversold enough to warrant a bounce, but not oversold enough to suggest the market has priced in the possible recession on everyone\\'s mind. However, since weakness has moved up the cap spectrum, that has allowed for some breadth improvement (the hard way) for the cap-weighted indexes. Leadership has also provided a tell in terms of the economy\\'s trajectory. The relative outperformance of traditionally defensive segments of the market relative to more cyclical segments has been in force since last summer. At the same time, some of the most speculation-driven segments of the market are again under significant pressure. Goldman Sachs-tracked baskets, including Retail Favorites, Most-Shorted, Non-Profitable Tech-and the De-SPAC Index, are down between 40% and 70% from their highs last year. In the market\\'s favor could be the plunge in attitudinal measures of investor sentiment (often a contrarian indicator at extremes) and the possibility that inflation could be in the process of peaking. Earnings have also been relatively strong, in aggregate (more on that below). But risk remains high that volatility bursts will persist, especially with the Federal Reserve set to hike rates aggressively over the next several months. GDP: emphasis on \"gross\"? Those in the recession camp got some fillip last week with the release of first-quarter real gross domestic product (GDP), although the report had something for economic bulls as well. At the headline level, growth (or lack thereof) was objectively weak: real GDP contracted at a 1.4% quarter/quarter annualized rate, the first decline since the second quarter of 2020. For what it\\'s worth, we think the odds point more toward recession than soft landing (where the Fed can raise rates, tame inflation, and keep unemployment low.) Of the past 13 rate hiking cycles, a recession has unfolded 10 times, with soft landings only three; as such, a recession is typically the \"safer bet.\" If the current period\\'s unique additives—a 40-year high in inflation, growth already weak as the Fed ramps up rate hikes, the simultaneous shrinking of the Fed\\'s nearly $9 trillion balance sheet, a pandemic that isn\\'t over and the Russia/Ukraine war—it arguably moves the needle more toward recession. Key to the ultimate answer is likely to be the labor market, which remains an important economic support. GDP details As shown in the table below, consumer spending increased by 2.7% and business investment increased by an impressive 9.2%. Both components undoubtedly kept real GDP from falling further, given the drag from net exports and inventories, which contributed -3.2% and -0.8%, respectively, was largely responsible for pulling the headline figure into negative territory (in addition to a negative contribution from government spending). Source: Charles Schwab, Bureau of Economic Analysis, as of 3/31/2022. *Represents contribution to percent change in real GDP. Numbers may not add up to 100% due to rounding. Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP based on annualized Q/Q % change. Those in the soft-landing camp may write off the short-term irregularities associated with the trade balance and inventory data, instead shifting focus to the relative strength of the consumer. The surge in imports was indeed a confirmation that shipping congestions continued to ease throughout the quarter, and though inventories have climbed in level terms, the rate slowed considerably (it was never expected to match the increase in the fourth quarter of 2021). The economically bearish take is that negative inventory contributions may persist for longer than expected. Inventories as a component of GDP are calculated as the change in the growth rate as opposed to the change in the stock; if businesses are unable to boost stockpiles at the same rate as in the prior quarter, there will be a net negative effect. If that persists alongside a slowdown in consumption, there is likely further downside to headline growth. A balanced view of growth in the first quarter is that consumption\\'s pace has slowed, business investment remains incredibly strong (a plus for the supply side of the economy), and the fiscal drag persists. What helped keep the economy afloat in the depths of the pandemic was a double-barreled boost from both fiscal and monetary policy; yet the math is such that we now have a double-barreled tightening from the reversal in (or now lack of) stimulus. In conjunction with the surge in inflation, that will put downward pressure on growth, incomes, and spending. A note on the \"strength\" of the consumer The 2.7% increase in first-quarter consumer spending is not to be discounted, as consumption helped keep growth from diving lower. Worth noting, however, is that consumer spending does not need to turn negative for the broader economy to weaken or even enter into a recession. As shown below, consumer spending never contracted during the 2001 recession, contracted for only one quarter in the 1981-1982 recession, and was even positive for one quarter in 2008 (as the financial crisis unfolded). Acute observers will note that the narrative of the strong consumer is not always the elixir for the economy; broader macro forces can at times be powerful enough to supersede spending. Consumption\\'s boomerang Source: Charles Schwab, Bureau of Economic Analysis, as of 3/31/2022. Y-axis truncated at +25% and -15%. Also worth emphasizing is both the trend in spending and the reason it moved up in the first quarter. Real consumption improved in March relative to February, assuaging some fears that the second quarter started on weak footing. However, March\\'s 0.2% gain was down considerably from the 1.5% gain in January. Not only that, but the savings rate fell to 6.2% in March (the lowest since 2013), a 2.2% drop from the end of 2021. That indicates that consumers dipped into their savings to maintain their spending throughout the quarter, which isn\\'t surprising given the sharp increase in inflation. Should that trend continue, however, there may be less slack for consumption to continue to boost growth; and while business investment remains strong right now, the future is murkier with an aggressive Fed, supply chain disruptions failing to dissipate, and margins coming under pressure. Regardless of whether recent economic weakness is the marker of a recession on the horizon, investors should be keenly aware that growth is slowing. Not only have the effects of the pandemic relief/stimulus, post-vaccine reopening, and pro-cyclical inflationary boom worn off, they have turned into headwinds. Beat it As noted, first quarter 2022 earnings season so far has provided decent news, at least in the aggregate. Of the 279 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings per share (EPS), more than 80% have beaten consensus estimates—compared to a long-term (since 1994) average of 66%, but a prior four-quarter average of 83%. In aggregate, companies have reported EPS 6.7% above estimates—compared to a long-term average of 4.1%, but a prior four-quarter average of more than 13%. On the negative side, there have been 75 negative EPS pre-announcements issued by S&P 500 companies compared to 27 positive, which puts the negative/positive ratio at 2.8 (significantly higher than normal). On a more positive note, the window for stock buybacks has reopened, which could provide a boost to EPS. As shown below, the \"blended\" growth rate (combining already-reported earnings with consensus expectations for those not yet reported) for the S&P 500 is now more than 8%, with Energy leading the sector pack and Financials bringing up the rear. From there, earnings are expected to slow to about 6% in the second quarter before rebounding in the second half. We can say for certain that these growth rates will not prove to be accurate—but whether the bar remains set too low will largely be dependent on the trajectory of the economy from here (obviously).

In sum It\\'s been a mixed-to-weaker bag in terms of macro drivers and we expect significant bouts of volatility to persist. Based on the initial report, the economy contracted in the first quarter, but consumer spending remained relatively healthy. Although inflation may have peaked, it\\'s unlikely to decelerate quickly, putting increasing pressure on the consumer looking ahead. Investor sentiment, as measured by surveys, has turned pessimistic, which could provide some support for stocks; however, behavioral measures of sentiment do not yet show a \"washout,\" or full-scale capitulation. Last year was a story of pro-cyclical (or demand-pull) inflation, while this year it\\'s turned into a story of counter-cyclical (or cost-push) inflation. The pressure associated with the latter should be somewhat proportional to the power of the former, which suggests even if some measures of inflation have peaked, the negative economic consequences are likely not yet in the rearview mirror. This is not a time for investors to take on risk outside the parameters of their strategic asset allocations. It is a time for investors to employ traditional disciplines around diversification (across and within asset classes), to focus on quality in terms of stocks\\' fundamentals, and to stay in gear via periodic rebalancing. In the case of rebalancing, it\\'s one of the investment world\\'s greatest disciplines, as it forces investors to adhere to a derivative of the adage, \"buy low, sell high,\" which is: add low and trim high.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Ouch. If you were to summarize the start of the year for municipal bonds in one word it would be that—ouch. This has been the worst start to a year in roughly three decades, but the good news is the sharp selloff has finally created some opportunities that haven\\'t existed in years. Returns for all major muni categories are down for the year Source: Components of the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index, as of 4/27/22. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Surging Treasury yields drove the sharp decline in prices, because bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. Inflation is at multi-decade highs and the pivot by the Federal Reserve to aggressively hike rates sent the 10-year Treasury yield up more than 130 basis points since the end of 2021 (one basis point equals 0.01%). Short-term yields are up even more, with the two-year Treasury rising 186 basis points. Yields are up significantly since the start of the year Source: Bloomberg, as of 4/27/22. AAA munis are represented by the Bloomberg BVAL Curve and Treasuries are represented by the US Treasury Actives Curve. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For income-oriented investors, the rise in yields is welcome because over the past decade, yields have rarely been as high as they are now. Municipal bonds are generally not subject to federal and potentially state income taxes, and therefore usually pay lower yields than comparable, taxed bonds. One common method to adjust for this difference is to look at the \"tax-equivalent yield,\" or the pre-tax yield a bond would need to be equal to the yield of a tax-advantaged bond. As illustrated in the chart below, the yield to worst for a broad muni index is over 3%. This compares to a tax-equivalent yield of 5.8% for an investor in the top tax brackets. In other words, a fully taxable bond that yields 5.6% would yield the same as a municipal bond that yields 3% for an investor in the top tax bracket. The tax-equivalent yield for munis is above 5.6% for investors in the top tax bracket Source: Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index, as of 4/27/22.

Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Munis may yield more than Treasuries after taxes Relative to other fixed income investments, muni yields are attractive, too. One common metric to analyze the relative attractiveness of the muni market is the municipals over bonds (MOB) spread. It\\'s a ratio of the yield on a AAA muni to that of a Treasury before considering the tax benefits that munis offer. Since the start of the year, the MOB spreads for most maturities have been steadily climbing and are now above their five-year averages. Valuations have improved steadily throughout the year Source: Bloomberg, as of 4/27/22. BVAL AAA Muni Yield as a % of Treasury 10 Year (MUNSMT10 Index). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Munis are attractive relative to corporate bonds, too Throughout most of 2021 and the early part of 2022, a muni investor needed to be in the very top tax brackets for munis to yield more than corporate bonds of similar maturities after taxes. With the recent rise in yields, that\\'s no longer the case. An investor in the 22% tax bracket can now achieve a higher after-tax yield with munis compared to corporate bonds. Munis yield more than corporates for investors in the 24%-and-above tax brackets Source: Bloomberg Municipal Bond and Bloomberg Corporate Bond Index. As of 4/27/22.

Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. The risk of widespread muni defaults is low, in our view Although prices have fallen, it\\'s largely due to rising interest rates and not credit concerns. As a result, we believe the risk of defaults in the muni market remains low. The ongoing economic recovery, combined with the multiple rounds of federal aid, have helped bolster most state and local governments\\' finances. Tax revenues have surged and rainy day funds (a pool of money a state can use under certain circumstances) are also at record highs, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. Generally, states have used rainy day funds to help counteract the negative impact of declining revenues. In addition to surging revenues and stronger rainy-day balances, the risks posed by underfunded pension liabilities have declined. This is due to states and local governments increasing contributions and enacting reforms, in addition to strong stock market returns. Nationally, state pension funds are 80% funded, which is considered to be a fully funded plan. Funded ratios vary by state, however. The ongoing improvement in credit conditions has boosted muni ratings. Over the past four quarters, Moody\\'s has upgraded more muni issuers than they have downgraded. Even Illinois, New Jersey, and Connecticut—often considered three of the more financially troubled states—have received credit rating upgrades for their general obligation bonds. Ratings upgrades have outpaced downgrades over the past four quarters Source: Moody\\'s Investors Services, as of 2/15/22. Based on number of ratings changes. Consider extending duration As painful as the recent move up in yields has been, we believe the worst is likely already behind us. At the start of the year, the market was anticipating the Fed would only increase the federal funds rate to slightly below 1%. That\\'s now shifted to roughly 2.75% this year. Consequently, yields have jumped in anticipation of Fed tightening. We believe that a lot of the tightening is already being discounted by the market. Because we believe the worst of the rise in yields is behind us, we suggest investors extend their duration. (Duration is a measure of how much a bond\\'s price will change based on fluctuations in interest rates.) For reference, the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index has a duration of 5.3 years. Moreover, the current shape of the yield curve signals that extending duration is attractive. The yield curve is a plot of yields relative to the years to maturity. We found that when the difference in yields between two- and 10-year Treasuries is between zero and 50 basis points, longer-duration munis have historically performed well over the following 52 weeks, as illustrated in this chart. As of April 22, 2022, the 2/10s spread was roughly 23 basis points. Longer-duration munis have historically performed well when the yield curve is flat Source: Bloomberg and the components of the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index using weekly data from 1/2/98 to 4/16/21. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. The favorable economic backdrop supports selectively taking on some credit risk Given the current favorable economic outlook, we suggest adding some lower-rated (A/A and Baa/BBB) issuers in moderation. In addition to the positive economic backdrop, valuations favor lower-rated munis relative to alternatives. For example, a generic five-year BBB rated muni yields roughly 3.4%, versus a comparable five-year BBB rated corporate bond that yields 3.9%. After considering the impact of taxes, an investor would only need an \"all-in tax rate\" of at least 14% for the corporate bond to yield the same as the municipal bonds. An \"all-in tax rate\" is a combination of federal, state, and other applicable taxes. Risks to our view A risk is Treasury yields continue to rise and munis follow suit, resulting in additional price declines. Another risk is the potential for a recession in the near term due to the Federal Reserve tightening policy too much. A slowdown in economic activity, combined with rising unemployment, would likely result in lower tax revenues for state and local governments. As a result, they would have less financial flexibility to meet debt service. A recession in the near-term is not our base case, but the risks are rising. What to do now Despite the rough start to the year, the move up in yields has created opportunities. Investors who own mutual funds or ETFs and want to consider our guidance and add some lower credit quality munis should review the mutual fund or ETF\\'s portfolio composition. This is on the \"Holdings\" page for the respective fund on Schwab.com. Look for funds that have a larger portion of their holdings in A/A and BBB/Baa rated munis relative to their benchmark. For reference, the chart below shows the ratings composition of the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index. A word of warning: With BBB rated issuers, nearly half of the BBB portion of the index is made up of only 10 issuers, which can make liquidity or finding enough issuers for adequate diversification potential challenges for that segment of the market.

       "   'abstract': 'The 2022 Schwab-Ariel Black Investor Survey shows both progress and opportunities for addressing wealth inequality.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, You\\'ve heard me talk about the importance of getting more people invested in the stock market before, but to me it can\\'t be overstated. And the earlier people start, the better. Einstein has famously declared compound growth to be the 8th wonder of the world, but to benefit you have to get—and stay—invested. Then you not only have the chance to participate in the dynamism and drive of businesses that make our economy thrive, but you also have the chance to build your own wealth and financial security. Because I believe so strongly that investing can open doors to greater financial opportunities, I was heartened but also concerned by the results of the latest Ariel-Schwab Black Investor Survey on Black middle-class investors. On the positive side, the gap in stock market participation between Black and white investors has narrowed and Black investors are saving and investing more in 2022 than they did in 2020, largely driven by people under 40. But there are some trends that show we still have a way to go in helping people prepare themselves to take full advantage of the opportunities investing can provide. Here’s my take on the key findings: 1. A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing Among both Black and white Americans, more than four in ten admitted to investing in something they didn\\'t fully understand. And Black investors are more than twice as likely to trust social media as an information source on investing than white investors (13% vs. 6%). Even more concerning, risky investments like cryptocurrency are increasingly popular, particularly with younger Black investors, with nearly a third of Black investors believing that crypto is regulated by the government—which is not the case. With the potential for financial loss and volatility, anyone interested in cryptocurrency should approach it as a speculative investment, best suited to someone who already has a diversified portfolio and a long-term investment plan. The jury may still be out on the role crypto can play in your portfolio, but if you ask me, the verdict is in regarding the dangers of FOMO, social media and financial illiteracy. Clearly more needs to be done to help people get the financial knowledge and develop the skills to confidently identify facts, decide what information sources are reliable, and understand how to compare choices and assess risks. 2. Return expectations are unrealistic Hand-in-hand with the appetite for risky investments is the desire to \"get rich quick\" through investing. When asked about anticipated investment returns, more than one in four Black investors (27%) expect annualized returns of 20% or higher, compared to only 12% of white investors. Black investors under 40 have even higher expectations, with 34% expecting returns of more than 20%, compared to 15% among white investors of the same age. In contrast, analysts at Charles Schwab Investment Advisory project U.S. large company stocks to return an average of 6.4% annually over the next 10 years. International large company stocks are estimated to return slightly better at 7.5% over the same time period. 3. Trust is still an issue Black investors cite a lack of trust in the stock market and financial institutions as a reason for not investing. On the plus side, Black investors who do engage with financial institutions say they feel more respected now than in the past. Even so, Black Americans report a lower likelihood than white Americans to rely on financial advisors with 51% doing so in 2022 compared to 58% in 2020. In general, Black investors are less trusting of people and more trusting of technology. 4. Investing with your values is important Investing using an additional lens of Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) or Socially Responsible Investing (SRI)— in effect, doing well by doing good—is increasingly popular for Black and white investors. And as in 2020, Black investors are even more interested than their white counterparts in aligning their investments with their personal beliefs, with 44% vs. 29% saying it\\'s very important. One of the things I personally like about investing according to your values is that it makes investing more \"real.\" As a result, individuals may be more likely to stay engaged with their investments. I\\'m particularly excited by the expansion of thematic investing through mutual funds, ETFs, and fractional shares that allow individuals to align their investments with their interests and values. 5. Financial literacy is a priority Both Black and white investors largely agree that increased financial literacy is one of the best ways to help address wealth inequality (83% vs. 74%). An overwhelming majority of respondents—regardless of race—agree that financial literacy should be required in public schools (93% of Black Americans vs. 92% of white Americans). This belief in the importance of financial literacy is reflected in an increase in \"dinner table conversations\" about investing among both Black and white families. Why I\\'m optimistic As divided as we are on various issues today, I\\'m probably the most heartened—and optimistic—about this wide agreement that financial literacy needs to be a priority. I\\'ve always believed financial literacy is an essential life skill that should start at home, continue through school and at work and never stop. And I see it happening in many areas of society. According to our survey, more families are discussing money at home today than in the past. Nearly half of all states now require high school students to take a course in personal finance to graduate. More employers than ever are offering financial education as part of workplace benefits. And it\\'s through this increased focus on financial literacy that I believe we can counter some of the misinformation and unrealistic expectations about investing that still exist. I think the survey shows that our industry has a lot more to do to help more people get invested and stay invested, particularly new investors, those with low wealth, or systemically disenfranchised individuals and communities. But working together with schools, employers, nonprofits and regulatory bodies, we can do it. Just imagine—greater financial security through increased financial literacy and more people benefiting from markets and the economy. Now that would get my vote for the 9th wonder of the world!

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Given this backdrop, investors are naturally concerned about their fixed income investments. In our view, there are still risks in the market, but rising interest rates may also provide opportunities for income investors. The following are some of the most frequently asked questions we\\'ve received this year. 1. Why were bond returns so bad at the start of 2022? Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, so rising bond yields sent prices lower. High inflation and the Federal Reserve\\'s pivot to a more aggressive approach to rate hikes were the main culprits for the surge in yields. The two-year Treasury yield rose more than 180 basis points this year through April 19th, with the five-year Treasury yield up 160 basis points. Treasury yields are up sharply this year Source: Bloomberg, using daily data as of 4/19/2022. US Generic Govt 2 Yr (USGG2YR Index) and US Generic Govt 5 Yr (USGG5YR Index). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance of short-term bonds might have caught investors off guard. While short-term bonds are less sensitive to rising rates than long-term bonds, the magnitude of the rise in yields resulted in poor performance across the board, including short-term bond investments, whose prices have historically been more stable. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index suffered its worst quarterly decline since 1980. Nearly every domestic bond index we track suffered a loss in the first quarter of the year. Consider the one- to three-year Treasury index total return. As illustrated below, it is down 2.5% this year. For this index to continue to deliver such a low return over the next three and a half months, the two-year Treasury yield would need to rise as much as it has already, which is unlikely in our view. Even short-term Treasuries are down this year Source: Bloomberg. Total returns from 12/31/2021 through 4/18/2022. Total returns assume reinvestment of interest and capital gains. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 2. If the Federal Reserve keeps hiking rates, won\\'t prices keep falling? Possibly, but we believe the magnitude will be significantly less than the price declines already experienced this year. The bond market is forward-looking and yields tend to rise in anticipation of changes to the federal funds rate. We\\'ve already seen that happen, especially with two-year Treasury rates. If the markets are right and the Fed does hike rates to the 3.1% area, there\\'s not much more upside with short-term Treasury yields, especially compared with the recent rise. The two-year Treasury yield is approaching the mid-2023 expected fed funds rate Source: Bloomberg, using daily data as of 4/19/2022. US Generic Govt 2 Yr (USGG2YR Index) and Federal Funds Target Rate Mid Point of Range FDTRMID Index). The 3.1% expected fed funds rate for June 2023 is based on the fed funds futures market, as of 4/19/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The relationship is slightly different for long-term bonds. While short-term Treasury yields tend to be driven directly by changes in the fed funds rate, long-term Treasury yields have a more indirect relationship. Since 10 years is a long period of time, the 10-year Treasury yield doesn’t necessarily move along with each hike (or cut) to the fed funds rate. Rather, the 10-year Treasury yield tends to adjust based many factors, such as where the fed funds rate is expected to be in the future and how long it will stay there, as well as expectations for inflation and economic growth. Historically, the 10-year Treasury yield has often peaked near a cycle\\'s peak fed funds rate. Although the market is pricing in a steep rise in the fed funds rate (to more than 3% by mid-2023), it is also discounting rate cuts in late 2023 and 2024. With the 10-year Treasury yield approaching 3%, there doesn\\'t appear to be much upside with 10-year Treasury yields, either. There are risks, of course. If our outlook is wrong, and the Fed tries to fight inflation by hiking rates more than markets expect, there may be more upside with long-term yields. The yield increases would be accompanied by price declines. The 10-year Treasury yield tends to peak near the peak fed funds rate Source: Bloomberg, using daily data as of 4/19/2022. US Generic Govt 10 Yr (USGG10YR Index) and Federal Funds Target Rate Mid Point of Range FDTRMID Index). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 3. Are bond mutual funds or ETFs a good investment in this environment? For certain investors, bond mutual funds or ETFs are an appropriate investment even though rates are rising. A fund is simply a portfolio of individual bonds. Unlike an individual bond, bond funds generally don\\'t have a maturity date, so investors don\\'t know the value they\\'ll receive in the future. Unfortunately, income returns have not been enough to offset the decline in prices of most bond investments this year. But if we are correct in saying that much of the bad news has been priced into the market at current yields, then prices may begin to stabilize or improve going forward. Meanwhile, income payments will continue; they may even rise for bond funds as fund managers rebalance in a rising-rate environment. Total return breakdown: price vs. income returns Source: Bloomberg. Total returns from 12/31/2021 through 4/13/2022. Indexes represented are the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index (Investment Grade Corporates), Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index (High-Yield Corporates), ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index (Preferred Securities), Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (U.S. Aggregate), and the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index (U.S. Treasuries). Total returns assume reinvestment of interest and capital gains. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no indication of future results. When looking at the gain or loss of a bond fund, keep in mind that it usually only considers the change in price, not any income received or reinvested. To get a more accurate measure of what the total return is, consider income as well. 4. Shouldn’t I wait until the Fed hits its peak rate before I invest? It may be tempting to sit in very short-term investments while the Fed is hiking rates, but that could mean missing out on today\\'s higher-income opportunities. For example, consider a money market fund that yields roughly 0.25%. That yield should continue to rise as the Fed hikes rates, but a five-year Treasury yield already offers a yield of 2.6%. To match that Treasury\\'s average yield, the hypothetical money market fund yield would have to rise by roughly 120 basis points a year, each year (for example, from 0.25% today to 1.45% in year two, and then a similar increase over the next three years) for the incomes to match over a five-year period. 5. What part of the yield curve is the most attractive? The Treasury yield curve is the line that plots the yields of Treasuries of all maturities, starting with very short-term maturities and ending at 30 years. As the chart below illustrates, the yield curve is steep from three months through two years, but then it\\'s very flat from two years through 30 years. Yield curve snapshot Source: Bloomberg, as of 4/19/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. We suggest investors gradually extend the duration of their bond holdings to benefit from the increase in yields. Duration is a measure of how prices will change relative to changes in interest rates. How far to extend will depend on the investor\\'s objectives and risk tolerance. To do this, consider a bond ladder. Bond ladders can be another way to take advantage of rising rates while not trying to time the market. Schwab clients can use the CD & Treasury Ladder Tool to build your own bond ladder online. 6. The yield curve is very flat and inverted in some places —should I be worried? Historically, inverted yield curves have preceded recessions, so any time the curve flattens as much as it has this year, recessions warnings begin to make headlines. The time between when the yield curve inverts and the next recession has varied. More importantly, the fixed income and equity market performance during those periods has varied, meaning it\\'s not a reliable investment signal. Inverted yield curves don\\'t necessarily cause recessions—rather, they are symptoms of tight financial conditions that can slow growth. For example, the yield curve last inverted in August 2019—months before the COVID-19 pandemic began. Fast-forward to February 2020 and the U.S. economy experienced the shortest recession on record due to the COVID crisis—not because the yield curve inverted the year before. The slope of the yield curve represents what the markets expect short-term rates to average over time. The yields on maturities of two-year Treasuries and beyond have converged between 2.5% and 3%, consistent with the market estimate of the Fed\\'s \"neutral rate.\" The good news is that the short-term slope, a key indicator for Federal Reserve officials, is still steep. While risks to economic growth are rising, we\\'ll be more concerned when we see the short-term slope flatten or invert. 7. What are potential opportunities in the bond market today? Given our outlook that yields are near their peak, investors should consider locking in those yields now by considering intermediate- or modestly longer-term bonds, in moderation. For those who prefer to stay in cash, consider moving out to two- or three-year Treasuries. It\\'s not our preferred strategy, but we know a lot of investors likely don\\'t want to come off the sidelines until they feel more confident about inflation declining. Instead of waiting for cash or money market fund rates to rise, investors can potentially earn 2.5% or more and get paid to wait. For those willing to take a little extra risk, intermediate-term investment-grade corporates appear attractive—the average yield of the intermediate-term corporate bond index is now 3.7%. With an average duration of 4.4 years, the index is still subject to price declines if yields rise, but the duration is well below the average duration of 7.8 years of the broad corporate bond market, meaning less interest rate risk. For investors in higher tax brackets, yields on municipal bonds look especially attractive. The Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index offers a yield of nearly 2.9%, which is the equivalent of a roughly 5.9% taxable yield for an investor in the top tax brackets. In addition, we believe credit risk in the muni market is low due to the multiple rounds of fiscal aid Washington gave state and local governments in an effort to support the economic recovery during the pandemic. For those willing to take a bit more risk to earn higher yields, preferred securities appear attractive. Prices have been hit hard by the double whammy of surging long-term Treasury yields and stock market volatility. However, aside from the pandemic-driven plunge in March 2020, average prices have rarely been lower, and the price plunge provides a relatively attractive entry point. The sharp rise in yields has created opportunities for income-oriented investors Source: Bloomberg. As of 4/18/22. Indexes representing the investment types are: Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (LBUSYW Index), Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Index (LUACYW Index), Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index (LUACYW Index), Bloomberg U.S. Municipal Bond Index (LMBIYW Index), Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index (LF98YW Index), Bloomberg Global Aggregate ex-USD Bond Index (LG38YW Index), Bloomberg Emerging Markets USD Aggregate Bond Index (EMUSYW Index), ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index (P0P1 Index), and the Bloomberg U.S. Securitized Index (LD19TRUU Index). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 8. I\\'m worried about inflation, what can I do? Consider Treasury-Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS. TIPS are indexed to the consumer price index, so their principal values and coupon payments rise and fall with the level of inflation. There are a few considerations for TIPS investors: TIPS yields are negative. That shouldn\\'t be too much of a surprise since nominal Treasury yields are negative after adjusting for the level of inflation today. If you invest in a TIPS with a negative yield and hold to maturity, you lock in a \"real\" or inflation-adjusted loss. Nominal returns can be positive, however, depending on the rate of inflation. TIPS can offer inflation protection over the long run, but not necessarily over the short run. TIPS prices and yields move in opposite directions, just like traditional bonds. Over the short run, price movements in the secondary market may offset the inflation adjustment. For example, the consumer price index rose sharply in the first three months of this year, but the Bloomberg U.S. TIPS Index still lost 3.5%, since the rise in yields/drop in price offset that inflation adjustment. As the chart below illustrates, TIPS prices are down sharply this year—enough to offset the inflation adjustment. TIPS prices have declined, offsetting the CPI adjustments Source: Bloomberg, using daily data as of 4/18/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Breakeven rates are high. A breakeven inflation rate is the difference between the yield of a TIPS and the yield of a nominal Treasury with a similar maturity. That rate is what inflation would need to average over the life of the TIPS for its total return to break even with the total return of the nominal Treasury. Breakeven rates are near all-time highs, which isn\\'t too surprising given the current rate of inflation. But if you think that inflation will remain elevated for years—and higher than the breakeven rates shown above—then TIPS can still make sense. What to do now? We don\\'t believe the performance of the fixed income markets in the first part of the year is a reason to abandon fixed income. The move up in yields has created opportunities we haven\\'t seen in many years. For help selecting the solutions for your situation, consider reaching out to a Schwab representative.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Stock prices and bond yields have been moving in opposite directions this year. It is possible that bond yields may soon level off after the rapid climb in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to near 3% from 1.5% at the start of 2022. Yet, stock market investors may still desire ways to hedge against the risk of any further rise. Short duration stocks In the bond market, favoring shorter duration bonds may provide some protection against rising rates. Likewise, in the stock market, short duration stocks may provide a hedge against rising yields. The duration of a stock is defined as the average time until its cash flows are received, weighted by their present values. In other words, when markets pursue a theme driven primarily by rising interest rates, it tends to favor stocks with more immediate cash flows (shorter duration) and punish stocks that are expected to deliver a higher proportion of cash flows in the distant future (long duration). Unlike bonds, which are debts with regular payment schedules, stocks represent ownership of the company and cash flows can be irregular and not guaranteed. To measure duration for stocks we use the price to cash flow ratio. By ranking the stocks in the MSCI World Index by this ratio, we can see that short duration stocks (the 20% of stocks with the lowest price to cash flow) continued to outperform the overall market and their long duration counterparts (20% of stocks with the highest price to cash flow) in April, as they have since interest rates began to rise in August 2020. Short duration stocks outperforming long duration stocks Source: Charles Schwab, FactSet data as of 4/20/2022. High price to cash flow = top 20% of stocks ranked by price to cash flow in MSCI World Index. Low price to cash flow = bottom 20% of stocks ranked by price to cash flow in MSCI World Index. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Falling rates pose a risk Short duration stocks dramatically outperformed both long duration stocks and the overall MSCI World Index when bond yields climbed from their low in August 2020. However, short duration stocks lagged the overall index and their long duration peers when yields retreated slightly (from April through December of 2021), highlighting a risk to this theme.

Finding potential opportunities Low price to cash flow stocks can be found in all sectors and countries. But they tend to be more concentrated in the indexes of international markets. Although 39% of the 1,539 stocks in the MSCI World Index are U.S.-based companies, U.S. stocks make up 59% of long duration stocks and only 31% of short duration stocks. The remaining short duration stocks (69%) are international companies. Short duration stocks are more prevalent internationally Source: Charles Schwab, FactSet data as of 4/20/2022. Based on stocks in MSCI World Index. Balancing sector exposure When using a filter, like low price to cash flow, to find stocks that may fare better in an environment of rising interest rates, it is also important to consider diversification across sectors. An equal-weighted portfolio only consisting of the 20% of stocks with the lowest price to cash flow contains stocks from all sectors, but would lead to sizable underweights in information technology and health care, with overweights in materials and financials, relative to the MSCI World Index.

For investors considering hedging some of the risk of higher interest rates in their stock portfolios, the mindful addition of short duration stocks may be an effective way to manage risk while remaining invested in the markets.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My husband and I own a small vacation home. Since we only use it now and then and it\\'s so easy to rent through sites like Airbnb or VRBO, we\\'re thinking of doing that to make some extra income. What does this mean for taxes? —A Reader Dear Reader, With short-term online rentals now ubiquitous—not only for vacations but also as \"work from wherever\" locations—more and more people are earning extra income by renting out their property part-time. However, while this can seem like an easy and practical thing to do—and the income can be a real boon—the tax rules can be mind-numbingly complex. In this column, I\\'m going to talk exclusively about renting out a vacation home—but you should be aware that the rules are different if you rent out your primary residence (or even part of it). And while I can give you some basics, I urge you to talk to your tax advisor so you understand exactly how the rules apply to your situation. You might also want to consult IRS Publication 527 for more detail. I don\\'t mean to suggest you shouldn\\'t give it a try. Just be aware of the rules before you start the process so you know what you\\'re getting into. Here are some key points to consider. The amount of time you rent out your home Rental income in general is taxable. But the IRS gives you a small break if you rent your vacation home for 14 days or fewer in a year. In this case, your rental income is tax-free. You don\\'t even have to report it on your tax return—no matter how much it is. Of course, this also means you can\\'t deduct any of the expenses from renting the property on your tax return. If you go past the 14-day limit, you have to report your rental income and are subject to paying taxes on it. On the plus side, you can deduct rental expenses. But here\\'s where it starts to get complicated because the amount of expenses you can deduct depends on whether the property is considered a personal residence or a business in the eyes of the IRS. And that depends on the proportion of personal use to the amount of time you rent the property. Here\\'s how it works. Your property is considered a personal residence if you use it for more than the greater of 14 days OR 10% of the days it\\'s rented. On the flip side, if you use the home less, it is considered a business property. What constitutes personal use To make things a bit more confusing, the definition of personal use includes not only days you use the property but also days your family members use it, days you may have donated the use of the house, or days you rent it out for less than fair market value. So if you give your out-of-town relatives a generous break on the rent or donate two weeks to a local charity auction, that time would be considered personal use. On the other hand, the days you spend at the house doing maintenance do not count as personal use. If you spend a weekend, a week, or even a month fixing up the property, that time is off the books. Expenses that can be deducted when renting a personal residence The reason all of this is important goes back to taxes and expenses. If the property is considered a personal residence, you may be able to itemize and deduct things like mortgage interest and property taxes. But when it comes to expenses, you have to apportion eligible deductible expenses (i.e., cleaning, repairs, utilities) according to the amount of personal or rental usage. To determine the percentage of expenses you can deduct, you divide the number of days rented by the total number of days of usage (personal days plus rental days). Let\\'s say you spent the month of June (30 days) at your vacation home. You\\'ve passed the 14-day limit. Even if you rent it out for 90 days the rest of the year, it\\'s still considered a personal residence. To figure out what percentage of expenses are deductible, you\\'d divide 90 by 120 to get 75%. Therefore, you could deduct 75% of eligible expenses up to the total amount of the rental income. If your expenses exceed the rental income, you can\\'t take a loss on a personal residence, but you may be able to carry excess expenses forward to the following year. Expenses that can be deducted if your rental is considered a business If you limit your personal use and your rental is considered a business, you may be able to deduct all eligible rental expenses and deduct losses up to $25,000 in the current or future tax years. In addition, you can recover the cost of income-producing property by depreciating the part of the property used for rental purposes. Bear in mind, though, that depreciation reduces your basis for figuring gain or loss on a later sale or exchange. In other words, a lower basis will potentially subject you to higher capital gains tax when you sell the property. State and local taxes and other rules State and local laws vary on sales taxes or hotel taxes even on short-term rentals. So you\\'ll need to look into your own state and local government requirements. Also, it\\'s prudent to check with your local authorities on permitting and HOA rules before renting out your property. Lastly, be sure to check with your homeowner\\'s insurance provider to understand how renting out your home might affect your coverage. What to expect come tax time Rental services like Airbnb generally submit a 1099 to the IRS reporting your rental income. So be sure to keep good records of your rental income as well as fees paid to the rental service and all your expenses. If you\\'ve rented out your home for more than 14 days, you generally have to file Schedule E with your income tax return. As I said, the rules can be complicated but don\\'t be discouraged by the details, just be prepared. And do talk to your tax advisor to make sure you have it all under control.

       "   'abstract': 'Ever wonder if you’re on track to reach your retirement goal? Here’s how to calculate how much you should have saved by now.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Knowing how much to save for retirement is a two-fold challenge. First, it's difficult to estimate your expenses—and thus, your income needs—for a retirement that's years, if not decades, away. Second, even after you settle on a target portfolio size, it's hard to gauge if you're saving enough to reach that goal. To bring some clarity to this retirement-savings conundrum, we've developed a guide to help you estimate how much you should have in your retirement portfolio today based on your age and income. Once you've determined whether your portfolio is on track, behind, or ahead, you can act now to make sure you achieve your retirement goals. Calculating your target savings Retirement looks different for everyone. But assuming you'll maintain the same lifestyle in retirement that you currently enjoy, you can calculate how much you should have saved by now using your annual income and an appropriate multiplier based on your age, which you can find in the following table. Annual income multiplier range by age Annual income multiplier range by age To find your multiplier, go to the row with the age closest to your own and use the multiplier given in the column to the right. If you find yourself between ages, consider averaging the lower-age and higher-age multipliers. If your income is less than $100,000, focus more on the lower end of the annual income multiplier range. If you earn more than $250,000 or want to be more confident that your savings can withstand unexpected retirement expenses, think about using a higher multiplier. Current age Annual income multiplier Current age 30 > Annual income multiplier 1X > Current age 35 > Annual income multiplier 2–3X > Current age 40 > Annual income multiplier 3–4X > Current age 45 > Annual income multiplier 4–6X > Current age 50 > Annual income multiplier 6–8X > Current age 55 > Annual income multiplier 7–10X > Current age 60 > Annual income multiplier 9–13X > Current age 66 > Annual income multiplier 11–16X > Source Schwab Center for Financial ResearchThe underlying calculations use forward-looking Capital Market Expectations (CMEs). An income range between $50,000 and $300,000 was used to test different effects on the multiplier rate. Income is assumed to steadily increase with inflation at 2.47% annually. Retirement savings is assumed to begin at age 25 and end at age 66. From our research, the target savings rate is used as an assumption—based on a range of 15% to 20% of annual income—and represents what someone would need to contribute to the portfolio from age 25 to 66. Retirement is assumed to last 30 years. Initial retirement income withdrawal is based on needing 50% to 66% of the current income determined by reducing the current annual income by the target savings rate and hypothetical Social Security benefit amount at full retirement age taken at age 66 for the income range tested. Retirement portfolio income is based on a sustainable, initial withdrawal rate calculated by simulating 1,000 random scenarios using a 75% probability of success. Probability of success is calculated as the percentage of times where the portfolio’s ending balance was greater than $0. Portfolio follows an age-based glidepath during the savings period, ending with a moderate portfolio. The initial withdrawal amount, in dollars, is increased by an annual inflation rate of 2.47%. Let's look at a couple of scenarios. Scenario 1 Ruth is 45 years old and makes $265,000 annually. Based on the table, her current estimated retirement portfolio should be around 4–6x her income, or around $1,060,000 to $1,590,000. Since her earnings are on the higher end of the income spectrum, she should consider comparing her current portfolio value to the higher estimate. Scenario 2 Alan is 53 years old and has an income of $100,000. Because Alan is between ages in the table, he could average the multiplier ranges for age 50 (6–8x) and age 55 (7–10x) and use 6.5–9x to calculate his target savings, making his current estimated retirement portfolio around $650,000 to $900,000. If Alan plans to splurge on travel in retirement, then he might consider focusing on the higher end of the estimated portfolio range. Remember, these multipliers are meant to be a quick guide to help approximate where your estimated retirement savings should be at a certain age. For more specific recommendations and guidance, seek professional help. Do you need to adjust your retirement savings plan? Once you know whether you're behind target, on track, or ahead of target to reach your retirement savings goal, here's what to do next: If you're behind: Don't panic—but do take action. Save more now: It's the most obvious—and probably the most difficult—solution, but the sooner you boost your savings, the longer your money has to potentially benefit from compound growth. Increase your annual contributions and remember to save at least enough to capture your full employer match, if offered. Reassess your goal: Can you live on less? Some expenses may go away in retirement, such as commuting costs or a mortgage payment. Stay flexible: Don't get discouraged. If you work a few years longer, or if you work part time in retirement, you may not need to tap your portfolio for income right away. That could also help delay Social Security, which could boost your benefit by as much as 8% per year after you reach full retirement age. If you're on track: Keep up the good work. Continue making contributions and rebalance your portfolio regularly. Max out your retirement accounts: If you're age 50 or older, in 2022 you can contribute up to $27,000 to a 401(k) and up to $7,000 to an Individual Retirement Account. (Those under 50 can contribute up to $20,500 and $6,000, respectively.) Stick with stocks: Your portfolio should become more conservative as you near retirement—but not too conservative. Consider maintaining at least some exposure to stocks to capture market growth but not so much that you lose sleep should the market stumble. If you're ahead: Congrats! Stay focused and maintain your cushion. Keep saving: Continue saving as much as you can for as long as you can. You never know when life—or the market—will throw you a curveball. Review your assumptions: Are you planning to retire early? Are you planning to spend more in retirement? Are you not planning on other income sources in retirement like Social Security or a pension to supplement your savings? Make sure your savings align to your retirement vision. Get a second opinion No matter where you are on your journey to retirement—but especially if you're falling behind on your savings—working with a financial planner is a great way to pressure-test your retirement assumptions and create a realistic plan.

       "   'abstract': \"We've made progress in teaching our nation’s teens about money, but there's much more to do.\",\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, For the last 20-plus years, April has been designated as Financial Literacy Month—and for good reason! As is the case every year, I welcome the opportunity not only to acknowledge the progress we\\'ve made as a country, but also to shine a bright light on our continuing and urgent need to do even more. A recent report from the Council for Economic Education (CEE) provides an in-depth analysis of the slow but steady improvement in offering personal finance education in our schools. But as parents and concerned citizens, it\\'s important to understand that we can’t just hand over the job to our kids\\' schools. We, too, can play an essential role in educating our children about money, hopefully before they assume complete responsibility for their financial futures. Finding the best time to start I\\'m often asked, \"How early is too early to teach kids about financial literacy?\" or \"What\\'s the best age to teach financial literacy?\" That\\'s hard to answer definitively not only because every child is different (even in the same family!), but also because it\\'s almost never too soon to start to lay a foundation for future learning. Children as young as age four or five begin to understand basic concepts of numbers. When they\\'re in elementary school, they become more comfortable with how numbers work and learn basic arithmetic. In middle school, they can then apply this knowledge to more abstract concepts like compound growth and diversification and start to develop skills in planning and decision making. But lately, I\\'ve been thinking that the sweet spot for taking on financial literacy in a more substantial way is around the teen and high school years. Here\\'s why—and how you can help more kids get access to high quality financial education. Getting to them while they\\'re getting going I see the teen years as the prime time for several reasons. First, although some teens wean themselves from their parents\\' finances faster than others, most have some money of their own, whether that\\'s from a part-time job, allowance, or gifts. And there\\'s nothing like having skin in the game to make their education more meaningful. Second, by the time a child is in high school, they likely have the math skills to calculate and appreciate not only the positive power of compound interest but also the negative impact of paying fees and interest on credit card debt. Many teens will be able to grasp the tradeoff between risk and reward and apply that concept to building an investment portfolio. Others are born entrepreneurs and will be ready to start applying their skills to building a business. The third reason isn\\'t skill-based, but more a reflection of their developmental stage. Teenagers are observers. And they\\'re vulnerable. Many are wired to experiment, push boundaries, and test limits. Others are super cautious and need to be encouraged to flex their risk muscles. Either way, they all have to learn how to deal with new situations and uncertainty in a productive way. Learning about money—from budgeting to saving to borrowing to investing—is all a part of the process of developing the skills they need to become an independent adult. We\\'re making strides, but need to do more I\\'m excited that 23 states now require students to take a course in personal finance to graduate high school but that leaves too many that still don\\'t. And we need to do more to provide training and resources for more teachers. This is especially true for teens who live in under-resourced communities. Schools in wealthy communities are much more likely to teach financial literacy. That\\'s just a fact. But kids from low- and moderate-income families need a solid financial education just as much, if not more. All kids deserve access to high-quality financial education to build a future of financial security and opportunity. That’s why I\\'ve been proud to partner with organizations such as CEE, Donor\\'s Choose, Boys & Girls Club of America, Next Gen Personal Finance, Operation HOPE and Girl Scouts of America who offer great programs in financial literacy to help level the playing field. And with the introduction of Moneywise America, Schwab pledges to make financial literacy available to high schools and neighborhoods across America. As a company, we see it as our mission to help prepare every teen in America to achieve financial freedom by filling the education gap too many schools and communities struggle to address. The right way to reach teens You don\\'t have to be a financial expert to help educate your kids. Here are a few things to keep in mind: Don’t lecture. Instead, use stories and share your experiences. As much as you think appropriate, share your family\\'s situation, including your budget, savings, insurance and investments. Take money out of the closet. Encourage your teen\\'s questions. Nothing should be off the table. Walk the talk. Kids watch what you say and do. Often the unspoken messages are the most powerful of all. Make concepts and examples relevant to their lives. Having a savings or investing account, an allowance, or making them an authorized user on a credit card all are ways to help your teen learn by doing. Be careful with implicit and explicit biases when talking to girls. Help your daughter become as strong as any of her male counterparts by giving her the same skills and knowledge to succeed. Discuss your values. So much of money management has to do with our personal priorities, so show your teen how they can connect the two. Fancy car or college fund? Expensive vacation or helping an aging parent? Include your teen in these important decisions. Don\\'t be afraid to say \\'I don’t know.\\' Seek out the answer together! Other ways you can help In addition to educating your own children, there are many outstanding organizations that can let you become involved and advocate for financial literacy in your own community: https://www.councilforeconed.org/policy-and-advocacy/toolkit/ https://checkyourschool.org/ https://gflec.org/education/fast-lane/ I\\'ve been advocating for financial literacy for most of my career for the simple reason that I see it as one of the most powerful ways to build a more equitable world. Please join me in honoring Financial Literacy Month by helping to educate the children in your home and in your community. Our collective future will be better for it.

       "   'content': 'The \"end of globalization\" is a phrase that has come up a lot lately. Stories written about deglobalization have hit a fevered pitch with the war in Ukraine. But they began to heat up six years ago as that summer\\'s Brexit referendum resulted in the British voting to leave the European Union. As you can see in the chart of \"deglobalization\" appearing in major news stories below, authors have attributed the potential end of world trade growth to: Brexit in 2016; President Trump\\'s trade policy in 2017; The rise of Nationalism in 2018; The pandemic in 2020; The war in Ukraine in 2022. Yet, none of these have led to a decline in world trade. In fact, global trade hit a new all-time high this year after climbing steadily throughout the past six years, despite the brief \"V\"-shaped disruption in response to the pandemic lockdowns. Hot topic Source: Charles Schwab, CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, Bloomberg data and news search of major publications as of 4/8/2022. Politics vs. economics For decades, globalization described an economic concept, but more recently it has become blurred with a political concept. Separating the two ideas is important to understand the impact on investors. Now, making such a distinction may not apply to Russia, since the country has decoupled from the rest of the world both politically and economically. But that is the exception. The U.S. and China, who have seen significant political decoupling, remain tightly intertwined economically. Brexit was primarily a political decoupling of the U.K. from the EU, not an economic one—as highlighted by U.K. imports from the EU recently hit their second-highest-ever level in January 2022 (the latest data point available). Even though the pandemic prompted politicians in major economies to tout new sources of domestic supplies of goods deemed essential, the trends in cross-border trade in vaccines, personal protection equipment, and ventilators remain largely unaltered. Despite the political deglobalization, we\\'ve seen no pickup in new construction of domestic manufacturing facilities to allow for economic deglobalization. The U.S. has seen no growth in such spending in either dollars or as a percentage of GDP even as the stories of the end of globalization piled up in recent years. As you can see in the chart below, spending on the construction of new manufacturing facilities has remained rangebound between $5 and $8 billion since 2015. How would more domestically made goods be produced? Source: Charles Schwab, U.S. Census Bureau data retrieved from Bloomberg as of 4/9/2022. Measuring trade Some would argue that the value of world trade was stalling prior to the pandemic. When focusing on the economics of globalization it is important to look at the volume of global trade, since the value of trade can be impacted by many factors that can be misleading. The chart below shows that world trade momentum measured in dollars appeared to stall from 2008 through 2020, even as the volume of trade advanced steadily. World trade volume vs. value Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 4/9/2022. We don\\'t believe that politics stalled the dollar value of trade. Overall, tariffs and non-tariff barriers to global trade were lowered, not raised, according to actions tracked by the World Trade Organization. In fact, the dollar amount of world trade rose 21% during the Trump administration from January 2017 to January 2021, rebounding from the oil-related downturn in 2015-16, and then surged during the pandemic. There were two major causes of the stall in the U.S. dollar value of global trade growth from 2008-2020: The oil market acted as a drag on global trade. Fuel made up 16% of global exports in 2008 and fell to just 11% in 2019, before the pandemic. This 5% drop in oil trade took place as world growth became less dependent on fossil fuels and U.S. oil supply rose and eliminated the country\\'s dependence on fuel imports (which once made up nearly half of the U.S. trade deficit). When measuring global trade in U.S. dollars, the appreciation of the dollar weighs on the dollar value of trade, independently of the unit volume. Merchandise trade volume grew 17% from January 2008 to January 2020, according to the widely watched World Trade Monitor, prepared by the Netherlands Bureau of Economy Policy Analysis. But when observing trade by value, a rising dollar appeared to erase that gain. The broad trade-weighted value of the U.S. dollar rose 35%, from 95 to 128, from mid-2008 to the end of 2019. As a result of these distortions, looking at world trade volume instead of its dollar value tends to be more insightful in identifying the trend in globalization. Globalization evolves The idea of economic globalization defined as the sourcing of production in one country with the lowest labor cost and exporting the final product to be sold everywhere else is now outdated. With the advances in robotics and other manufacturing technology, labor has a smaller cost input to manufactured products. Equipment miniaturization and localization of manufacturing has allowed for multiple redundant supply chains as well as local customization for products sold around the world, generating profits for companies independent of where they are headquartered. Sales and profits remain globalized even as the goods being sold may rely less on cross-border transportation. The rapidly growing digital economy takes globalization even further. Services were once hard to export, and goods made up the vast bulk of international trade. But now, cross-border data traffic is exploding and services such as software, apps, video games, music, and video can all be produced and distributed virtually anywhere. Those who view globalization from only a political perspective may be surprised. Future developments in drivers of economic globalization may have different impacts: Countries seeking domestic renewable energy supplies may act as a drag on global trade in energy resources, but global sourcing of green technologies being adopted may be a potentially significant offset. As an example, the MSCI Alternative Energy Index is made up of producers of green energy solutions from around the world (ex. U.S. 32%, Denmark 21%, China 16%, Canada 6%, India 4%). The localization and vertical integration of supply chains within emerging-market economies has likely reduced some cross-border trade in intermediate goods. What this means is that a larger portion of overall supply chains are falling within one country moreso than in the past, and therefore products cross borders fewer times during the manufacturing process. The impact of these business decisions can be observed by the falling share of intermediate goods exports relative to final goods exports, especially in China. Yet, this may be offset by scope for a finer division of supply chains in frontier markets like Africa, South America, and less-developed parts of Asia. Ultimately, history shows that global trade grows in sync with global economic growth. It pulls back in recessions and grows during expansions. Of course, there will also be other unknown factors yet to emerge and influence the trend in global trade. Does it matter? The political deglobalization taking place in recent years might not matter that much to investors. It didn\\'t result in a stall in the sales of multinational companies nor a decline in the international portion of those sales. As overall sales have climbed, the international share has remained consistent at around 40% for companies in the U.S. and Europe and around 55% for companies in Japan, according to data from FactSet. Percentage of sales generated internationally Source: Charles Schwab, FactSet data as of 4/8/2022. Share of domestic sales for S&P 500 and MSCI Japan Index and share of European region sales for MSCI Europe Index per FactSet GeoRev data. Political deglobalization could lead to some reshoring of industries deemed essential and some companies linked to national security issues may be impacted. But political deglobalization may have little impact on economic globalization or corporate profits—the main driver for stock market returns over the long-term. This likely means there is little reason for investors to deglobalize their portfolios, despite the headlines.

       "   'content': 'The first quarter was brutal for fixed income investors. Rising interest rates, spurred by surging inflation and a sharp turn toward tightening by global central banks, sent prices down and yields up. It was one of the worst quarters for fixed income in decades. Rates are higher across most of the curve Source: Bloomberg, The change in yields from 12/31/2021 to 4/4/2022. A basis point is 1/100th of a percent, or 0.01%. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. As painful as it was, we see the selloff creating opportunities for investors. The steep rise in yields should mean that income investors can finally earn relatively attractive yields in the bond market after enduring nearly three years of near-zero interest rates. While it may seem counterintuitive to buy bonds just as the Federal Reserve embarks on a policy tightening path, we believe that much of the bad news is already discounted. The risk/reward in segments of the bond market has improved significantly. Market has priced in a fast, steep tightening cycle by the Fed A lot has changed in the past few months—mainly the Federal Reserve\\'s policy stance. Until December, the Fed was focused on the potential negative economic fallout from the pandemic and was cautious about exiting its very easy policy stance. The stronger-than-expected recovery, along with the spike in commodity prices due to Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, forced the Fed and other central banks to shift toward tighter policy. Consequently, yields jumped across the curve, led by a steep rise in short-term rates. Yield curve snapshot Source: Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2022, 12/15/2021 and 4/2/2021. Yield curve signals The market is now discounting a fast pace of Fed rate hikes, with the federal funds rate expected to reach as high as 3% in early 2023. Considering that the Fed has only raised rates once, a lot of future rate hikes are already being discounted by the market. It\\'s important to note however, that the market is also discounting a few rate cuts in 2024. Yields are now converging between two-year to10-year maturities. They are currently above the Fed\\'s longer-run estimate of the \"neutral rate\" of about 2.5%—the rate that is low enough to support economic growth but high enough to keep inflation in check. In past cycles, when the yield curve flattens near the neutral rate, it has been near the peak in long-term rates. The spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields has narrowed Source: Bloomberg. Daily data as of 4/5/2022. Note: The rates are composed of Market Matrix U.S. Generic spread rates (USYC2Y10). This spread is a calculated Bloomberg yield spread that replicates selling the current two-year U.S. Treasury Note and buying the current 10 year U.S. Treasury Note, then factoring the differences by 100. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. In the past few weeks, parts of the Treasury yield have inverted. Ten-year yields are lower than five-year yields, and the much-watched two-year/10-year yield spread dipped into negative territory briefly. Yield curve inversions raise concerns because they have historically preceded recessions. However, the Fed watches short-term rates more closely. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the \"near-term forward spread\" is a key indicator for Fed policy makers. The spread is the difference between the current three-month T-bill yield and where the market is pricing the expected three-month yield 18 months from now. That difference is still very wide, signaling that the Fed has ample room to raise rates. The near-term forward spread remains steep Source: Bloomberg. Fed Near-Term Forward Spread (FEDNTFS Index). Daily data as of 4/5/2022. Note: The near-term forward spread is the spread between the yield on a 3-month Treasury bill and a 3-month Treasury bill 18 months from now. When the near-term forward spread starts to narrow, the Fed is likely to slow its pace of tightening. The faster the Fed moves in the short run to get near its neutral rate, the more likely it is that the spread will flatten or narrow. The Fed is also expected to announce it will begin reducing the bond holdings on its balance sheet in May. This process—known as quantitative tightening or QT—is another way for the Fed to tighten policy by reducing the flow of liquidity to the financial system. What about inflation? The biggest concern for fixed income investors is inflation. Although it\\'s likely to remain high in the near term due to rising commodity prices, we expect it to ease later in the year—providing some relief for bond investors. The economy is showing signs of cooling off after a sharp rebound from pandemic lows. It appears that a lot of consumption was likely pulled forward by the combination of easy fiscal and monetary policies last year. Now the pace is moderating, especially in key areas where in financing costs are rising—like capital expenditures and housing. The pace of core capital goods orders is slowing Source: Bloomberg. Capital Goods New Orders Non-defense Ex Aircraft & Parts. Monthly data as of 2/28/2022. Note: This concept tracks the value of new orders received during the reference period. Orders are typically based on a legal agreement between two parties in which the producer will deliver goods or services to the purchaser at a future date. The housing market is feeling the pinch of higher interest rates. Mortgage applications for purchases and refinancings have dropped sharply and new home sales have fallen from peak levels of 2021. It appears that the housing boom may be over. Since a lot of consumption has been tied to the housing market, the slowdown is significant. Mortgage applications drop as mortgage rates move up Source: MBA mortgage applications (MBAVCHNG Index) and Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey, U.S. 30-year FRM. Monthly averages as of 3/31/2022. Long-term inflation expectations have increased only modestly You wouldn\\'t know it from reading the financial news or listening to the most hawkish central bankers, but inflation expectations appear reasonably contained. The markets are discounting high inflation in the near term, but also an aggressive tightening cycle that will pull it lower longer term. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey indicated that near-term inflation expectations are high and continue to rise. Not surprisingly, short-term inflation expectations tend to be highly correlated with oil and gasoline prices. However, despite the steep rise in prices recently, five-to-10-year inflation expectations are sitting at 3%, which happens to be the long-term average dating back to the 1990s. In other words, consumers don’t expect this inflation spike to last at the elevated rates we\\'ve seen recently. Short-term inflation expectations the highest level since 1981, but long-term inflation expectations remain near 3% Source: Bloomberg. University of Michigan 1-year inflation expectations (CONSEXP Index) and 5-10 year inflation expectations (CONSP5MD Index). Monthly data as of March 2022. Inflation is a policy choice, and the major central banks are choosing to bring it down. This is probably one of the most important considerations for investors right now. In major countries with independent central banks, inflation is the result of policy decisions. Central banks have the tools to target an inflation range. Currently, central banks around the globe (with a few exceptions like Japan and China) are choosing to drive inflation lower. Even Europe, where the war in Ukraine is having a negative impact on growth, tighter monetary policy is in the works. In the U.S, the Fed has clearly signaled it wants inflation to come down and will do \"whatever it takes\" to lower it. The Fed can\\'t do much about the supply side shocks lifting inflation, but it can depress demand. To achieve a more stable supply/demand balance, the Fed\\'s focus will be on creating \"slack\" in the economy. By raising the cost of money and reducing reserves in the banking system, the Fed can slow growth. That probably means higher unemployment on the horizon as slower consumer spending and capital investment mean fewer jobs. Since inflation is a lagging indicator, the impact of the tightening now is likely to show up in the next six to 12 months. Opportunities for income We are finally getting positive on the outlook for intermediate to long-term bonds. After spending the better part of the past few years suggesting investors keep average portfolio duration low due to the risk of rising yields, we are now in favor of adding duration (that is, some slightly longer-term bonds), and selective credit risk. What changed? Yields and the stance of Fed policy. The risk/reward has improved now that yields have jumped up and the signs from the yield curve suggest the peak in yields for the cycle may be getting closer. There may be some more upside in yields if inflation proves more stubborn than we expect, but with the Fed all-in on bringing it down and the curve flattening, the collective wisdom of the market is suggesting that yields are likely to plateau or move down. Yields aren\\'t as low as many investors likely assume Source: Bloomberg, as of 3/25/2022. Indexes represented are: HY Corporates = Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index; EM USD Bonds = Bloomberg Emerging Market USD Aggregate Index; Preferreds = ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index; IG Corporates = Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index; MBS = Bloomberg U.S. MBS Index; U.S. Agg = Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index; Municipal bonds = Bloomberg U.S. Municipal Bond Index; Treasuries = Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Index; and Dividend Aristocrats = S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. Yields shown are the average yield-to-worst, except for the Dividend Aristocrats which is the average dividend yield. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Risks to our outlook Inflation and growth could continue to surprise on the upside, causing estimates of the \"neutral rate\" to rise. It\\'s more likely to happen if central banks turn cautious and don\\'t follow through on tightening than if they continue to be hawkish. Watch what happens in the yield curve for signs of any slippage in expectations. It would show up in a steeper yield curve and rising inflation expectations. The other caveat is that while nominal yields have risen sharply, real yields are still low or negative. We expect real yields to rise as the Fed tightens and inflation expectations subside. But it would make us more comfortable to see real yields in positive territory as a starting point. Consequently, we\\'re constructive but focused on seeing inflation cool off later in the year to validate our market expectations. Real yields are still negative Source: Federal Reserve and Bloomberg.

Nonetheless, we are growing more constructive on the fixed income market for the first time in a few years. It may be a bumpy ride, but current yields in many areas of the market are high enough to make taking more duration and/or credit risk worthwhile. Look for opportunities We suggest investors gradually begin to increase the average duration in their portfolios as yields move higher. For income investors, we favor investment grade corporate bonds and preferred securities. At current yields, we believe the risk/reward has improved considerably. Investors in higher income brackets should consider munis since credit risk remains low in our view and the recent rise in yields has substantially improved valuations. As the cycle of tightening global liquidity plays out, we suggest being cautious about riskier segments of the markets. Central banks are trying to tighten financial conditions to reduce inflation and that is often associated with greater volatility in lower credit quality, less liquid markets.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'What began in 2009 with a single virtual currency—Bitcoin—has grown to comprise some 16,000 cryptocurrencies totaling more than $2.4 trillion in assets.1 But know this: All that virtual activity has real-life tax consequences. \"If you make money on a cryptocurrency transaction and don\\'t report the income, you could be in hot water,\" says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Let\\'s look at how cryptocurrencies are taxed—and how to avoid running afoul of the IRS. Buyer beware The IRS treats cryptocurrencies as property, meaning sales are subject to capital gains tax rules. Be aware, however, that buying something with cryptocurrency also counts as a sale because you\\'re effectively selling a portion of your holdings to cover the cost of the purchase. \"People don\\'t think of shopping as a taxable event, but it can be if you use virtual currencies,\" Hayden says. Whether the transaction results in a gain or a loss is calculated by taking the difference between the fair market value of the goods or services you receive and your adjusted cost basis—that is, the amount you paid for your cryptocurrency, plus any fees. For example, if you use one bitcoin to purchase a $45,000 car but that bitcoin was worth only $40,000 when you purchased it, the transaction would result in a $5,000 gain. Had the bitcoin originally been worth $50,000, the transaction would result in a $5,000 loss, which potentially could be used to offset capital gains or taxable income in the same calendar year. Play it safe Under current law, the cryptocurrency owner is responsible for reporting all transactions to the IRS. \"You\\'re not going to get a Form 1099 from the currency exchange, so it\\'s on you to keep receipts and confirmations for every purchase and sale,\" Hayden says. Moreover, if you can\\'t prove your adjusted cost basis, you must report it as zero—meaning the entire sale will count as a gain. \"Whether intentional or not, any instance of underreported income is considered tax evasion, so be sure to take it seriously,\" Hayden says. If you\\'re not sure how to report transactions properly, work with a tax advisor—and potentially file an amended return for any past missteps. 1Coinmarketcap.com, as of 12/27/2021.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'When you go offline and can\\'t be reached—whether it\\'s due to a health matter, natural disaster, traveling with limited cell reception or Wi-Fi, or just taking a break from technology—you need someone who can relay messages to and for you. Especially where your finances are concerned, planning for the unexpected should include identifying the people with whom your financial institution can communicate if you\\'re ever unavailable. What is a trusted contact? A trusted contact is someone who can: Confirm your current contact information Confirm your health status Confirm the contact information for other authorized parties Discuss urgent, unusual account activity or other possible red flags It\\'s important to note that trusted contacts are unable to act on your behalf, execute transactions, or engage in account activity unless they\\'re already an authorized party on your account. What are the benefits of having a trusted contact? While you may not be required to have a trusted contact, establishing one may help your financial firm move more quickly and decisively when addressing suspected fraudulent activity. You may already have a power of attorney or spouse listed on your account, but a trusted contact provides an additional resource to reach out to if an issue arises. Who can be a trusted contact? In most cases, anybody who\\'s at least 18 years old can be a trusted contact, but we suggest designating a person who isn\\'t already authorized to conduct business or receive information on your behalf. Trusted contacts are usually family members or close friends—people you trust and who are likely to be in the best position to know your current situation—as opposed to your investment advisor, trustee, or power of attorney. How many trusted contacts can I have? The number of trusted contacts can vary by financial firm (Schwab allows two). Trusted contacts are often applied to your entire relationship with your financial institution, so you don\\'t have to worry about naming individual contacts for each account.

       "   'content': 'Many retirees risk outliving their retirement savings. The reason? Either failure to save enough—or to plan ahead. While many of us understand the need to set aside a portion of our income on a regular basis for our golden years, far fewer have a plan for determining if they\\'ve saved enough to retire and a strategy to convert those savings into a lasting income. In fact, only 54% of planners and 18% of non-planners are confident that they\\'ll achieve their financial goals.1 Creating income during retirement may sound daunting, but it doesn\\'t have to be. We recommend doing so in four simple steps: plan, invest, distribute, and monitor. In this article, we\\'ll take you through the first, and arguably most important, one: planning—including how much you\\'ll need during retirement and assessing whether you\\'ve saved enough when the time comes. Your life, your plan First, start with a vision—and projection—of your retirement finances. No two retirements are the same. Your plan should encompass your vision: What are your goals, and what resources will you need to meet them? Here are three basic questions you should ask as you begin the planning process: How much will you need to spend to achieve your goals? How much do you expect to earn from your savings, Social Security, and other potential sources of income? What will you do if your savings fall short? 1. How much will you need to spend? One school of thought says you\\'ll need 75% to 80% of your current income to maintain your present standard of living. That\\'s because some costs—such as mortgage payments or work-related expenses like clothing and commuting—are expected to decrease or go away altogether. However, while some costs may be reduced, others—such as travel, entertainment, and health care—may increase. Therefore, it might be safer to assume you\\'ll need roughly the same level of annual income that you earn now minus other potential sources of income, such as savings and Social Security. As an example, let\\'s say you earn $100,000 a year before taxes and are saving $10,000 a year toward retirement. Based on the 75% to 80% rule, you\\'d need between $75,000 and $80,000 a year in retirement. But it\\'s safer to assume that you\\'ll need $90,000 annually—that is, $100,000 minus the $10,000 you are currently allocating to retirement savings—all things being equal. How much of your current income will you need? Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research Another approach is to create a detailed budget by breaking down anticipated expenses into two groups: Essential expenses, or those you can\\'t live without, such as food, health care, and housing. Discretionary expenses, or those that are nice to have (not need to have), like entertainment, restaurants, and travel. If you own your home, you should also budget for expenses like major appliance replacements and other improvements and repairs that may be required during your retirement. You might also include possible one-time expenses, such as moving or taking that dream trip you\\'ve been putting off. A detailed budget can be more meaningful, and helpful, near retirement. 2. How much retirement income can you expect? Once you have an idea of how much you\\'ll need to spend, you can begin to calculate whether you\\'ll have enough resources. First, tally up any earnings you expect to receive from pensions, Social Security, and any other sources of income—separate from your savings. Then, subtract that amount from your estimated expenses to determine how much income will need to come from your portfolio.

For example, let\\'s say you\\'re shooting for $90,000 in annual spending. Assuming your nonportfolio income amounts to $30,000 a year, you\\'ll need $60,000 a year from your portfolio. Gauging your annual retirement portfolio income Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research According to our research, a portfolio that\\'s roughly 25 times as large as the amount needed for your first year of retirement has a very high likelihood—if invested appropriately—of lasting 30 years or more under most market scenarios, even with increasing your withdrawals each year to give you a pay raise and keep up with inflation.2 With that 25x target in mind and an annual portfolio withdrawal of $60,000, a portfolio value of $1.5 million—supplemented by non-portfolio income—would support your retirement spending. Calculating your retirement savings goal Although the so-called \"25x rule\" is a target, if you\\'re nearing retirement and haven\\'t saved this much, don\\'t panic. We see the guideline as a conservative rule to provide high level of confidence that savings will last. It\\'s always a good idea to consult a financial planner to create your own personalized financial calculations and plan—particularly as you approach retirement. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research Although the so-called \"25x rule\" is a target, if you\\'re nearing retirement and haven\\'t quite reached your savings goal, don\\'t panic. This guideline is a conservative rule to provide a rough sense of whether your savings will last the average 30-year retirement. It\\'s always a good idea to work with a professional who will take your current situation into account to create a personalized, more nuanced retirement transition and income plan—especially as you near retirement. 3. What if your savings fall short? While some investors will find themselves on target, others will discover that they may not have saved as much as they would have liked. If you experience the latter, here are several ways to adjust: Step up your saving Contribute the maximum to your 401(k). Contribute to an individual retirement account (IRA). Contribute to a SEP-IRA if you\\'re self-employed. Make additional catch-up contributions if you\\'re over 50. Earmark bonuses, raises, and tax refunds for retirement. Consider waiting Work longer to help preserve your savings. Work until you\\'re eligible for Medicare to avoid the expense of private coverage. Wait to collect Social Security. You can begin collecting benefits as early as age 62, though it will be reduced by 25%–30% compared with your full retirement age (between 66 and 67). Once you attain full retirement age, every year you wait up to age 70 increases your benefit by 8%. Consider a phased retirement that includes part-time work to help reduce the need to file for Social Security payments before full retirement age and to reduce withdrawals from your portfolio. Prioritize Reduce discretionary spending by separating \"nice to haves\" from \"need to haves.\" Cover \"need to haves\" with proceeds from pensions, Social Security, and other relatively reliable sources of income whenever possible. During retirement, prioritizing spending is helpful too. In a down market, you can reduce discretionary spending to help savings last. Periodic check-ins It\\'s important to remember that retirement-income planning isn\\'t a \"set it and forget it\" exercise, especially in the years just prior to retirement and after retirement begins. Rather, a retirement plan that goes beyond the general guidelines suggested here should be a working document that is reevaluated at least annually to account for any changes to inflation, investment returns, life expectancy, spending, and taxes. This may sound like a lot of work, but by planning today, you can confidently count on going the distance tomorrow. Following a plan, but remaining flexible, can help make your savings last so that you can enjoy your retirement. 1Charles Schwab, Charles Schwab Modern Wealth Survey 2021 (Logica Research, 2021), https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schwab_modern_wealth_survey_2021_findings.pdf. 2This is a general estimate only.

       "   'abstract': 'The pros and cons of different methods for leaving a home to your heirs.',\n",
       "   'content': 'When it comes to estate planning, a family home can be among the most valuable—and complicated—assets to pass down. \"It\\'s perfectly natural to want to see a cherished home stay within the family,\" says George Pennock, director of trust services consulting at Charles Schwab Trust Company. \"But you need to think about not only your own needs and wishes but also those of your heirs.\" For example, your child may love the family home and all the memories that go with it, but does he or she actually want to live there? If you have multiple heirs, is it realistic for them to co-own the property, or will such an arrangement create conflict? You also need to consider the role the house will play in your later years. \"Do you plan to stay in the home, or is it possible you may need or want to move at some point?\" George asks. \"All of this factors into how—and whether—you transfer the property to your kids.\" With that in mind, here are three ways to pass along a home to your heirs—both during and after your lifetime. 1. Sell it If you\\'re looking to move or put your home\\'s equity to use elsewhere, selling the home to a child or other heir could be a good option. Doing so removes the property from your taxable estate and establishes a new cost basis—meaning the capital gains on any future sale will be calculated using the value of the home on the date of the transfer rather than your original purchase price. Although you might be tempted to sell the home at a low price, be careful not to go below its fair market value. Otherwise, the difference between the sale price and the market value could be subject to gift taxes. 2. Gift it As generous as it is to gift a home to an heir during your lifetime, it could have negative tax repercussions. That\\'s because such a gift counts toward your lifetime gift tax exemption. That might not seem like an issue now that the combined gift and estate tax exemption is $12.06 million for individuals ($24.12 million for married couples) in 2022, but that number is set to come down by half starting in 2026, if not sooner. If that happens, such a gift could result in a federal estate tax of up to 40%, depending on the size of your estate. State-level gift, estate, and inheritance taxes could also be a factor, depending on where you live. The tax consequences could be even more severe for your heirs, especially if you give your home to your child during your lifetime—such as through a deed transfer. If your child decides to sell the home, the cost basis will be calculated using your original purchase price, potentially increasing the capital gains. 3. Pass it down Generally speaking, there are three methods for leaving a home to your heirs: Last will and testament: You can use your will to designate to whom the home should go and in what proportions. That said, wills are required to go through probate—the sometimes lengthy and often costly legal process of validating your will—which can slow down the transfer of ownership to your heirs. Transfer-on-death deed: If probate is a concern, you may be able to sign a transfer-on-death deed—available in 29 states and the District of Columbia—which allows you to pass the property to your heirs outside probate upon your death. Trust: Another way to avoid probate is to transfer the property into a living trust, which has the benefit of allowing you greater control over how the property is managed and under what conditions it can be sold. The home would remain part of your estate until your death, at which time it would pass to your heirs outside probate. However generous your intent, George warns that the bequest of a home can be an albatross if not accompanied by additional funds to help cover improvements, insurance, maintenance, and taxes—particularly if you plan to leave it to multiple heirs. \"You don\\'t want to make your kids house rich and cash poor,\" George says. \"Nor do you want them fighting about the costs of ongoing maintenance and upkeep.\" In such cases, setting aside funds in a trust dedicated for this purpose can help ensure the home is well maintained for years to come. Regardless of the method you use to pass down the home, it will receive a new cost basis upon your death, meaning any capital gains taxes resulting from a future sale would be calculated using the fair market value at the time of the transfer. Talk it out Whether you sell, gift, or pass down your property, the transfer could trigger a reassessment of the home\\'s property taxes, so be sure to factor that into your plan—ideally with the help of an attorney or a tax advisor. In addition to consulting financial professionals who can help you put your plan in place, you\\'ll want input from anyone affected by your decision. \"The most important thing you can do is to make sure all family members are part of the conversation,\" George says. \"That way, everyone has the chance to see their needs and wishes reflected in the plan for your home, which can avoid unnecessary conflict down the road.\"'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I'm in my late 30s. For the last several years I worked full-time as an employee of a company, but last year decided to go solo, mostly doing freelance work but also filling in as a rideshare driver. I love the independence and flexibility but I'm worried about staying afloat financially. What steps should I take to support myself long term? —A Reader Dear Reader, The timing for your question couldn't be better. A record number of people are rethinking their careers and the growing gig economy is a reflection of that. According to recent statistics, there are currently more than 59 million gig workers in the U.S., and more than 90% of Americans say they'd consider freelance work or independent contracting. Understandably, the main reasons are freedom, flexibility and control. But while there's a lot to be said for independence, like most things, when there's more freedom there's also more responsibility. As an employee, you often have the security of employer-sponsored benefits like health insurance and retirement plans. Consider that benefits average around a third of a typical employee's compensation. When you're your own boss, it's all up to you. Not only do you have to budget carefully to cover everyday expenses—and ideally live below your means—you have to shore up your savings as you think long term. Here are some steps I suggest you take right away to increase your financial security. Set up an emergency fund Everyone—independent contractor or not—should have an emergency fund in case of an accident, illness, or absence from work. This means setting aside cash in an easily accessible account to cover a minimum of three to six months of essential living expenses. I'd aim for six months or more, if possible. Earmark this money specifically for an emergency and promise yourself you won't touch it until absolutely necessary. Make sure you have the right insurance Health insurance is number one. It may seem like a big expense, especially if you've had coverage through an employer in the past, but consider that a single hospital stay could wipe you out. You can enroll in coverage through healthcare.gov if you’re a freelancer, consultant, independent contractor, or other self-employed worker with no employees. If your business has even one employee (other than yourself, a spouse, family member, or owner), check out SHOP Marketplace for small businesses. At the very least, get a high-deductible policy for yourself that would cover a catastrophic health event. Next, look into liability insurance. Regardless of how conscientious you are, things can go wrong. Make sure you have protection that covers you personally and professionally. For example, ride-sharing may not be covered by your personal auto policy. And finally, research disability insurance. An emergency fund will cover you if you can't work for a short time, but what happens if you're unable to work for an extended period? Social Security offers some coverage, but it's limited and the rules to qualify are quite strict. A private disability policy is worth looking into. It may seem expensive, but the right kind of insurance can help save you money. Consider a health savings account (HSA) While we're talking about health insurance, if you have a high-deductible health insurance policy, look into an HSA. Current minimum deductibles are $1,400 for self-only coverage, $2,800 for a family. With an HSA, you can make tax-deductible contributions up to an annual maximum. The limits for 2022 are $3,650 for a single person and $7,300 for a family. You can then use that money to pay for qualified medical expenses, tax-free at any time. Any money you don't use can be invested in the account and grow tax-deferred. You can withdraw funds for any reason penalty-free after age 65, but you'll pay ordinary income taxes on non-medical withdrawals, just like with an IRA. Which brings me to the next important point. Open a retirement account When it comes to your long-term financial stability, saving for retirement should be at the top of your list. Make it automatic. This is part of paying yourself first. As an independent contractor, you have a few choices for retirement accounts: Traditional IRA—Contributions may be tax-deductible and earnings grow tax-deferred. You can withdraw funds penalty-free after age 59½, but you'll pay ordinary income taxes on withdrawals. The current annual contribution limit is $6,000 ($7,000 if age 50 or older). Roth IRA—Consider a Roth if your income in 2022 is under $144,000 for single filers and $214,000 for married filing jointly. You don't get the upfront tax deduction, but earnings grow tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free after age 59½ if the Roth has been established for at least five years. That can make sense if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket come retirement than you are today. Contribution limits are the same as a traditional IRA. SEP IRA—A SEP is easy to set up and allows for higher annual contribution limits—up to 20% percent of your self-employment income or $61,000 in 2022, whichever is lower. Individual 401(k)—This involves a bit more set-up but has potentially higher contribution limits than a SEP and the option of making Roth contributions. SEP IRAs and 401(k)s are good options if you have employees. An advisor at your financial institution could help you explore what makes the most sense for your situation. You can also find information at irs.gov. At the very least, open an IRA and contribute the annual maximum. In your 30s, it's smart to aim to put 15%-20% of your annual salary toward retirement. That percentage goes up dramatically the longer you wait. Keep up on estimated taxes As an independent contractor, you're responsible for all self-employment taxes for Social Security and Medicare. The current self-employment tax rate is 15.3%. You pay this by filing quarterly estimated taxes. Fail to file and you'll pay a penalty. (Hint: Put the dates on your calendar!) To keep your tax bite lower, itemize your business expenses and keep good records. Be your own CFO You may now be your own boss but you also need to be your own CFO. That means carefully managing personal and business expenses both for the present and the long term. If you do that, you'll know you're on track for a financially secure future.

       "   'content': 'How do you come up with a down payment in today\\'s ultra-competitive housing market? Existing home prices have been growing steadily—surging nearly 20% in 2021 alone1—leaving the median home price above $400,000 around the end of last year.2 That\\'s nearly double what it was a decade ago. At the same time, the number of listings nationwide has been trending lower since at least 2016, according to data from Realtor.com. Throw in years of relatively slow wage growth, reports of crazy bidding wars and homes selling for way over asking, and now a potentially steep rise in mortgage rates as the Federal Reserve battles inflation, and it\\'s little wonder some would-be homeowners are sticking with their rentals. (That’s ok! Sometimes renting is the better option.) That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s impossible to make the leap, but even in this historically inhospitable market, many of the traditional financial rules of thumb for buying a home still apply—including those on pulling together a down payment. Here, we\\'ll review those guidelines and explore the tax and financial considerations behind some common ways of coming up with a down payment. What can you afford? Before you even worry about putting down any money, of course, you need to determine what you can afford. \"This doesn\\'t just mean figuring out what kind of monthly mortgage payment you can handle,\" says Chris Kawashima, CFP®, a senior research analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"Think about how homeownership affects your overall financial health—will it keep you from saving for retirement or paying for a kid\\'s education? Spending too much on a home can leave you feeling house rich and cash poor.\" Use Schwab Bank\\'s mortgage calculator to get a basic grasp on how much you’ll have to pay each month after accounting for your down payment. However, this isn’t likely to be the end of it. Keep in mind that you’ll also be signing up for years of maintenance. \"Don\\'t make the mistake of thinking that because your mortgage payment may end up lower than your rent, that buying a home is going to be cheaper,\" Chris says. \"There are additional costs like property taxes, home insurance, repairs and utility costs, landscaping, remodeling, etc. that will likely end up costing you more.\" Assuming your other goals are on track and you\\'re ready for the responsibility, here are two important financial metrics to understand: What\\'s your credit score? In general, you\\'ll need a credit score of at least 620 to secure a conventional mortgage, and higher scores can mean lower interest rates. If your score is lower than you\\'d like, take steps to improve it, such as paying bills on time and limiting how much debt you put on your credit cards. What’s your projected debt-to-income ratio? You can use the 28/36 rule to get started. The idea is that your total housing costs—including mortgage principal, interest, taxes, hazard insurance and potentially homeowner association payments—shouldn\\'t exceed 28% of your gross monthly income. All your debt combined shouldn’t exceed 36% of gross income. In both cases, the lower your debt-to-income ratio the better. Your down payment will obviously affect your debt-to-income ratio, as every dollar you can put toward the purchase of the home is one you won\\'t have to borrow. In general, the higher your down payment, the easier it will be to qualify for a mortgage loan and negotiate the lowest rate. Also, the more you agree to put down, the more competitive your offer may be, as financing can be a key consideration when sellers are reviewing multiple offers. That doesn’t mean you should stretch, though. Making your down payment Ideally, you want to aim for at least 20% down—which, if we use the median home price of more than $400,000, could mean $80,000. (And that doesn\\'t even include closing costs.) Otherwise, your lender will probably require that you carry private mortgage insurance (PMI). If that happens, you\\'ll have to pay monthly PMI premiums on top of your mortgage payments until your loan-to-value ratio—which compares the size of your mortgage to the value of your property—reaches 80%. While this may not be a dealbreaker, there are a few things to know. PMI protects the lender—not you—if you stop making payments on your loan. And it can be expensive (more than 1% of your loan balance per year, depending on how much you borrow and your credit score). Additionally, PMI can skew your debt-to-income ratio, potentially to the point where it affects your ability to qualify for a mortgage. One last thing: When you\\'re applying for a mortgage, you\\'ll need to show that you have enough assets to cover more than just your down payment. Your lender may also have a reserve requirement, meaning liquid assets you can use to make mortgage payments after you\\'ve put down your down payment. Usually, they want to see two months\\' worth of assets, but it can vary. So, after taking all that into account, what if you can\\'t do 20%? You can put down less If you can handle the extra cost of PMI, this can be an option. FHA loans, which are guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, allow first-time buyers to put down as little as 3.5%, with PMI. VA loans (available to active-duty members of the military, veterans, and some family members) are available for no down payments and no PMI. You can also put down less for conventional loans or carry a second mortgage (a \"piggyback\" loan). However, it\\'s crucial to understand that putting down less means you’re going to have a lot more debt and larger monthly payments. One potential upside is that if you put down, say, 15%, and the value of your home rises swiftly, your loan-to-value ratio could hit 80% quickly. If your mortgage servicer allows, you could get another home appraisal to remove PMI. However, before scheduling an appraisal, you should contact your servicer to see if this is an option, as there may be a two-year minimum requirement for keeping PMI on the loan. Assistance is available First-time buyers may also have access to a variety of federal, state, and local programs offering grants or special no- or low-interest loans to cover the cost of a down payment. This can help lower your loan-to-value ratio, as you won’t have to borrow as much, and if your monthly payments are within the 28%/36% debt-to-income guardrails mentioned above, this can be a decent option. Just make sure dodging a down payment doesn\\'t tempt you into getting more house than you need. Also be aware that some assistance programs require that you repay what you receive, or even live in the house for a certain period. Coming up with the cash Saving and investing If you\\'ve been planning for this and are ready with 20%, well done! As long as your debt-to-income ratio looks good and your finances are in order, go forth and conquer. If you\\'re still a couple years out and concerned about the way prices and interest rates are moving, resist the temptation to take more risks with your investments. Money that you\\'ll need soon or can\\'t afford to lose shouldn\\'t be in the stock market—it\\'s better to invest it in relatively stable assets, such as money market funds, certificates of deposit (CDs), or Treasury bills. Delaying your purchase may be a better approach than chasing risky returns. Family loans or gifts Many first-time buyers get a little help from their families. The benefits of gifts are undeniable: You can hit your down payment target easier, and immediately lower your loan-to-value ratio. Family members who give you money can also take advantage of the annual gift tax exclusion of $16,000 per person ($32,000 for married couples). Of course, gifts can be larger than that amount, but anything over the limit will count against their lifetime estate/gift tax exemption amount of $12.06 million per individual, or $24.12 million per couple, in 2022. (If they\\'ve already hit their limit, the gift could be taxable.) Loans are more complicated. Even though this is an intra-family affair, the IRS requires certain formalities such as a signed written agreement, a fixed repayment schedule, and a minimum interest rate, otherwise they will assume the loan was a gift. You might consider having an attorney draw up the paperwork. And to avoid future family fights, it’s essential that everyone is clear about their intentions regarding the repayment. Your lender may also require a written agreement, and will take the repayment terms into account when deciding whether you qualify for the mortgage, as a loan will impact your debt-to-income ratio. Family members may also have to document the source of any gift or loan to verify it is from their savings, and not a separate loan they took out to help you. \"Don\\'t forget: If you\\'re borrowing for your down payment and a mortgage, you\\'ll end repaying two loans,\" Chris says. \"Borrowing a down payment could also get in the way of saving for your other goals. And, if you ever get into financial trouble and you need to do a short sale or face foreclosure, the bank will get its money before your family does, which can strain your relationship.\" Cashing out stock awards A grant of company stock or stock options can also be a source of cash for a down payment. However, the tax rules for such grants can be complicated. It would be a shame to sell off a lump of stock to make your down payment, only to be hit by a huge tax bill when you file your return for the year. Employers are required to withhold only a minimum amount for taxes. If you are planning to sell appreciated stock, talk with a tax advisor about setting aside enough additional cash to cover the eventual bill. Also be aware that if your stock options or restricted stock aren\\'t fully vested, they\\'re not going to help you put together a down payment or qualify for a loan. \"Underwriters are going to look at assets that are liquid or can be readily liquidated: What stock is available to sell now?\" Chris says. \"If it\\'s all \\'promise\\' in the form of options or restricted stock that vest in the future, they will not be considered eligible assets, including for any reserve requirements.\" Borrowing from your retirement savings Many 401(k) plans allow you to take out loans against your savings, but this should really be your last resort. Loans from a 401(k) are limited to one-half the vested value of your account or a maximum of $50,000—whichever is less. However, even though you\\'re borrowing from yourself, it\\'s still a loan you\\'ll need to repay with interest (generally one or two percentage points above banks\\' prime rate). And when you pay yourself back, it\\'ll be with after-tax dollars that will be taxed again when you eventually start drawing from the account in retirement. If you don\\'t pay yourself back, it\\'ll be considered a withdrawal subject to income taxes and a 10% penalty. Another issue is that if you take a loan against your 401(k), your plan administrator may not allow you to make any additional contributions until you’ve repaid what you borrowed. That could set your retirement plans back. What about IRAs? First-time homebuyers can withdraw up to $10,000 from an IRA without incurring the 10% early-withdrawal penalty, but ordinary income taxes apply if it is from a tax-deferred traditional IRA. For Roth IRAs, you can withdraw your contributions (i.e., the principal) at any time without tax consequences. However, complications arise if you want to tap the account\\'s earnings or if the Roth assets are from a conversion. We recommend consulting with a tax professional before withdrawing those types of assets. 1Source: S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index. 2Source: U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Median Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States, retrieved the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, If nothing else, the last few years have demonstrated just how unpredictable life can get. So, when it comes to planning for retirement—which might be years or even decades in the future—the risks and uncertainties can feel overwhelming. Interestingly, even though everyone’s situation is unique, most of us share the same four concerns: What if the stock market crashes? What if I outlive my money? What if inflation eats up my resources? What if I have huge medical or long-term care expenses? These are tough questions for sure, but the good news is that once we ask them, we can take positive steps to prepare. Protect yourself from stock market declines If you\\'re a regular Ask Carrie reader, you know I\\'m a firm believer in the power of the stock market to build long-term wealth. But along the way, we should also expect and plan for inevitable downturns. When these dips occur close to or in retirement, they can be especially painful, not only because we likely have more money at stake than we had when we were younger, but also because we have less time to make back what we lose in a downturn. The best defense? Make sure your portfolio\\'s asset allocation matches your willingness and ability to take on market risk. If you do this at the outset, that\\'s great—but then be sure to adjust your risk exposure by rebalancing your portfolio on a regular basis. You should also consider doing so when either market conditions or your personal circumstances change. To be clear, this does not mean chasing returns or attempting to time the market. As a general guideline, it can be wise to gradually decrease your allocation to equities while you increase your holdings of fixed income as you age. Money you will need in the next two to three years shouldn\\'t be invested in stocks. Keep it in a safe, liquid checking or savings account or otherwise invested in safe assets that can be easily converted into cash. That way, if the market tanks, you won\\'t be forced to sell and seal your loss. That said, keeping at least some stocks in your portfolio, even in late retirement, can help extend the life of your savings by delivering opportunities for growth and higher returns over time. Plan for a long life The good news is that with life expectancies increasing, your retirement might last for 30 or even 40 years. Of course, to make the most of those years, you’ll have to have that much larger of a nest egg. You can start to plan for what financial planners call \"longevity risk\"—that is, the risk that comes from living an unexpectedly long life—not only by holding onto some equities and saving more, but also by delaying filing for Social Security until you qualify for your maximum benefit (age 70 for wage earners, or “full retirement age” for spousal benefits). Other strategies can include buying an annuity to guarantee income for life, being prudent with your retirement budget, downsizing to a less expensive home, and perhaps even taking out a reverse mortgage to tap into your home’s equity. As an investor, it\\'s also essential to minimize fees, which can easily erode your portfolio. Don\\'t become a victim of inflation Easily overlooked but potentially devastating in its impact, inflation is often referred to as the silent killer. To illustrate, just a 3% rate of inflation will cut your purchasing power by 26% after 10 years and 45% after 20 years. Put another way, with 3% annual inflation, $1 million will have the purchasing power of about $560,000 in 20 years—or less if inflation is higher. Clearly this is serious for a retiree, or for anyone living on a fixed income—so it\\'s essential that we all build inflation into our financial plans. You can think of it as a balancing act: Yes, we need to protect ourselves against market risk by keeping our shorter-term money liquid and safe, but we also need enough stock market exposure to combat inflation in retirement. In addition, fixed income funds can reinvest in securities offering higher yields as interest rates rise to counter inflation. Investors can also look to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), or Series I Savings Bonds, as well as real estate and commodities. In terms of everyday money management, it’s generally smart to pay off credit card debt as well as other types of variable rate debt that can become more expensive with time. During periods of high inflation, it\\'s even more important to become a vigilant comparison shopper, seeking out less expensive alternatives for goods and services, taking advantage of sales and discounts, and perhaps even paying in cash for high-ticket items such as an appliance or car instead of financing. Prepare for increasing medical and long-term care expenses It\\'s an unfortunate fact of life that our medical needs tend to increase as we age. Compounding this, the cost of medical and long-term care has increased even more than the general rate of inflation. According to a 2020 estimate from EBRI, the average married couple aged 65 would need approximately $168,000-$325,000 to cover medical expenses in retirement—not including long term care expenses. According to Genworth, the average cost of a nursing home private room in 2020 was almost $106,000, with home care averaging almost $55,000 per year. Many medical conditions are unavoidable, and I would be remiss if I didn\\'t mention the importance of maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle. But issues still arise for all of us, so make sure you have good health insurance and never scrimp on routine or immediate care. It\\'s also essential to have a plan for long-term care whether or not that includes long-term care insurance. You can also give yourself a head start by contributing the maximum every year to a health savings account (HSA) if you are eligible. These accounts allow you to save and invest tax-free for future health costs. And before you reach 65, take your time to evaluate the best Medicare options. Retire on your terms After decades of hard work, retirement can be a fulfilling new chapter in your life – but it requires sound preparation. A financial planner can be a great partner as you explore different strategies. By taking the time to address the risks now, you’ll be in the best position to eventually enjoy the rewards of a well-planned retirement. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': 'Many retirees risk outliving their retirement savings. The reason? Either failure to save enough—or to plan ahead. While many of us understand the need to set aside a portion of our income on a regular basis for our golden years, far fewer have a plan for determining if they\\'ve saved enough to retire and a strategy to convert those savings into a lasting income. In fact, only 54% of planners and 18% of non-planners are confident that they\\'ll achieve their financial goals.1 Creating income during retirement may sound daunting, but it doesn\\'t have to be. We recommend doing so in four simple steps: plan, invest, distribute, and monitor. In this article, we\\'ll take you through the first, and arguably most important, one: planning—including how much you\\'ll need during retirement and assessing whether you\\'ve saved enough when the time comes. Your life, your plan First, start with a vision—and projection—of your retirement finances. No two retirements are the same. Your plan should encompass your vision: What are your goals, and what resources will you need to meet them? Here are three basic questions you should ask as you begin the planning process: How much will you need to spend to achieve your goals? How much do you expect to earn from your savings, Social Security, and other potential sources of income? What will you do if your savings fall short? 1. How much will you need to spend? One school of thought says you\\'ll need 75% to 80% of your current income to maintain your present standard of living. That\\'s because some costs—such as mortgage payments or work-related expenses like clothing and commuting—are expected to decrease or go away altogether. However, while some costs may be reduced, others—such as travel, entertainment, and health care—may increase. Therefore, it might be safer to assume you\\'ll need roughly the same level of annual income that you earn now minus other potential sources of income, such as savings and Social Security. As an example, let\\'s say you earn $100,000 a year before taxes and are saving $10,000 a year toward retirement. Based on the 75% to 80% rule, you\\'d need between $75,000 and $80,000 a year in retirement. But it\\'s safer to assume that you\\'ll need $90,000 annually—that is, $100,000 minus the $10,000 you are currently allocating to retirement savings—all things being equal. How much of your current income will you need? Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research Another approach is to create a detailed budget by breaking down anticipated expenses into two groups: Essential expenses, or those you can\\'t live without, such as food, health care, and housing. Discretionary expenses, or those that are nice to have (not need to have), like entertainment, restaurants, and travel. If you own your home, you should also budget for expenses like major appliance replacements and other improvements and repairs that may be required during your retirement. You might also include possible one-time expenses, such as moving or taking that dream trip you\\'ve been putting off. A detailed budget can be more meaningful, and helpful, near retirement. 2. How much retirement income can you expect? Once you have an idea of how much you\\'ll need to spend, you can begin to calculate whether you\\'ll have enough resources. First, tally up any earnings you expect to receive from pensions, Social Security, and any other sources of income—separate from your savings. Then, subtract that amount from your estimated expenses to determine how much income will need to come from your portfolio.

Learn more about planning for nonportfolio income, including Social Security and other retirement income. Social Security and other retirement income.\" id=\"body_disclosure--media_disclosure--53521\" > Learn more about planning for nonportfolio income, including Social Security and other retirement income. For example, let\\'s say you\\'re shooting for $90,000 in annual spending. Assuming your nonportfolio income amounts to $30,000 a year, you\\'ll need $60,000 a year from your portfolio. Gauging your annual retirement portfolio income Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research According to our research, a portfolio that\\'s roughly 25 times as large as the amount needed for your first year of retirement has a very high likelihood—if invested appropriately—of lasting 30 years or more under most market scenarios, even with increasing your withdrawals each year to give you a pay raise and keep up with inflation.2 With that 25x target in mind and an annual portfolio withdrawal of $60,000, a portfolio value of $1.5 million—supplemented by non-portfolio income—would support your retirement spending. Calculating your retirement savings goal Although the so-called \"25x rule\" is a target, if you\\'re nearing retirement and haven\\'t saved this much, don\\'t panic. We see the guideline as a conservative rule to provide high level of confidence that savings will last. It\\'s always a good idea to consult a financial planner to create your own personalized financial calculations and plan—particularly as you approach retirement. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research Although the so-called \"25x rule\" is a target, if you\\'re nearing retirement and haven\\'t quite reached your savings goal, don\\'t panic. This guideline is a conservative rule to provide a rough sense of whether your savings will last the average 30-year retirement. It\\'s always a good idea to work with a professional who will take your current situation into account to create a personalized, more nuanced retirement transition and income plan—especially as you near retirement. 3. What if your savings fall short? While some investors will find themselves on target, others will discover that they may not have saved as much as they would have liked. If you experience the latter, here are several ways to adjust: Step up your saving Contribute the maximum to your 401(k). Contribute to an individual retirement account (IRA). Contribute to a SEP-IRA if you\\'re self-employed. Make additional catch-up contributions if you\\'re over 50. Earmark bonuses, raises, and tax refunds for retirement. Consider waiting Work longer to help preserve your savings. Work until you\\'re eligible for Medicare to avoid the expense of private coverage. Wait to collect Social Security. You can begin collecting benefits as early as age 62, though it will be reduced by 25%–30% compared with your full retirement age (between 66 and 67). Once you attain full retirement age, every year you wait up to age 70 increases your benefit by 8%. Consider a phased retirement that includes part-time work to help reduce the need to file for Social Security payments before full retirement age and to reduce withdrawals from your portfolio. Prioritize Reduce discretionary spending by separating \"nice to haves\" from \"need to haves.\" Cover \"need to haves\" with proceeds from pensions, Social Security, and other relatively reliable sources of income whenever possible. During retirement, prioritizing spending is helpful too. In a down market, you can reduce discretionary spending to help savings last. Periodic check-ins It\\'s important to remember that retirement-income planning isn\\'t a \"set it and forget it\" exercise, especially in the years just prior to retirement and after retirement begins. Rather, a retirement plan that goes beyond the general guidelines suggested here should be a working document that is reevaluated at least annually to account for any changes to inflation, investment returns, life expectancy, spending, and taxes. This may sound like a lot of work, but by planning today, you can confidently count on going the distance tomorrow. Following a plan, but remaining flexible, can help make your savings last so that you can enjoy your retirement. 1Charles Schwab, Charles Schwab Modern Wealth Survey 2021 (Logica Research, 2021), https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schwab_modern_wealth_survey_2021_findings.pdf. 2This is a general estimate only.

       "   'abstract': 'The pros and cons of different methods for leaving a home to your heirs.',\n",
       "   'content': 'When it comes to estate planning, a family home can be among the most valuable—and complicated—assets to pass down. \"It\\'s perfectly natural to want to see a cherished home stay within the family,\" says George Pennock, director of trust services consulting at Charles Schwab Trust Company. \"But you need to think about not only your own needs and wishes but also those of your heirs.\" For example, your child may love the family home and all the memories that go with it, but does he or she actually want to live there? If you have multiple heirs, is it realistic for them to co-own the property, or will such an arrangement create conflict? You also need to consider the role the house will play in your later years. \"Do you plan to stay in the home, or is it possible you may need or want to move at some point?\" George asks. \"All of this factors into how—and whether—you transfer the property to your kids.\" With that in mind, here are three ways to pass along a home to your heirs—both during and after your lifetime. 1. Sell it If you\\'re looking to move or put your home\\'s equity to use elsewhere, selling the home to a child or other heir could be a good option. Doing so removes the property from your taxable estate and establishes a new cost basis—meaning the capital gains on any future sale will be calculated using the value of the home on the date of the transfer rather than your original purchase price. Although you might be tempted to sell the home at a low price, be careful not to go below its fair market value. Otherwise, the difference between the sale price and the market value could be subject to gift taxes. 2. Gift it As generous as it is to gift a home to an heir during your lifetime, it could have negative tax repercussions. That\\'s because such a gift counts toward your lifetime gift tax exemption. That might not seem like an issue now that the combined gift and estate tax exemption is $12.06 million for individuals ($24.12 million for married couples) in 2022, but that number is set to come down by half starting in 2026, if not sooner. If that happens, such a gift could result in a federal estate tax of up to 40%, depending on the size of your estate. State-level gift, estate, and inheritance taxes could also be a factor, depending on where you live. The tax consequences could be even more severe for your heirs, especially if you give your home to your child during your lifetime—such as through a deed transfer. If your child decides to sell the home, the cost basis will be calculated using your original purchase price, potentially increasing the capital gains. 3. Pass it down Generally speaking, there are three methods for leaving a home to your heirs: Last will and testament: You can use your will to designate to whom the home should go and in what proportions. That said, wills are required to go through probate—the sometimes lengthy and often costly legal process of validating your will—which can slow down the transfer of ownership to your heirs. Transfer-on-death deed: If probate is a concern, you may be able to sign a transfer-on-death deed—available in 29 states and the District of Columbia—which allows you to pass the property to your heirs outside probate upon your death. Trust: Another way to avoid probate is to transfer the property into a living trust, which has the benefit of allowing you greater control over how the property is managed and under what conditions it can be sold. The home would remain part of your estate until your death, at which time it would pass to your heirs outside probate. However generous your intent, George warns that the bequest of a home can be an albatross if not accompanied by additional funds to help cover improvements, insurance, maintenance, and taxes—particularly if you plan to leave it to multiple heirs. \"You don\\'t want to make your kids house rich and cash poor,\" George says. \"Nor do you want them fighting about the costs of ongoing maintenance and upkeep.\" In such cases, setting aside funds in a trust dedicated for this purpose can help ensure the home is well maintained for years to come. Regardless of the method you use to pass down the home, it will receive a new cost basis upon your death, meaning any capital gains taxes resulting from a future sale would be calculated using the fair market value at the time of the transfer. Talk it out Whether you sell, gift, or pass down your property, the transfer could trigger a reassessment of the home\\'s property taxes, so be sure to factor that into your plan—ideally with the help of an attorney or a tax advisor. In addition to consulting financial professionals who can help you put your plan in place, you\\'ll want input from anyone affected by your decision. \"The most important thing you can do is to make sure all family members are part of the conversation,\" George says. \"That way, everyone has the chance to see their needs and wishes reflected in the plan for your home, which can avoid unnecessary conflict down the road.\"'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My wife started a business 10 years ago and contributed to a regular IRA in the beginning. Three years ago, she incorporated the company and they don't have a 401(k) yet. What's her best option for retirement savings right now? —A Reader Dear Reader, This is an excellent question for every small business owner—whether firmly established or just starting out. That's because, although contributing to an IRA is definitely a good idea, small business owners have several other options that can significantly increase the amount they can save in a tax-effective way. Here are some small business retirement plans for your wife to explore. Incorporation isn't the key factor here, but rather whether your wife has employees and, if so, how many. All provide tax advantages without the paperwork, cost, and administration required by a 401(k), but do have different characteristics that might make one plan better than another for her needs. SEP-IRA: The easiest to set up and maintain, particularly suited to sole proprietors A SEP-IRA (or a Simplified Employee Pension) can be a great choice for saving a lot and keeping paperwork to a minimum whether or not you have employees. It's easy to open and lets you make fairly high annual contributions. It also gives you the flexibility to vary contributions—or skip them entirely—according to your yearly business needs. A SEP-IRA can be ideal for a sole proprietor. Annual contributions can be as high as 20% of net self-employment income for an owner, up to 61,000 in 2022. However, there are a few caveats if you have employees. First, all contributions are made by the employer, not the employee. And, as an employer, you're required to contribute the same percentage of an employee's compensation as you contribute for yourself. That could end up being a hefty sum if you have more than a few employees. Individual 401(k): Offers higher contribution limits if you have no employees except your spouse An Individual 401(k) or an Individual Roth 401(k) can be a great choice for contributing a lot, but it's only available if you work for yourself and your only employee is your spouse. It requires a little more paperwork than a SEP, but allows even higher contributions—20% of net self employment income for the business owner, plus an additional $20,500 in salary deferrals for 2022, with a maximum of $61,000 for this year. If you're 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $6,500, bringing the maximum to $67,500. If your spouse is also an employee, he or she can also contribute up to $20,500 in salary deferrals (plus a catch-up contribution of $6,500 if age 50-plus). And you, as the employer, can match that contribution up to 20% of salary subject to the same maximums. That all adds up to quite a significant sum! SIMPLE-IRA: Good if you have up to 100 employees and want them to contribute to their own retirement A SIMPLE-IRA (or Savings Incentive Match for Employees) is available to companies with 100 or fewer employees. With this plan, employees make their own retirement contributions—up to $14,000 for 2022, with a catch-up contribution of $3,000 for those age 50-plus. As the employer, you’re required to make a small matching contribution (up to 3% of employee compensation) or contribute a flat 2% of compensation. While your obligation as an employer is less, the contributions you can make for yourself are also significantly lower than for a SEP-IRA or Individual 401(k). That's because the business owner is subject to the same contribution limits as employees. A regular IRA: Still a smart personal choice The good news is that you can contribute to both a small business retirement plan and a traditional or Roth IRA. You may still be eligible for a tax deduction with traditional contributions, depending on your income. So I encourage your wife—and you, too—to contribute the maximum to an IRA each year. For 2022, that's $6,000 with a $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older. The bottom line: Talk to your tax advisor As you can see, there are a number of options for small businesses, depending on how many employees there are and the type of opportunity a business owner wants to provide for employees. The next thing for your wife to do is to talk to her tax advisor—and also any business partners—to determine which plan offers the best combination of savings opportunities and tax advantages for her specific business. While all of these plans require minimal set-up and administration, the details vary. It's best to get all the facts, and then weigh them in light of current business plans and future goals.

       "   'content': 'There is no shortage of headwinds facing both the market and the economy: the tragic Russian invasion of Ukraine and attendant commodity/energy crisis; the Federal Reserve\\'s transition from accommodative to tighter monetary policy; increased chatter of a recession on the horizon; among others. Yet, over the past month, stocks have rallied sharply, coming close to erasing their year-to-date losses. Whether this proves to be a rally in the midst of a bear market, or the end of a corrective phase and start of a leg higher, remains to be seen. Regardless, attempting to guess the short-term moves of the market is always treacherous; so, let\\'s stick with what we know and assess the health of the rally. Taking stock From their own respective troughs, the major indexes have experienced sharp gains: S&P 500 (since its trough on March 8th) has gained 9% NASDAQ (since its trough on March 14th) has gained 13% Russell 2000 (since its trough on January 27th) has gained 8%. Those moves are impressive when considering—on a year-to-date basis—all three indexes have undergone a traditional correction (a decline of at least 10%), and the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 did experience traditional bear markets (a decline of at least 20% from a high), as shown in the table below. Individual member performance within those benchmarks has been worse, with the average member\\'s maximum drawdown from year-to-date highs ranging from -19% to -29%, and from 52-week highs ranging from -25% to -46%. Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 4/1/2022. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Some members excluded from year-to-date return columns given additions to indices were after January 2022. As we often highlight, investor sentiment—a contrarian indicator at extremes—can help establish both short-term troughs and peaks for the stock market. Shown below is the percentage of bearish respondents to the weekly American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) survey of its members. Bearishness hit a relative low of less than 25% last November and had only lifted to 30% as 2022 began. That may have served as a contrarian indicator for stocks, which began to fall under the weight of monetary policy and geopolitical uncertainty. By the time Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24th, bearishness had surged to nearly 55%, perhaps serving as a contrarian indicator for stocks in the other direction. The move back down to 27% suggests most of the recent pessimism has retreated and could be a setup for more weakness. Low bearishness again Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 3/31/2022. At the surface level, participation during the latest rally has been fairly strong. As shown in the chart below, the percentage of index members trading above their 50-day moving averages has climbed sharply, relative to much more anemic percentages at the beginning of March.

There has, so far, been less of an improvement, with the S&P 500 having led the way while the other two indexes have yet to match its strength. Long-term breadth improving Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 4/1/2022. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Another hint of weakness shows up in the sector breakdown for the S&P 500. As shown in the next chart, traditionally defensive areas such as Utilities, REITs, and Consumer Staples experienced strong participation among their members, which is at odds with the strength (or lack thereof) in the traditionally cyclical areas like Financials, Industrials, and Materials. The Energy sector is indeed a cyclical sector but remains an outlier given it has, unsurprisingly, benefited from the surge in oil prices this year.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. In search of quality and quantity Similar to what we saw after the pandemic trough on March 23rd, 2020, some of the largest tech- and tech-related members in the S&P 500 by market cap—dubbed the \"super 7\" and shown in the chart below—have helped propel the index’s rebound. It remains debatable whether their current outsized contributions are healthy. There was a stronger justification in March 2020, given the economy was shut down and we were living almost solely in the spheres represented by these companies. The differences today are stark, though, given a broader reopening has been underway for the better part of a year and the worst of the pandemic is hopefully behind us. Supersized rebound Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 4/1/2022. Individual stocks are shown for illustration purposes only. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Moving to the not-as-good news, let\\'s dissect some of the best performers within the indexes. Shown in the pair of charts below is the performance for several benchmarks before and after the S&P 500\\'s trough on March 8th. All three major indexes are up by at least 5% from the trough (nearly 12% for the NASDAQ). All aboard the rebound Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 4/1/2022. Data indexed to 100 (base value = 3/8/2022). An index number is a figure reflecting price or quantity compared with a base value. The base value always has an index number of 100. The index number is then expressed as 100 times the ratio to the base value. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The rub is that some of the most speculative and arguably low-quality segments of the market have outperformed the major indexes markedly over the same timeframe. As shown below, non-profitable tech stocks, meme stocks, SPACs, and heavily shorted stocks have had much stronger gains—some well into double-digit percentage territory, with the memes leading the way.

Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The outperformance in those areas may make it seem that the low-quality rally is concentrated in more arcane pockets, but if we zoom out to look at the market in its entirety—proxied by the Russell 3000—the thesis still holds. The chart below shows performance for two periods: the peak on January 3rd this year to the trough on March 8th (yellow bars) and the rally since the trough (blue bars). Performance is broken up by earnings per share (EPS) growth decile, with decile 1 representing no or negative EPS and 10 representing the highest EPS. As shown, the members on the weaker end of the EPS spectrum were hit the hardest from peak to trough, but have led the subsequent bounce higher. In other words, this is looking more like a mean reversion trade than the start of a new era of lower-quality leadership. No EPS? No problem (for now) Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 4/1/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Historically, lower-quality segments of the stock market—including non-profitable companies—have launched into leadership positions when there is an expectation of accelerating economic growth. That is not a safe bet in the current environment. At the industry level, shown below, economically sensitive areas have not held up as well as the broader S&P 500 index. Given the brutal start for the bond market this year, selling there has been a key source of buying pressure for equities.

The uniquely tricky phase the markets are in contributed to our recent decision to temporarily \"neutralize\" our tactical asset and sector allocation recommendations. Instead, we are suggesting investors utilize the diversification associated with their strategic allocations—and the periodic rebalancing needed to keep those in line with targets—to navigate the current environment. To view the benefits of diversification (across and within asset classes) with a shorter-term lens, we took liberties with regard to our traditional \"asset class quilt.\" The first quilt below is a version of our standard quilt, but instead of the broad asset classes ranked for performance by year, we ranked them by month over the past year. As shown, Commodities have been a stellar performer over the past year; but they also spent two months at the bottom of the performance rankings. Conversely, Emerging Markets was the worst-performer over the past year, but it ranked last only once (relative to Commodities\\' two times). Trying to time those shorter-term moves is extremely difficult. Asset classes ranked by month Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Morningstar, Inc., as of 3/31/2022. Asset class performance represented by annual total returns for the following indexes: S&P 500® Index (US Lg Cap), Russell 2000® Index (US Sm Cap), MSCI EAFE® Net of Taxes (Int’l Dev), MSCI Emerging Markets IndexSM (EM), MSCI US REIT Index (REITs), S&P GSCI® (Comm.), Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury Inflation-Linked Bond Index (TIPS), Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (Core US Bonds), Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield Bond Index (High Yield Bonds), Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Ex-USD TR Index (Int’l Dev Bonds), Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets USD Bond TR Index (EM Bonds), FTSE U.S. 3-Month T-Bill Index (T-Bills). Past results are not an indication or guarantee of future performance. Returns assume reinvestment of dividends, interest, and capital gains. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. The second quilt below ranks the 11 S&P 500 sectors, also by monthly performance. Like Commodities (which of course have energy components), Energy has been the best-performing sector over the past year. However, it was actually the worst-performing sector in more months (four) than it was the best-performing sector (three). Conversely, Communication Services has been the worst performer over the past year, but it ranked last only twice (relative to Energy\\'s four times). Like with broader asset classes, trying to time those shorter-term moves is extremely difficult in this environment. Sectors ranked by month Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 3/31/2022. Sector performance is represented by price returns of the following 11 GICS sector indices: Consumer Discretionary Sector, Consumer Staples Sector, Energy Sector, Financials Sector, Health Care Sector, Industrials Sector, Information Technology Sector, Materials Sector, Real Estate Sector, Communication Services Sector, and Utilities Sector. Returns of the broad market are represented by the S&P 500. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For what it\\'s worth, both Energy as a sector, and Commodities as an asset class run the risk associated with being technically \"over-bought.\" In the event there is some sort of end to the war in Ukraine, both could come under significant pressure; but, of course, a further escalation could work in the opposite direction. Over-bought conditions may be in place; however, that\\'s in stark contrast with the fact that they both remain \"under-owned\" in portfolios (in general). In sum Stocks have had two back-to-back downturns this year, followed by a relief rally. Leadership has flip-flopped, as has investor sentiment. Fed tightening and the war in Ukraine have been the dominant macro forces. The correction earlier this year was largely about higher inflation and rate hikes. More recently, the inversion in the yield spread between 10-year and 2-year Treasuries has heightened recession risk. However, it doesn\\'t appear as if the stock market has appropriately priced in likely weaker economic growth to come—or the likely weaker accompanying earnings growth. Trying to trade around these short-term swings has been difficult, and we recommend a relatively neutral stance—while using the diversification associated with strategic allocations, and periodic rebalancing to navigate the volatility. For stock pickers, we continue to recommend a factor-based approach vs. either a sector-based or style index-based approach. We believe factors such as strong free cash flow, low volatility, and rising earnings revisions will ultimately lead throughout this period of likely heightened volatility.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, 2022 is off to a rough start for investors. Already reeling from the prospect of higher interest rates, ongoing supply chain issues from the pandemic, inflation, and increased geopolitical uncertainty, our emotions are running hot, and our sense of security has been rattled—not to mention the fact that financial markets have been volatile. It\\'s understandable for investors to panic when markets suffer a sharp decline. After all, that\\'s our hard-earned savings and investments we see disappearing. It\\'s the financial security we\\'re counting on to make important purchases, live our lives comfortably and care for our loved ones. Unfortunately, though, that sense of panic that comes so naturally is not our friend. In fact, it can cause us to behave in a way that is in direct conflict with our best interests. You know the old saying \"buy low, sell high.\" Well, panic can easily make us do just the opposite. So, what\\'s an investor to do instead? As someone who has benefited greatly from the practice of daily meditation, I\\'d like to share a simple but effective four-step technique that can translate to the world of investing. Known by the acronym S.T.O.P., it can help us remain clear-headed and focused in the face of challenges, whether those challenges are personal, professional, or yes—even financial. Stop: This first step probably sounds easy, but it may be the hardest. Give yourself a moment not just to slow down, but to come to a full stop. No cable news, no social media, no checking your portfolio. Studies have shown that investors who constantly tinker with their portfolios do more harm than good. So, instead of logging onto your accounts, take a walk, sit quietly, listen to music, or practice meditation—anything that will give you a break. Take a deep breath: Once you\\'ve come to a stop, help your body relax further by breathing deeply. Literally. Breathe in, breath out. It\\'s a lot like the \\'tactical breathing\\' that Navy SEALS are trained to use. When you\\'re stressed, you\\'re more likely to say or do something you\\'ll later regret (we’ve all been there). So do your portfolio a favor by relaxing and clearing your mind before you make a rash decision. Observe (but don\\'t act): Once you\\'re relaxed, you\\'re in a great place to open up your mind and gain perspective. First, remind yourself of some basic facts. As uncomfortable as they may be, market declines are inevitable. But the pain is temporary and markets tend to reward investors who can tolerate this temporary discomfort. With this perspective, take a few minutes to reflect on your goals and time horizon as well as your willingness to take on risk. What are you saving for? If its retirement that’s decades away, remind yourself that you have many years to ride out the current downturn. But if you\\'re saving for something in the next few years, perhaps you\\'ve taken on too much risk and you should consider rebalancing. There are no universally right or wrong answers. The important point is to take the time you need to calmly evaluate your situation. Proceed: Once you\\'ve gained a deeper understanding of current conditions and have reasonable projections for the future, you can consider making a change—or not. When markets are in decline, often the hardest—but smartest—approach is to do nothing. But once you’ve taken the time to S.T.O.P., you\\'re in a much better position to act with clarity and purpose. With this knowledge front and center, accept that you can\\'t succeed by trying to time the markets. Instead, use your energy to focus on the things you can control: your asset allocation, diversification, and savings rate. Once you have a well-constructed financial plan with a balanced portfolio in place, investing is less an epic battle between you and the markets, and more a tug-of-war between your emotions and your actions. Warren Buffet puts it this way: \"All that\\'s required is the passage of time, an inner calm, ample diversification, patience, and a minimization of transactions and fees.\" Yes, that\\'s a tall order. But whether it\\'s S.T.O.P. or another technique that works better for you, when the markets decline, do your best to focus on your goals and stay the course. Try to view periodic losses and uncertainty as nothing more than distractions. Investing rewards those who have a disciplined process and requires patience during times of volatility and uncertainty.

       "   'content': \"For the past month, investors have been focused on the war on Ukraine and the economic impact of sanctions. As the first quarter wraps up this week, we get to review the impact current developments around the world have had on the most important driver of stock prices over the long-term: earnings. The corporate earnings outlook has been relatively stable despite the backdrop of war in Ukraine. Although the unofficial start of the earnings reporting season is still a couple of weeks away, there is the potential for market moving news ahead of these announcements. The weeks around the end of the quarter often see companies who expect to fall short of their earnings targets downwardly revise their guidance. So far, the changes in first quarters' earnings estimates have been modest. Earnings per share growth in 2022 for companies around the world (as measured by the MSCI All Country World Index) is now expected by FactSet analysts' consensus to be up 6%. Prior to the invasion, the consensus was at 7%, a difference of only 1%. Higher post-invasion forecasts in the energy, materials and industrials sectors partially offset modest declines across other sectors. Pre- and post-invasion 2022 EPS estimates Source: Charles Schwab, FactSet data as of 3/25/2022. Forecasts contained herein are for illustrative purposes only, may be based upon proprietary research and are developed through analysis of historical public data. Geographically, earnings per share estimates for 2022 show that the rising trends in the U.S., U.K., and Japan have not changed much this year. Despite Europe's proximity to the conflict and dependence upon Russian energy supplies, earnings growth is still expected to be higher than it was at the start of the year, though lower by about 1.5% from pre-invasion levels. Percent change in 2022 EPS forecasts since start of year Source: Charles Schwab, FactSet data as of 3/25/2022. There are a couple notable pre- and post-invasion differences: Canada, a major commodity producer, has jumped higher since the start of the conflict, bolstered by higher prices. Emerging markets (EM), when measured in U.S. dollars, have dropped—tied to the earnings of Russian oil companies dropping out of the index and weakness due to EM currencies falling versus the U.S. dollar. Notably, China and other major emerging market earnings outlooks haven’t changed much. Reflecting the changes in estimates since the start of the year, analysts' forecasts for earnings growth in 2022 are still positive across countries and regions heading into the first quarter earnings reporting season, as you can see in the chart below. 2022 earnings growth still seen positive across countries and regions Source: Charles Schwab, FactSet data as of 3/25/2022. Forecasts contained herein are for illustrative purposes only, may be based upon proprietary research and are developed through analysis of historical public data. Although forecasts for the year are usually raised during the earnings season as companies typically exceed quarterly estimates, there is greater uncertainty this season given the Ukraine conflict, inflation, and lingering COVID-19 waves. One of the best leading indicators of the trend in earnings expectations is the global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI). This survey of business leaders from companies around the world is typically about three months ahead of analysts' forecasts for earnings over the coming 12 months, as you can see in the chart below of the past 20 years. PMI leads earning trends Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg (PMI) and Factset (MSCI) data as of 3/25/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The level of 50 on the PMI is the threshold between expansion and contraction in manufacturing and tends to align with the division in the outlook between growth and decline in earnings for all companies over the coming year. We will get March's reading of the global manufacturing PMI on April 1. This month's preliminary PMI readings for major countries like the U.S., Germany, France, and Japan were resilient despite the war, reflecting only a small dip. If this trend is confirmed with the final global PMI reading on April Fools' Day, it suggests the outlook for earnings growth is likely to continue. Of course, the future direction of the PMI and the outlook for earnings remains tied to the impact of the war and sanctions, among many other factors that include inflation and central bank actions. Further escalation of sanctions may have greater earnings impact; current sanctions have been cautiously implemented to avoid disruption of energy supplies. However, investors may take some comfort that the earnings impact so far has remained modest and global companies appear to be on a path for earnings growth this year.

       "   'content': 'During my eight-years at the IRS, I watched taxpayers make the same mistakes time and again. Not every error will lead to an audit, but you should take pains to be as accurate as possible—and to avoid the following oversights that can lead to heightened scrutiny by the IRS. Red Flag #1: Underreporting income Generally speaking, all income is taxable unless it\\'s specifically excluded, as is the case with certain gifts and inheritances. In most instances, the income you earn will be reported to both you and the government on an information return, such as a Form 1099 or W-2. If the income you report doesn\\'t match the IRS\\'s records, you could face problems down the road—so be sure you include the income from all of the following forms that are applicable to your situation: 1099-B: The form on which financial institutions report capital gains. 1099-DIV: The form on which financial institutions report dividends. 1099-MISC: The form used to report various types of income, such as royalties, rents, and numerous other types of income. 1099-NEC: The form used to report payments to nonemployees, such as independent contractors. 1099-R: The form on which financial institutions report withdrawals from tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Form 1099-INT: The form on which financial institutions report interest income. Form SSA-1099: The form on which the Social Security Administration reports Social Security benefits (a portion of which may be taxable, depending on your level of income). Form W-2: The form on which employers report total annual compensation, payroll taxes, contributions to retirement accounts, and other information. If you receive an inaccurate statement of income, immediately contact the responsible party to request a corrected form and have them resend the documents to both you and the IRS as soon as possible to avoid delaying your tax return. Also, be aware that you must report income for which there is no form, such as renting out your vacation home. Red Flag #2: Misreporting investment gains When you sell an investment, you\\'ll need to know both the cost basis (what you paid for the investment) and the sale price to determine your net gain or loss. The cost basis of your investment may need to be adjusted to account for commissions, fees, stock splits, or other events, which could help reduce your taxable gain or increase your net loss. Financial institutions are required to adjust your investments\\' cost basis and provide that information on a Form 1099. However, brokerages aren\\'t required to report the cost basis for investments purchased prior to a certain date, which means you\\'ll be responsible for supplying that information (see the table below). Be sure to keep records of all investment purchases and sales—even those for which your brokerage is responsible. Your reporting responsibility Depending on security type and date of purchase, you—rather than your brokerage—could be responsible for reporting the cost basis of your investment to the IRS. Red Flag #3: Claiming unsupported deductions The IRS keeps a careful eye on certain tax deductions in order to discourage abuse, particularly if the deduction is especially large or unusual, such as a big donation to a charity. Be sure to keep meticulous records to support the deductions on your tax return, and for charitable donations, verify that the government recognizes any organization that you donate to as a tax-exempt entity. You can confirm an organization\\'s tax status with the IRS\\'s \"Exempt Organizations Select Check\" tool. Red Flag #4: Entering information incorrectly Sometimes, the simplest mistakes cause the biggest headaches. For example, entering the wrong Social Security or tax ID number can cause major problems in processing your return. To guard against such missteps: Review all numbers on your return for accuracy. Check that all the names on the return are spelled correctly. Compare this year\\'s tax return with the last year\\'s, and make sure that there are no unexplained differences or items that were left off. Double-check that you\\'ve signed and dated all relevant pages. Using tax-preparation software can increase the overall accuracy of your return and help identify all the deductions you may be entitled to. However, even the best tax software won\\'t catch basic inputting errors. Consider enlisting a tax professional to give your return a second look or even prepare it from start to finish.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Preferred securities prices have fallen sharply, presenting an attractive entry point for income-oriented investors who can ride out the volatility. Some caution is warranted, however, and we do think prices can fall modestly from here, given the heightened risks. What risks? Well, the Federal Reserve has officially begun its rate hike cycle and the situation in Russia and Ukraine is weighing on sentiment, pulling down the prices of nearly all risk assets. In other words, we\\'re not calling a bottom. But for investors who have been frustrated by the low yields since the Fed dropped rates to near zero in 2020, this has presented an opportunity to lock in higher yields. Yields up, prices down Preferred security yields have risen sharply as their prices have plunged this year—the average yield-to-worst of the ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index is now close to 5%, compared to its 10-year average of just 3.9%. That\\'s up sharply compared to the last year and a half; from July 2020 through December 2021, the average yield of the index was generally below 3%. The drop in price was driven by the double whammy of higher long-term Treasury yields and falling stock prices. Because preferred securities are hybrid securities that share characteristics of both stock and bonds, they are influenced by both markets. The average price of the ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index is now roughly $96, well below its recent peak of $108 in July 2021. While the price plunge may spook investors that currently hold preferreds, we think the entry point is looking more attractive. Over the last 20 years, the average price of the index has rarely been lower than where it is today. There are two clear outliers: the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the pandemic-induced plunge in March 2020. Note that the chart below is truncated at $80 to illustrate where today\\'s price sits relative to non-crisis periods. Over the last 20 years, prices haven\\'t fallen much below current levels Source: Bloomberg, using weekly data as of 3/22/2022. Y axis is truncated at $80 for scale; the actual low was $38.60 on 3/6/2009. Note that average price of the preferred index is rebased to $100, despite many of its underlying holdings having par values of $25. As a result, the price fluctuations of $25 par value preferreds wouldn\\'t likely be as large in dollar terms, but would be similar in percentage terms.) Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The price decline has resulted in one of the worst starts to a calendar year for the ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index—the index is down 7.9% through March 22nd.

Total returns assume reinvestment of interest and capital gains. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. One way to combat interest rate risk with preferreds is by considering variable-rate or adjustable-rate preferreds. These preferreds either have floating coupon rates, or are structured as fixed-to-float, meaning that they begin with a fixed coupon rate and then after a specified amount of time has passed, they reset based on a short-term reference rate. A benefit of these types of preferreds is that they can reduce the interest rate risk and help limit the price declines if interest rates continue to rise. They aren\\'t insulated from all risks though—they still have credit risk just like fixed-rated preferreds. But the lower interest rate risk has helped them outperform traditional preferreds since the beginning of 2020.

Low prices can mean higher total returns, but expect a lot of volatility Historically, a lower starting price translates to a higher total return over the next 12 months, as the chart below illustrates. The average returns are just that—averages—and they can still fluctuate, sometimes wildly, given the riskier nature of preferred securities. Focusing on the average starting price between $95 and $100, the average forward 52-week total return was close to 9%, but the worst return in that starting range was a 58% loss during the financial crisis. Low prices have generally translated to higher returns down the road Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research and Bloomberg. Forward 52-week total returns of the ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index using weekly data from 5/5/1989 through 3/18/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The recent price declines represent a potentially attractive opportunity for investors who can ride out some heightened volatility going forward. While the entry point looks attractive, we\\'d caution that additional price declines are still possible. Risks are still elevated One reason that additional price declines are possible is due to the changing characteristics of the preferred market over the years, such as the average coupon rate. With the declining trend of interest rates and bond yields for the past few decades, preferred issuers have been able to issue securities with lower coupons. The average coupon rate of the preferred index is just over 5% today, compared with more than 7% just 10 years ago. Given the lower coupon rate, that makes the price of the index more sensitive to rising interest rates. All else equal, a lower coupon rate increases an investment\\'s duration, a measure of interest rate sensitivity. If long-term yields continue to rise modestly, that could pull prices a little lower. Credit risk—the risk that an issuer can\\'t make timely coupon or principal payments—is high, as well. You can see that through the rising spreads. A spread is the amount of yield an investment, like a bond or preferred security, offers above a comparable Treasury to compensate for the additional risks of holding that investment. The average spread of the preferred index has risen lately, but it\\'s still below some of the previous peaks over the last 10 years. Since a spread can be considered an indication of risk—when economic conditions are deteriorating, investors tend to require higher spreads over Treasuries—they may drift modestly higher given concerns about tighter financial conditions and the risks from the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Spreads are a component of a preferred security\\'s yield, so higher spreads would likely result in lower prices. We\\'re not expecting spreads to rise meaningfully higher, however, since corporate fundamentals remain strong. U.S. banks, one of the largest issuers of preferred securities, remain well-capitalized, supported by the results of the 2021 Fed stress tests. A flat yield curve and credit concerns stemming from the Russia/Ukraine situation pose a risk to banks, but overall they\\'re in good shape to remain current on their coupon payments. Also consider the credit quality of any preferred security investment. Preferreds issued by large financial institutions tend to have credit ratings at the low end of the investment-grade scale or the high end of the sub-investment-grade spectrum, also called high-yield or \"junk.\" The average credit rating of the securities in the ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index is \"BBB.\" Our outlook here is for those preferreds that fall in that range; there are lot of smaller preferred securities that have lower ratings or no ratings at all, and we consider them riskier. Spreads do have a little room to rise Source: Bloomberg, using weekly data as of 3/18/2022. Option-adjusted spreads are quoted as a fixed spread, or differential, over U.S. Treasury issues. OAS is a method used in calculating the relative value of a fixed income security containing an embedded option, such as a borrower\\'s option to prepay a loan. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. What to do now Income-oriented investors who can handle heightened volatility should consider preferreds today. But before you dive in, understand that risks are still elevated. The risk of higher long-term yields as the Fed continues to hike rates could mean preferred yields go up (and prices down). Also, geopolitical risks could result in a flight-to-safety, where investors shift to more conservative investments and out of riskier investments like preferreds. That could pull prices lower, as well. But for those investors who can ride out the ups and down, preferred securities appear attractive. With an average yield-to-worst of roughly 5%, the ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index offers higher yields than most fixed income investments today. We always suggest that investors consider preferreds as long-term investments given their long maturity dates, or no maturity dates at all. There are a number of ways to invest in preferred securities. Schwab clients can use the Preferred Shares Screener, can search for funds using the ETF Screener or Mutual Fund Screener, or explore funds on the ETF Select List, searching for funds under the \"Preferred Stock\" category. You can also consider a separately managed account.'}],\n",

       "   'abstract': 'What can a new investor learn from fishing? You might be surprised.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, You know my dad is an avid investor. But did you know he's also an avid fly fisherman? He used to take me fishing and really tried to get me hooked. (Pun intended!) I have to admit I wasn't a natural. It seemed kind of slow and tying the knots was a real challenge. Investing, of course, was a different story. When my dad introduced me to stocks, dare I say I went for it hook, line and sinker? Now, you may understandably be wondering why I bring up fishing. Well, as I see it, there are a lot of lessons from fishing that can apply to investing. So whether you're a seasoned investor or a newbie just ready to get your feet wet, I think you'll find some of these lessons interesting, fun—maybe even inspiring. You first have to put your line in the water Whether you want to catch a fish or build your wealth, if you sit and wait for the right conditions before casting your line, chances are nothing will happen. So don't just think about it, get invested. It doesn't have to be a big commitment. You can start by staying close to shore with just a small investment. Once you get used to the water—and the market—you can decide to go in a little deeper. It helps if you fish in the right pond When my kids were little my dad took them fishing in a stocked pond. Of course they always caught something and felt like winners. Obviously that's not going to happen with investing, but you can increase your odds of success by choosing low-cost investments that match your goals and feelings about risk. Do some research before you start investing so you're more confident that you're putting your money in the right place. Cast a wide net Fishing in a single spot or investing in a single stock can dramatically decrease your results. Sure you might get lucky, but the best bet for an investor is casting your net over a wide range of investments. Fortunately, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) make it easy to create a diversified portfolio. For instance, a new investor with a long time horizon could get started with a broad-based index stock mutual fund or ETF. Want to increase your odds of success even more? Diversify internationally and across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash, commodities), sectors and industries. Patience is part of the process I admit I didn't have much patience when it came to fishing. I wanted to make a catch and be done. Instant gratification. Well, if you're an angler, you know that's not how it works. And that's certainly not how it works in investing. Being patient and taking a long-term view is essential. Getting in and out of the market quickly or overreacting to market volatility is a mistake. As they say, time in the market is more important than timing the market. So think about how long you can keep your money invested. Money you'll need in the next 3-5 years generally shouldn't be invested in stocks. It's money for long-term goals like retirement that's most suited for stock investing. But it's not just putting the money in the market, it's keeping it there. That's where patience comes in—and compounding pays off. Be prepared—and prepare for surprises Successful fishing requires the right gear and tackle. The same holds for investing. Of course, you need the right accounts and the right types of investments for you, but there's more. And what about a map so you know where you're headed? An overall financial plan that includes budgeting, saving, insurance, and debt control are all part of the map that will get you safely to your financial goals. But just like a change in the wind or weather can take you by surprise, an unexpected health issue or job change can throw you off course. An emergency fund of three to six months’ cash to cover essential expenses can help keep you afloat until a financial storm passes. Get help tying those knots Whether you're a beginning investor or wading into riskier investment waters, you'll feel more confident if you have someone to help you. My dad was my investing guide when I got started. In the same way, an experienced friend or family member may be able to give you a few pointers. If you really want help untangling some of the more complex aspects of investing, check in with a financial advisor. Even a one-time consultation can keep you from getting in over your head. Here's one more comparison I think is relevant: Investing, like fishing, is filled with stories about the one that got away. But you won't have any stories to share if you don't give it a try. So if you're thinking about investing, I say cast your line now! Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'You\\'ve researched the nuts and bolts of cryptocurrencies and considered whether you should invest in them. Now you want to participate in the cryptocurrencies market. How do you do it? There are several ways you can get indirect exposure to cryptocurrencies through Schwab. Although you cannot directly buy or sell Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency at Schwab (nor do we accept or disburse cryptocurrencies for settlement of securities or futures transactions), Schwab provides several ways to access cryptocurrency markets: Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds: ETFs and mutual funds currently provide indirect exposure to cryptocurrency through crypto futures contracts and/or the stocks of companies participating in cryptocurrency and blockchain activities. Consider: Equity-based ETFs: Some ETFs, such as the Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF, offer exposure to companies involved in the development or utilization of cryptocurrencies, digital assets, blockchain, and distributed ledger technologies. Others may invest in the stocks of companies that mine cryptocurrencies, offer cryptocurrency trading, hold cryptocurrency on their balance sheets, or accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment. Futures-based mutual funds and ETFs: Like all ETFs investing in futures contracts, buyers should be aware that \"roll\" costs (replacing an expiring contract with a longer-dated contract) may result in lower returns compared to owning the underlying commodity or cryptocurrency directly. Furthermore, position limits designed to restrict the quantity of futures contracts that may be held by any single investor (including a fund) may affect this type of ETF\\'s ability to create new shares (depending on the size of the ETF and the size of the Bitcoin futures market). In addition to new funds that have been launched specifically to offer exposure to cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance technologies, some existing commodities-focused ETFs and mutual funds are also adding Bitcoin exposure to their portfolios. Cryptocurrency coin trusts: Over-the-counter cryptocurrency trusts allow investors to trade shares in trusts holding large pools of a cryptocurrency, although these can involve high volatility, hefty fees, and other risks. Typically, these products are launched as private placements to accredited investors. Once holding period requirements are met, accredited investors may sell their shares in the \"over-the-counter\" market to all investors, including smaller retail investors. Historically, these products have tended to trade at large premiums or discounts to the value of their underlying assets due to their limited ability to match the demand for shares with the available supply (i.e., those shares for which the holding period has been met). Bitcoin futures: Bitcoin futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specific quantity of Bitcoin at a specified price on a particular future date. Schwab clients with a futures account can trade Bitcoin futures contracts directly. Traded contracts are settled in cash, not cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency stocks: Some stocks provide indirect exposure to cryptocurrency due to the company\\'s relationship to digital assets. Bottom line Many aspects of the cryptocurrency market are still immature in ways that may pose risks for our clients and for Schwab—and while President Joe Biden signed an executive order in March 2022, outlining the U.S. government\\'s objectives, policies, and actions regarding cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and other digital financial instruments, and a handful of bills have been proposed in Congress, it will likely be a while before U.S. regulators can clarify their approach. When there is more regulatory guidance, you can expect Schwab to have more investment options for clients, potentially including spot cryptocurrency trading and custody. If we do bring new solutions to market, you can—as always—expect them to be designed to support clients\\' needs, and to be surrounded by the advice and education our clients deserve and have come to expect from us.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Unfunded pension liabilities for state and local governments are in their best condition in nearly a decade, supporting the case that credit quality in the municipal bond market has improved.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Unfunded pensions for state and local governments were once expected by some to sink the whole market. That never happened. Instead, unfunded pension liabilities are in their best condition in nearly a decade, according to Pew Charitable Trusts, and are less of a financial burden on many state and local governments. The improvement in pension liabilities supports the case that credit quality in the muni market has improved and is strong overall. How do pensions work? The state or local governments that provide pensions must contribute and invest funds to pay for future benefits. The employees usually must contribute, as well. Future benefits are based on a variety of factors such as projected retirement dates, growth in salaries and life expectancies. Municipal pension plans vary in terms of funding levels, annual expenses, and the ability and willingness to fully fund their plans. If the value of a plan\\'s assets falls, or the future retirement benefits promised become more expensive, the municipality generally must contribute more. Those costs compete with other costs, such as other public services or debt payments. Large payments to pensions can take funds away from payments to other resources—such as keeping the municipality operating, or making payments to bondholders. If pension expenses become too burdensome, the municipality risks defaulting on its bonds. Each plan has a different \"funded ratio,\" which offers a snapshot of the amount of future assets available to meet projected future needs. Most state and local government plans haven\\'t set aside all the assets required to meet 100% of the needs of future retirees, as the map below shows, which isn\\'t an immediate concern in our view. A ratio of 80% is generally considered as a well-funded plan. Some plans are better funded than others. However, state pension plans are in much better shape today due to increased contributions and strong market gains. The improvement in state pensions has helped improve the credit conditions of many states. Mind the pension-funded gap 2020 funded ratio (%) for states’ pension liabilities Source: S&P Capital IQ, as of September 20, 2021. A few points to keep in mind: 1. Pension expenses are manageable for most municipalities The good news is that in general, states have the financial resources to make payments to both their pension plans and bondholders. However, as shown in the chart below, the amount of each state\\'s revenues that go toward fixed costs, including pensions, varies. For example, Connecticut spent 28% of the revenue it generated on debt service, other post-employment benefits (OPEBs) like health care in retirement, and pension contributions in fiscal year 2020. The remaining revenue went toward other things like operations and state-run programs. This compares to North Dakota, which only spent 1.1% of the revenue it generated on similar fixed costs. Payments on debt account for a low portion of governmental revenues for many states Debt service ratio based on fiscal year 2020 own-source revenues Source: Source: Moody’s Investors Service, as of September 20, 2021 2. The strong equity market combined with increased contributions have helped shore up plans State and local government pension plans have in aggregate about 60% their investments in stocks, according to Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service. Since the low on March 23, 2020, the S&P 500 is up 92.4% which has contributed to the significant improvement in pension funding levels and caused many plans to exceed their investing benchmark. For example, CalPERS, the California Public Employee\\'s Retirement System, the largest plan in the nation, earned a net return of 13.3% for the calendar year 2021, which exceeded its benchmark by 1.20%. Although investment returns helped improve the financial position of CalPERS, it\\'s still not fully funded as illustrated in the map above. When a plan outperforms its investment benchmark, it can take some of the financial pressure off the municipality because it doesn\\'t have to contribute as much to the plan. This frees up financial resources that can go toward debt service. This is a credit positive and can lead to ratings upgrades and improve the prices of existing bonds. Many municipalities have used the recent strong economic recovery and substantial fiscal aid to help shore up their unfunded pension liabilities. For example, contributions have increased an average of 8% per year. Even some of the plans with the lowest funding have made significant improvements to contributions to get their plans on better footing. Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey have all increased contributions by an average of 16%. For the first time in 20 years, states are projected to have collectively contributed enough funds to be able to pay current benefits as well as reduce pension debt. The ability to pay current benefits while also reducing pension debt is a situation known as \"positive amortization.\" If a state has achieved positive amortization, its pension liability is expected to decline and become less of a financial burden. As of 2019, which is the most recent date for individual state data, 35 states have achieved positive amortization of pension debt. This is up from 16 states in 2014. Most states contributed enough to their pensions to make current contributions and pay down debt Source: Pew Charitable Trusts, 2019 State Data which is the most recent data available for all states, report as of September 14, 2021. States with \"negative amortization\" contributed less than 90% of the contribution needed to pay current benefits and pay down debt. States with \"stable amortization\" contributed between 90% and 100%, and states with \"positive amortization\" contributed more than 100%. 3. Many states and local governments have been taking action to reduce expenses In addition to stepping up contributions, plans have been taking other actions to reduce the financial burden that unfunded pension liabilities may pose. Nearly every state has enacted reforms—such as reducing benefits—to their pensions, according to Pew Charitable Trusts. The most common reform is to reduce the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for retirees, which in turn reduces the projected liability. Steps like these can free up money for debt service, because the state or local government can scale back current contributions for future pension obligations. Reducing benefits can be difficult, because most states have legal protections that apply to pension benefits for current employees and retirees, but these protections are not uniform among states. For example, Illinois’ state constitution says that pension benefits \"shall not be diminished or impaired,\" which has limited the state\\'s ability to address its large liability. Texas, on the other hand, has less strict protections for state-administered plans,1 making it easier to address its liability. No state, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, protects benefits for future employees—meaning that new employees may not be offered a pension plan but instead a defined-contribution retirement plan, similar to a 401(k), where the burden to fund the employee\\'s retirement is mostly the employee\\'s responsibility. What to do now There\\'s no denying that large unfunded pensions pose a burden to some municipalities, but the risk overall is lower today relative to the last decade. To help limit the risk they may pose to your investments, consider the following: Watch the credit rating. A municipal bond\\'s credit rating historically has been a very good indicator of its ability to meet near-term debt payments. Consider signing up for email ratings alerts on Schwab.com. These alerts should help you stay up to date on your municipal bonds. If you own individual bonds, and your bond is downgraded, it warrants additional attention as to why it was downgraded. Multi-notch downgrades are especially important to pay attention to, in our view. Also watch the bond\\'s yield. Generally, the market is aware of which states and municipalities are struggling more with large unfunded pension liabilities and therefore require higher yields on the bonds they issue. For example, the state of Illinois\\' pension plan is roughly 38% funded as of 2020 and payments toward debt and retirement liabilities account for nearly a quarter of the state\\'s own source revenues. As a result, the yield for a State of Illinois 10-year general obligation (GO) bond is 120 basis points above a AAA benchmark. This compares to 29 basis points for the state of California, whose plan is 71% funded and whose payments to fixed costs account for 13% of own-source revenues. Be cautious toward a bond that is yielding far more than other bonds of similar credit quality and maturity, all else equal. Bonds for states with large unfunded liabilities and less financial flexibility generally yield more Source: Bloomberg, Moody’s Investors Services, and Standard and Poor’s. Data as of March 16, 2022. Do your homework. If you\\'re a Schwab client researching a muni bond on Schwab.com, you can find recent disclosures, material events and financial statements in MuniDOCS®, which is under the Offering Documents and Material Events section. One thing to note: Muni disclosures have historically faced delays in being released and can be cumbersome to analyze. Consider choosing a professional manager to do the homework for you. If you don\\'t want to monitor credit conditions for multiple individual issuers, you\\'re not alone. We believe professional management by bond fund managers or separately managed accounts can make sense. A professional manager can monitor issues that could cause problems—such as unmanaged pension liabilities or other credit risks. Diversify. While we do not expect to see a significant increase in defaults or distress caused by pensions or post-employment costs, try to avoid too much exposure to any single issuer. We suggest owning 10 or more individual issuers, at minimum. 1 Accruals in many locally-administered plans are protected under the Texas constitution, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Even if a recession is not imminent, the playbook deserves a dusting off as rising inflation, tighter monetary policy, and the war in Ukraine all crimp economic growth prospects.',\n",
       "   'content': 'The last time I wrote about the risk of recession was in August 2019, although what ultimately tipped the economy into one six months later—the pandemic—was impossible to anticipate at that time. Given the Federal Reserve\\'s shift to tighter monetary policy, the impact of rampant inflation on growth, and now the deleterious impact of Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, dusting off the recession playbook is in order. What say you, leading indicators? The Conference Board\\'s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is among the most reliable gauges of turning points in business cycles. Given the nature of its 10 subcomponents (more on that later), the broad index\\'s moves generally signal when economic activity has reached a peak, trough, or slowdown. Given the nature of this report, it is perhaps apt to remind investors of our oft-expressed view that, when it comes to the relationship between economic data and the stock market, better or worse tends to matter more than good or bad. In other words, the rate of change in the data is often where we can look for inflection points—that is, what provides the \"tell\" as to whether we\\'re entering a new phase of the cycle. As such, if we look at the LEI in year-over-year-change terms, shown in the chart below, you can see that the latest reading of 7.6% in February is strong relative to history, though off the boil of 12.3% in April 2021. Base effects have helped up until this point—given the change in February 2021 was -0.9%— but comparisons will inevitably become more difficult moving forward. The economy is now also facing several headwinds from Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine and weakening trends among subcomponents. The current change has yet to reach the average -1.4% reading in the month prior to past recessions. That is by no means a definitive threshold to guarantee the end of the cycle, given the wide historical range, but it tells us (for now) that there may still be a good portion of runway left. Follow the leader Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, The Conference Board, as of 2/28/2022. As mentioned, trends are often more important than levels as possible inflection points. Thus, peeling back the LEI onion one layer exposes flags (a couple of red, otherwise mostly yellow) that are worth noting. Shown in the first portion of the table below are the 10 subcomponents of the LEI. While levels are generally healthy or fair (with the exception of average consumer expectations for business conditions), trends look less impressive. Key to watch will be the emergence of additional worsening trends. Historically, a consistent sea of red in the \"trend\" column has preceded weakness in the \"level\" column and, eventually, a deterioration in the Coincident Economic Index (CEI), which is shown in the bottom portion of the table. Looking to the trend-setters Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, The Conference Board, as of 3/18/2022. For illustrative purposes only. What a recession is and isn\\'t The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)—the official arbiters of U.S. recessions—defines a recession as \"a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\" The definition of a recession is not two quarters in a row of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth; although many believe that is the \"traditional\" definition (it isn\\'t). Not coincidentally, the four components of the CEI are what the NBER primarily monitors: \"The determination of the months of peaks and troughs is based on a range of monthly measures of aggregate real economic activity … [including] real personal income less transfers, nonfarm payroll employment, employment as measured by the household survey, real personal consumption expenditures, wholesale-retail sales adjusted for price changes, and industrial production.\" The NBER\\'s assessment is always made retroactively, as the committee looks back to the peak in activity as end of the cycle and beginning of the recession. Thus, while both the trend and level of the CEI look strong right now, they don\\'t tell us much about where we\\'re headed. It\\'s tempting to find comfort in the fact that data look strong/good, but the reality is that deterioration in trends often lurks in the background and can spread rather quickly. So far, so good, but investors should probably swap their \"level\" lenses for their \"trend\" lenses right now. Consumers\\' confidence on shaky ground The Conference Board also conducts the monthly Consumer Confidence survey, which has a number of component parts. In addition to the \"headline\" reading of confidence broadly, there are sub-questions about consumers\\' present situation confidence vs. their confidence about the future (the expectations component). Shown below, the spread between the two—with expectations quite a bit worse than consumers\\' assessment of their present situation—has never been this low in history without a recession either pending in fairly short order, or already underway. Consumers\\' dour expectations Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, The Conference Board, as of 2/28/2022. Counter-cyclical inflation It\\'s no wonder consumers are feeling glum, with hits having come from the pandemic and now exacerbated by inflation, tighter financial conditions and the Russia/Ukraine war. We believe the current environment is better described as counter-cyclical (or cost-push) inflation—when high prices put downward pressure on demand/growth—than 1970s-era stagflation. That said, it is worth keeping an eye on the Misery Index, which was born in that era and simply adds the inflation rate to the unemployment rate. Misery Index up, but not high Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2/28/2022. Unemployment rate as lagging indicator For now, the unemployment rate is not the culprit in terms of the move up in the Misery Index, but it is worth watching in the context of a possible recession. One of the most frequent questions we get when discussing recession risks is, \"How could a recession be possible with the unemployment rate so low?\" Remember, the unemployment rate is one of the most lagging of all economic indicators. As shown in the top chart below, the unemployment rate has always been near its trough each cycle heading into recessions. A rising unemployment rate doesn\\'t cause recessions, recessions cause the unemployment rate to rise. In turn, as shown, recessions have always ended with the unemployment rate near its peak—and in many cases, it was still rising after recessions had ended. Unemployment rate lags recessions Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2/28/2022. Below is a table highlighting the relationship between recessions and the unemployment rate. There has historically only been an average 0.3% increase in the unemployment rate by the first month of recessions. In fact, there have even been instances where a recession was declared as having begun, yet the unemployment rate was still at its trough, like in 1981. In sum, don’t take economic turning point cues from highly lagging indicators. Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2/28/2022. Slow yield curve inversion underway? As mentioned at the start of this report, the Fed\\'s shift to start normalizing monetary policy—and the attendant tightening of financial conditions—is generally a good reason to dust off the recession playbook. Yield curve inversions have historically been a reliable precursor to recessions. The spread between 10-year and 3-month Treasury yields remains fairly steep; however, the spread between 10-year and 2-year yields, shown below, is only about 20 basis points from being inverted. Inversions in that spread often pre-date inversions in the 10-year, 3-month curve. Flattening yield curve Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 3/18/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. According to Capital Economics\\' Recession Probability Models, the 10y-3m spread implies a 5% probability, while the 10y-2y spread implies a 20% probability. Regardless of which spread you look at, there are two important caveats with regard to recession risk: The very brief inversion in 1998 was not followed by a recession (in part because the Fed began cutting rates in the aftermath of the Asian currency/Russian debt default/failure of LTCM hedge fund crises) The lead time of 10y-2y yield curve inversions relative to recessions is quite variable. There have been six official recessions since 1978 and the average span between inversion and recession was 12 months, with a range of six to 22 months. Yield curve inversions are often viewed as a cause of recessions, when in fact, they are better thought of as a symptom of the conditions that tend to lead into recessions. On the other hand, spikes in oil prices have historically been a cause of recessions. The chart below shows the real (inflation-adjusted) Bloomberg crude oil price percentage change from its 24-month moving average. As you can see (denoted by the yellow dotted line), only once (in August 2005) since the early 1970s did the change move above 50% without a recession on its way or already underway. Oil\\'s slippery slope Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 2/28/2022. Y-axis is truncated for visuals purposes. Recessions often hold key to length/magnitude of bear markets The S&P 500 has, so far, avoided a bear market using the traditional -20% from a peak (the same can\\'t be said for either the NASDAQ or Russell 2000). Looking ahead, if a recession becomes increasingly likely (not a layup call), it would likely mean more equity market pain is in store. Using Ned Davis Research\\'s data for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has history back to 1900, shown below is the difference in the severity and length of bear markets depending on whether a recession occurred or not. You can see the percentage loss and length in market days for every bear market with or without a recession (the red and green dots, respectively); and the mean loss/length (red and green squares). In comparison to all bear markets (black square), bears without recessions were shorter (213 days) and less severe (-25.4%) relative to bears with recessions, which were longer (353 days) and more severe (-34.6%). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Using a more \"modern\" era of the past 50 years, the spread between recession and non-recession bear markets is wider. Recession bear markets had an average decline of 32.8% and an average length of 17.4 months, while non-recession bear markets had an average decline of only 18%, with an average duration of only 6.8 months. Will Fed hike until \"something breaks\"? Since the 1970s, there have been three primary reasons why tightening cycles have been followed by recessions: Exogenous shock hits (like in 2020 alongside the onset of the pandemic). Easy monetary policy leading to economic overheating and/or bubbles inflating (like in 2007-2008 and 2000-2001). Inflation \"allowed\" to spiral, with aggressive tightening of monetary policy necessarily following (like in the late-1970s/early-1980s). Economic data has been generally weakening recently, which is likely to persist, increasing recession probabilities. A recession is not yet the base case, but it is time to put it back on our radar screens. In pre-recession periods, higher-quality, higher-free cash flow and lower-volatility factors tend to outperform (as has been the case since the Fed announced balance sheet tapering last November). The recent rally had a lower-quality, higher-volatility flavor to it. It\\'s too soon to make a judgement that this market message is indicative of lower recession risk or just bottom-fishing among some of the harder-hit areas of the market during the correction. A notable risk in this cycle is associated with the Fed\\'s need to move further off the zero bound on rates and start shrinking its balance sheet amid elevated inflation pressures. The Fed\\'s eye is now clearly on inflation, and no longer on supporting the economy as it emerged from the worst part of the pandemic. In fact, the Fed is actively pursuing tighter financial conditions and a slowing in aggregate economic demand. Last week\\'s easing in financial conditions, alongside the stock market rally and weaker dollar, is unlikely to have legs longer-term. This is a unique period in that the Fed has embarked on a rate hiking cycle with inflation this high, and growth expectations as low as they are presently (Atlanta Fed\\'s GDPNow forecast is only 1.3% for first quarter real growth). It\\'s always difficult for the Fed to land the economic \"plane\" softly; perhaps even more difficult in today\\'s unique inflation environment and with the added kicker of the Russia/Ukraine war. In sum The U.S. economy exited the lockdown phase of the pandemic with an incredibly sharp acceleration, which persisted until late last year. The health of the labor (and housing) market offers some tailwinds against the headwinds of inflation and Fed policy, but bouts of equity market volatility (and weakness) are likely to persist. The recent stock market rally has had a better breadth tone to it and sentiment remains dour (a contrarian indicator). However, given the unique uncertainties of the day, this is not an environment to take on excess risk. Instead, stick close to strategic asset allocations and benchmark sector allocations—using the disciplines of diversification and periodic rebalancing to navigate heightened volatility.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Bouts of market volatility are an unnerving, but normal, feature of long-term investing. They\\'re not fun, but you can expect to see market declines periodically throughout your investing career. Yet it\\'s hard to sit still when the market is sliding. You can’t help but think: \"Shouldn\\'t I be doing something?\" Every investor is different, but here are a few steps that everyone should consider. During market volatility: Resist the urge to sell based solely on recent market movements. Selling stocks when markets drop can make temporary losses permanent. Staying the course, while difficult emotionally, may be healthier for your portfolio. This doesn\\'t mean you should hold on blindly, but we suggest taking into account an investment\\'s future prospects and the role it plays in your portfolio, rather than being guided by noise and fear. Take the long view. Markets typically go up and down, and you\\'re likely to experience several significant declines during a long investing career. But even bear markets—that is, periods when the market fell by more than 20%—historically have been relatively short when compared to bull markets. Because timing the market\\'s ups and downs is nearly impossible, but all investors would do well to ignore the noise and stay focused on their plans. Past bear markets have tended to be shorter than bull markets Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Bloomberg. Data as of 12/31/2021. The market is represented by daily price returns of the S&P 500 index. Bear markets are defined as periods with cumulative declines of at least 20% from the previous peak close. Its duration is measured as the number of days from the previous peak close to the lowest close reached after it has fallen at least 20%, and includes weekends and holidays. Periods between bear markets are designated as bull markets. Indices are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Review your risk tolerance and your risk capacity Risk tolerance is your ability to emotionally handle big price swings; risk capacity is your financial ability to take a loss. Market downturns can be a wake-up call to reconsider your risk tolerance, although we recommend waiting until you\\'re calm. Risk capacity, however, can—and should—be considered at any time. Do you have enough cash to handle near-term goals? Money that you’ll need soon or that you can’t afford to lose shouldn\\'t be in the stock market—it\\'s best invested in relatively stable assets, such as money market funds, certificates of deposit (CDs), or Treasury bills. If you\\'re retired, having your next 12 months of living expenses in a bank account or money market fund—and a few more years\\' worth in bonds that mature when you need the money—can help you stay calm when stock markets are not. Make sure you have a diversified portfolio Volatile markets also can reveal that portfolios their owners thought were appropriately diversified in fact aren\\'t. If you haven\\'t looked at your portfolio recently to make sure you understand what each asset class is doing and that the mix matches your target asset allocation, now is a good time to become reacquainted with it. Schwab\\'s investor profile questionnaire can help you determine your profile and match it to an appropriate target asset allocation. Consider including defensive assets for more stability Defensive assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, Treasury securities and other U.S. government bonds, can help stabilize a portfolio when stocks are slipping. Also, if you expect to spend from your portfolio within the next few years, it\\'s a good idea to keep that money in assets that historically have been relatively liquid and less volatile than stocks, such as cash and short-term bonds. This can help you avoid having to sell in a down market. Rebalance your portfolio as needed Market changes can skew your allocation from its original target. Over time, assets that have gained in value will account for more of your portfolio, while those that have declined will account for less. Rebalancing means selling positions that have become overweight in relation to the rest of your portfolio, and moving the proceeds to positions that have become underweight. It’s a good idea to do this at regular intervals. Adapt your trading to fast-moving markets If you must trade during volatile markets, take current conditions into account when entering orders. Be careful when trading during the first and last hours of the trading session, which tend to be the most volatile. Trade smaller positions, and consider \"scaling\" in or out of positions by buying or selling stock in increments as the price fluctuates. There are defensive steps you can take to protect an unrealized gain or limit potential losses on an existing position, such as stop orders and stop-limit orders.1 These can help make your decision-making more automatic and less reliant on doing the right thing in the heat of the moment. 1 There is no guarantee that execution of a stop order will be at or near the stop price.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Bull markets can run for a long time—but they can\\'t run forever. And when a bull stops running, it\\'s better to be prepared than surprised. So how do you prepare? Here are seven things to do: 1. Know that you have the resources to weather a crisis \"Some people panic in a bear market because they don\\'t know whether they have enough cash to handle near-term goals,\" says Mark Riepe, managing director of the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Ideally, you won\\'t have to face this question in a crisis—because you should know the answer. If you\\'re retired, knowing that you have the next 12 months of living expenses in a bank account or money market fund—and a few more years\\' worth in bonds that mature when you need the money—can help keep you calm and clear-headed, Mark says. \"You\\'re going to react a lot differently than someone who gets blindsided and has never laid that groundwork. It’s not just about your risk tolerance, which is your ability to emotionally handle big price swings and losses,\" he adds. \"It\\'s about your financial capacity to handle risk. In other words, can you afford to take a loss?\" You might feel risk tolerant, but if you haven\\'t structured your investments to handle a sharp drop, you may have to make painful adjustments to your lifestyle when the crisis happens. 2. Match your money to your goals Map out a plan that takes into account what you\\'re saving for, whether near-term expenses or future financial goals like college tuition or retirement. Structure your portfolio to match those goals. Money that you’ll need in the short term or that you can\\'t afford to lose—the down payment on a home, for example—is best invested in relatively stable assets, such as money market funds, certificates of deposit (CDs), or Treasury bills. Goals that need funding in three to five years should be addressed with a mixture of investment-grade bonds and CDs. For money you won\\'t need for five or more years, consider assets with the potential to grow, such as stocks, which are more volatile. 3. Remember: Downturns don\\'t last The Schwab Center for Financial Research looked at both bull and bear markets for the S&P 500® Index going back to the late \\'60s and found that the average bull ran for about six years, delivering an average cumulative return of over 200%. The average bear market lasted roughly 15 months, delivering an average cumulative loss of 38.4%. The longest of the bears was a little more than two years—and was followed by a nearly five-year bull run. The shortest was the pandemic-fueled bear market in early 2020, which lasted a mere 33 days. Past bear markets have tended to be shorter than bull markets Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Bloomberg as of 12/31/2021. The market is represented by daily price returns of the S&P 500 index. Bear markets are defined as periods with cumulative declines of at least 20% from the previous peak close. Its duration is measured as the number of days from the previous peak close to the lowest close reached after it has fallen at least 20%, and includes weekends and holidays. Periods between bear markets are designated as bull markets. Indices are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. How does this impact your bear market kit? Even if you find yourself headed into the second year of a bear market, remember that it won’t last. No bull market endures forever; neither does a bear. And historically, the market\\'s upward movement has tended to prevail over the declines long term. 4. Keep your portfolio diversified Let\\'s say there is a slump—is there a remedy to help your portfolio get back on its feet? Being well diversified can help cushion against losses. In every bear market there are likely certain segments of the markets that get hit much harder than others. It\\'s extremely difficult to forecast these ahead of time, so a preventive measure you can take now is to diversify within the equity market as well as across asset classes. Consider the assets you\\'ve set aside for medium-term needs or goals. Being diversified means you have a wide variety of investment-grade bonds—corporate, municipals, Treasuries, and possibly foreign issues. And they should have varying maturity dates, from short-term to mid-term, so you always have some bonds maturing and providing you with either income or money to reinvest. Your long-term assets should be divvied up among a wide array of domestic stocks—big and small, fast-growing and dividend-paying—as well as international stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and commodities, says Mark. That mix gives you exposure to asset classes that tend to move at different times and speeds, he says. 5. Don\\'t miss out on market rebounds \"It\\'s easy to say that risk doesn\\'t bother you when the markets are near all-time highs,\" says Mark. \"A better indicator is how you behaved in the last downturn.\" Many investors sold at the bottom of the market in March 2009, turning temporary paper losses into real, wealth-crushing losses. Mutual fund outflows were about $21.6 billion that month, according to the Investment Company Institute. Investors who failed to get back in the market in a timely fashion would have missed the beginning of one of the strongest bull markets in history. To get a sense of what\\'s at stake when you pull out of the market, even temporarily, during the average bear market, the Schwab Center for Financial Research compared the returns from four hypothetical portfolios: One that remained 100% invested in stocks as the market touched its bear-market low and then rebounded. (While we recommend diversifying your portfolio with a mix of assets appropriate for your goals and risk tolerance, we\\'re focusing on stocks here to illustrate the impact of market timing.) One that was diverted to short-term T-bills for a month after the market bottomed before returning to a 100% stock allocation. One that was diverted to T-bills for three months after the market bottomed before returning to a 100% stock allocation. One that was diverted to T-bills for six months after the market bottomed before returning to a 100% stock allocation. As you can see in the table below, the all-stock portfolio was the best performer and was still delivering higher returns than the other portfolios three years after the market bottomed. But investors in that all-stock portfolio had to stay invested at literally the lowest point of the market cycle. Those who waited until the skies were clearer (e.g., a month after the low point of the cycle, or three months, or even six months) still participated in the recovery, but at a far smaller rate. Bear market recoveries are often front-loaded Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data from Morningstar, Inc. \"Fully invested\" in the market is represented by the S&P 500® Total Return Index, using data from January 1970 – March 2021. T-bills are represented by the total returns of the Ibbotson U.S. 30-day Treasury Bill Index. Since 1970, there have been a total of six periods where the market dropped by 20% or more. The cumulative return for each period and scenario is calculated as the simple average of the cumulative returns from each period and scenario. Indices are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no indication of future results. Timing the market is very difficult—no one knows for sure when the bottom will come—so if you can tolerate it, riding out a bear market may be worth it. 6. Include cash in your kit Cash is one of the lowest-returning asset classes, but don\\'t let that blind you to its long-term potential as an agent of diversification in your portfolio. Cash has a very low correlation to other asset classes, so it can offer protection against volatility. Another advantage: Cash reserves can come in handy in down markets. With cash you can buy in when prices are attractively low—without having to sell securities at a loss, if they are also at a low point. So cash can provide your portfolio with some stability (low correlation, low volatility) and flexibility (to buy new investments without selling old ones cheap). 7. Find a financial professional you can count on Finally, your bear market kit could benefit from having a built-in buddy system, so to speak. Meaning, if you\\'re not sure how to structure your portfolio correctly, or you think you\\'d be tempted to do something rash in a market slide, you should find a financial professional you trust to collaborate with you. That person can walk you through a complete portfolio review and help prepare you and your portfolio for times when the market gets tough.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My daughter is 16 and has her first paying job as well as stock dividends and capital gains from a small investment account. Does she need to file a separate tax return? —A Reader Dear Reader, Congratulations to your daughter—and to you. A first job and exposure to the stock market are both big steps toward financial independence and personal responsibility. And of course, learning about taxes is another part of everyone’s financial education. So let\\'s take a look at when a teen needs to—or should—file their own return. Then I\\'ll get into ways you can help your daughter learn to manage her money wisely—which, to me, is the most important lesson of all. Basic guidelines for filing a teen\\'s tax return There are three factors that determine whether your daughter needs to file a separate tax return. First, look at the IRS criteria for being a dependent: She must be under 19, or under age 24 and a full-time student, or permanently disabled at any age; She must live with you more than 50% of the year (if she\\'s not a full-time student); and She can\\'t provide more than half of her own financial support. Second, look at her income. Here\\'s where it gets more complicated because there are different rules for earned income from a job, unearned or investment income from dividends, interest or investment gains—or a combination of both. And third, she will need to file her own return if her earned or unearned income exceeds certain thresholds. For earned income only This is pretty straightforward. A dependent who only has earned income only has to file a separate tax return if their earned income is above the standard deduction—$12,550 for 2021. If your daughter earned less than that, she doesn’t have to file. That said, it could be a good idea to do it anyway because if her employer withheld federal income tax, she might be entitled to a refund. You don\\'t want her to miss out on that! For unearned income only Unearned income has different rules. If a dependent has unearned income above $1,100 for 2021, a tax return is required. But when dealing with unearned income only, you may be able to include that income on your own return. One caveat: If you include it on your return, it could boost you into a higher tax bracket—and possibly higher tax rates. For a combination of both The rules change again if a dependent has both earned and unearned income, as is the case for your daughter. In this case, you need to file a separate return if: Her unearned income is more than $1,100. Her earned income is more than $12,550. Her combined income totals more than the larger of $1,100 or earned income (up to $12,200) plus $350. As an example, let\\'s say your daughter had $100 in investment income plus $4,000 in earned income. She wouldn\\'t have to file a return because both her unearned and earned incomes are below the individual thresholds and her combined income of $4,100 is less than her total earned income plus $350 ($4,350). However, if the balance tips to more investment income, and she had even $400 in investment income, she would have to file because her total income of $4,400 would be more than $4,350. Now let\\'s say your daughter had only $400 in earned income but $800 in investment income. In this case, she would also have to file a return because her total income of $1,200 is more than $1,100. All this can be very confusing, so unless your daughter\\'s situation is straightforward, I\\'d talk to your tax professional. Also check out IRS Publication 501 for a thorough treatment and worksheet. W2 versus 1099 income You also should be aware of the different treatment of income reported on Forms W2 and 1099. If your daughter is considered an employee, her income will be reported on a W2 and subject to withholding. However, some employers hire part-time workers as contractors. On the plus side, nothing will be withheld. On the minus side, contractors who have net earnings (income minus expenses) of more than $400 will owe self-employment taxes, which basically cover Social Security and Medicare taxes. In this case, a contractor has to file a tax return even if no income taxes are owed. A word on the \"Kiddie Tax\" You may have heard of the Kiddie Tax, so I think that\\'s also worth a mention. This has to do with tax rates on unearned income. While for 2021, there\\'s no tax on a child\\'s unearned income that is less than $1,100, tax rates on unearned income above that amount vary. Unearned income between $1,100 and $2,200 is taxed at the child\\'s rate. Unearned income above $2,200 is taxed at the parent\\'s highest income tax rate. If your child has a lot of unearned income, that could be pretty significant. (These figures have increased by $100 for 2022.) Going beyond taxes Whether or not your daughter files a return, I\\'d definitely talk to her about taxes and withholding, and have her work with you as you prepare either hers or your own return. Then take it beyond taxes and talk about investing basics as well as responsible money management. As you review your daughter’s stock gains or losses, you can start to talk about the importance of having a diversified portfolio and a long-term perspective. And now that she is earning her own money, help her create a budget so she can make the most of it. For instance, what do you expect her to pay for? Clothes? Entertainment? Gas? Have her keep track of her expenses monthly (an online budget calculator can help). It can also be great to encourage her to save a certain percentage of her paycheck each month for a future goal. If she hasn\\'t done so already, help her open both checking and savings accounts and set up an automatic deposit from one to the other. Now that she has earned income, you might even help her open a Roth IRA (a Roth can be especially powerful for someone like a child who is currently in a low tax bracket but likely to be in a much higher bracket later). Establishing good money habits early is incredibly important. Unfortunately, though, not enough kids learn much about managing money in school, so it\\'s largely up to you. Show her how you manage for both the short- and long-term. If you take it step by step and include her where appropriate in your own money strategies, you\\'ll set her on the path to being able to not only handle her taxes, but her financial future, as well.

       "   'content': 'The past isn\\'t a perfect predictor of market behavior, but it has proven to be a useful guide. A long history of geopolitical conflicts, including those involving Russia, have seen stocks recover and post gains after periods of armed conflict during the past 30 years (1991, 2001, 2003, 2014)—except when an economic recession followed (2008). Europe\\'s stock market performance around periods of armed conflict Source: Charles Schwab, Macrobond, STOXX 600 Index as of 3/13/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Although these conflicts differed, there were similarities in their economic backdrop and all of them involved major energy exporters. For example, ahead of the conflicts in 1991 and 2001 there were recessions, as we recently experienced in 2020. Oil prices doubled in the run up to the conflict in 2003. Economic sanctions on Russia were applied in response to the wars in 2008 and 2014. The Fed gave us the \"taper tantrum\" when it signaled tightening ahead of the conflict in 2014. Recession odds A key question for investors is: Will the current conflict lead into a recession? In our view, the odds are above average, but still below 50%. Outside of Russia, the biggest risk of recession is in Europe. Europe\\'s economy is currently being challenged by higher energy prices and tighter lending conditions in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, due to higher reliance on Russian energy, economic ties, and geographic proximity. Because Europe is a huge customer of products and services produced by companies headquartered in the U.S. and Asia, investors everywhere are focused on this risk of European recession. Should a blanket ban on energy imports from Russia in all major consuming countries, not merely the U.S., come to pass, it would severely reduce and disrupt energy supply on a global scale, making recession more likely. However, that scenario doesn\\'t seem likely in the near term; the German chancellor has currently outright rejected the idea of a ban on Russian energy imports to Europe due to the economic harm it would inflict on its economy. Additionally, there seems to be no indication that Russia intends to cut off energy exports—which make up over a third of their gross domestic product (GDP). Encouragingly, economic data in Europe shows that the economy strengthened in February before the war, rebounding from the omicron-driven slowdown. Moreover, last Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) revised its forecast for Europe’s GDP growth this year down from a very fast 4.2% to a still strong 3.7% due to the war. Their forecast came with two downside scenarios: the \"adverse scenario,\" in which they estimate 2.5% GDP growth; and the \"severe scenario\" estimate, pushing GDP growth down to 2.3%. These scenarios are both still well above the negative rate of change that would define a recession. In the worst-case scenario, the ECB still sees above-average growth for Europe this year, which is notable for a central bank whose policy has anticipated economic weakness for the past decade. ECB: Recession not on the table Source: Charles Schwab, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund data as of 3/10/2022. Real-time indicators Of course, the ECB could be wrong. To track what is happening in Europe’s economy in real time, we have gone back to looking at some of the high-frequency indicators of consumer activity which worked well for us during the pandemic to assess the economic trend. This data has been showing us that consumer activity seems to be holding up, so far. For example: Traffic congestion tracked by TomTom shows no slowdown in driving around Europe\\'s biggest cities, on both weekdays and the weekends, despite higher gas prices. Peak-hour-of-the-day traffic congestion for European capital cities Source: Charles Schwab, TomTom.com traffic data as of 3/13/2022.

European weekend box office results Source: Charles Schwab, BoxOfficeMoJo.com data as of 3/13/2022. Data is dominated in U.S. Dollars. So far, it seems like Europe\\'s economy, which is very much driven by consumer spending, seems to be tracking European Central Bank\\'s estimates of a relatively steady pace of economic activity. Financial crisis Outside of the potential for a sharp slowdown in activity to lead to an economic recession, there are indirect risks to economic growth from a financial shock. Russian stocks and bonds have plunged. The Russian stock market declined more than 50% before being halted for trading after the invasion of Ukraine. Russian government bonds are now priced at around 10 cents on the dollar from above 110 at the start of the year. It\\'s rare to see any economic fallout on the stock side (usually financial institutions don’t tend to have a lot of stock market exposure), making Russia\\'s market decline less impactful outside of Russia. Generally, it is bond market defaults that have more potential to cause trouble for the world’s financial system and economy. Pre-invasion, Russian bonds made up less than 0.3% of the global aggregate bond index, comparable to the exposure of Venezuelan bonds before 2017. Venezuela (another big oil exporter) and its state-owned oil company had started to default on its debt in response to U.S. sanctions in 2017, and completely defaulted on all debt by 2019. Why was there no global financial crisis in response to that default? Because it was isolated to one country and not part of any contagion tied to unsustainable debt and current account balances across emerging-market countries. We believe Russia’s potential bond defaults are also unlikely to cause a financial crisis this time, for similar reasons. Importantly, European banks appear to have low exposure to Russian government bonds. Russia\\'s potential default risk is not isolated to its bond issuance. One additional channel of default risk is through the derivative markets. As an example, if a Russian oil company wanted to hedge against a drop in oil prices, it might have taken out a derivative contract with an exchange a year ago. That contract would now be at a deep loss due to the rally in oil prices. The Russian company may not be able to cover the loss for various reasons and could default. The Russian company\\'s broker in this scenario—perhaps a subsidiary of a major bank—would be required to cover the loss to the exchange (as it would if the contract didn’t go through an exchange but was instead directly with the bank). If these losses are large, or if there are many of them, the bank could find itself in need of capital. This potential scenario playing out across multiple banks could cause a chain reaction to reduce risk, leading to higher margin requirements and margin calls, draining liquidity from the commodity markets, and forcing corporate treasurers to sell other financial assets to meet calls. Investor caution regarding this possible scenario may be part of the reason financials have been the worst-performing sector over the past couple of weeks. Yet, in our analysis, the size of any potential losses from derivative default is unlikely to be substantial relative to the capital the banks now hold. This leads us to conclude that a major financial shock from the plunge in Russian stocks or bonds, or a default in the derivatives market, seems unlikely. Long-term impacts A long history of sanctions shows they don\\'t seem to change behavior or oust leaders (e.g., the many years of tough sanctions on Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela). But, they do impose severe costs leading to longer-term policy shifts, which do tend to restrain regimes, and have a lasting global impact. Europe is considering a joint bond to finance higher energy and defense spending as it seeks to reduce its dependence on Russian energy imports by two-thirds within the next nine months (by next winter\\'s heating season). While the severe costs of the tight commodity markets pose a near-term risk to growth, the massive government spending needed to undertake this dramatic transition in Europe is likely to act as a tailwind to growth over a much longer term than the next few months. Takeaways We believe the odds of a recession in Europe are above average and rising, but still below 50%. We will be watching the developments and high-frequency data closely to see how the economic outlook evolves. Signs of stability could support Europe’s stocks, but a weakening picture could mean more volatility for stocks in Europe and elsewhere. In the current environment, it is hard to have a lot of confidence in how and when the war and related impact is going to resolve, for better or worse, in the near-term or longer-term. So rather than make a bet one way or another, until we know more, it makes the most sense to rebalance back to your long-term strategic asset-allocation targets and let broad diversification help manage the heightened volatility.

       "   'content': 'Selling investments at depressed prices during a market downturn creates a double-edged problem for retirees. First, when prices are low, you may have to have to sell more shares to raise the same amount of cash as you would have before the downturn. And second, tapping your portfolio in a bad market could permanently undermine your ability to participate in any future recoveries. Perhaps the best way to avoid this kind of crunch is to prepare in advance. If you\\'ll need money soon, regardless of market conditions, we recommend holding the equivalent of a least a year\\'s worth of anticipated withdrawals in cash investments—such as checking or savings accounts, money market funds or certificates of deposit (CDs)—with another two to four years’ worth in relatively liquid, conservative investments such as short-term Treasuries and other high-quality bonds or short-term bond funds. A four-year cushion should be enough to help you manage your risk in most bear markets. According to research by the Schwab Center for Financial Research, from the 1960s through 2021, the average peak-to-peak recovery time for a diversified index of stocks in bear markets was about three and a half years.1 However, if you haven\\'t prepared, all is not lost. Consider the following steps to minimize the impact of a down market on your retirement portfolio: Step 1: Know how much you can spend If you haven\\'t done so already, you should figure out how much you can withdraw from your portfolio each year while maintaining a high degree of confidence that your money will last throughout a 30-year retirement. One common rule of thumb is for retirees to withdraw 4% of their portfolios in the first year of retirement and then adjust that amount for inflation every year thereafter. While that\\'s fine as a general rule, you can get a more precise and dynamic calculation by creating a plan with a professional financial planner or using online tools. These can map your withdrawals and spending in various types of markets, using projections to estimate the probability of your savings going the distance. Market changes—both up and down—can affect those probabilities. If the probability of your savings sufficing to cover your retirement expenses is 80% to 90% or more, that’s good. However, if it drops below 75% or thereabouts, we suggest making small, temporary adjustments to keep your plan on track. For example, ask yourself if you can skip an inflation adjustment this year, or make reductions in less essential expenses. If the likelihood is lower than 75%, we suggest considering more sizable adjustments in spending from the portfolio to allow time for a potential rebound in the markets. Step 2: Look for ways to reduce your spending Start by tracking recent spending, and then drawing up a budget. Budgets are never fun. But it\\'s helpful to know what you are spending on what. That will give you a sense of where you could adjust. Not every expense is a necessity, and tracking recent spending helps clarify what is. Group your expenses in terms of needs, wants, and wishes. Your needs are the essentials—think food, housing, health care, insurance, and taxes. Wants are the nice-to-haves like eating out, a gym membership, or travel. Wishes are the things you’d do if you had unlimited time and money. Cutting back on wants and wishes is the place to start. For example, can you limit how often you eat in restaurants, or choose less-expensive ones? Can you postpone buying a new car or taking a trip? Step 3: Look for other cash solutions Do you have an emergency or rainy-day fund? Do you have any cash sitting around in an old, neglected account? This is the time to think about using it. If you\\'re expecting a tax refund, then consider filing right away. If you\\'re expecting a tax bill, start saving for it immediately, rather than letting it sneak up on you come Tax Day. You could also get creative. Do you have things you could consider selling? Also, see if a refund can be issued on any pre-paid annual subscriptions you might have. These are often harder to spot on a monthly budget. Do you own an annuity that you purchased as an investment but haven’t \"turned on\" the income yet? Talk with a financial planner or annuity specialist about whether starting income now would make sense, so you don\\'t have to start drawing from your investment portfolio. In short, every dollar you can access today from other sources is one you don’t have to pull out of your investment portfolio by selling more volatile assets. Step 4: If you must tap your savings, be strategic 1. Start with interest and dividends from your taxable accounts Leaving the original investment untouched means it can potentially continue to grow, and potentially yield more dividends and/or interest in the future. Interest is taxed as ordinary income—unless it\\'s from a tax-free municipal bond or municipal bond fund, in which case interest income is often exempt from federal and, potentially, state income taxes. Dividends, on the other hand, are often taxed at the lower capital gains rate of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on income level—provided certain requirements, such as minimum holding periods, are met. 2. Tap the principal from maturing bonds or CDs The principal from a maturing bond or CD in your taxable account is often the next place to turn. Generally speaking, you won\\'t owe any taxes on your original principal; an early sale may trigger capital gains taxes if you earn a profit on the sale. 3. Consider selling lower-volatility investments Next, consider selling lower-volatility assets, such as short-term bonds or bond funds, that haven\\'t been as buffeted by the recent market volatility. These types of investments can provide liquidity—that is, money when you need it at a relatively stable price. 4. Rebalance your portfolio If asset sales and the recent market turbulence have left your portfolio out of alignment with your long-term allocation, consider looking for opportunities to raise cash by rebalancing. That means selling assets that have risen in value and are now overrepresented in your portfolio relative to your desired allocation, and buying those that have decreased in value. The goal is to return your allocation to its original target. Start by determining how much cash you\\'d like to free up and subtract that from your current portfolio balance. Then use that new balance to determine the dollar values for your allocations to stocks, bonds, and cash investments so that they align with the percentages in your target allocation. That will tell you how much of each asset to buy or sell so that you\\'re freeing up the desired amount of cash while keeping your portfolio on target. 5. Prune unattractive investments If you still need cash, focus on shedding assets whose prospects no longer match your goals. This kind of portfolio maintenance is a good idea in any market, but it can be particularly useful when you\\'re looking for items to sell. A rule of thumb is that if you wouldn\\'t buy more of a particular investment today, then you should consider selling it. 6. Use investment losses to reduce your tax bill Do you have any assets in taxable non-retirement accounts that have fallen in value? You can use those losses to offset gains you may have realized in your taxable accounts over the course of the year, which can help reduce your tax liability—a strategy known as tax-loss harvesting. Even if you have no gains to counteract, you can still use your losses to offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income per tax year until all your losses have been accounted for. 7. Make tax-efficient choices If, after harvesting all your losses, you still need to sell assets from taxable accounts to meet your cash needs, be sure to make tax-efficient choices. For example, consider selling investments you\\'ve held for more than a year. Any gains on stocks, bonds, and mutual funds held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum federal long-term capital gains rate of 20%, whereas investments held for a year or less are taxed at your federal ordinary income tax rate. Some gains may be subject to state and local taxes as well. The bottom line It\\'s impossible to say with certainty what the future holds, but anything you can do to lighten your reliance on large withdrawals from retirement savings during a downturn can help preserve your savings over the longer term. Even small reductions to withdrawals can go a long way toward giving your portfolio time to recover and helping your savings last. 1Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Bloomberg.

       "   'content': 'When you give assets to someone—whether cash, stocks or a car—the government may want to know about it and may even want to collect some taxes. Fortunately, a large portion of your gifts or estate is excluded from taxation, and there are numerous ways to give assets tax free, including these: Using the annual gift tax exclusion Using the lifetime gift and estate tax exemption Making direct payments to medical and educational providers on behalf of a loved one In general, it\\'s better to give assets to your loved ones while you\\'re still alive rather than after you pass away. Giving today allows your loved ones to benefit from your gifts right away and gives you the enjoyment of seeing your gifts improve their lives. In addition, those gifts can grow in value in their hands, rather than yours, which helps reduce your taxable estate. How the gift tax \"exclusion\" works Currently, you can give any number of people up to $16,000 each in a single year without incurring a taxable gift ($32,000 for spouses \"splitting\" gifts)—up from $15,000 for 2021. The recipient typically owes no taxes and doesn’t have to report the gift unless it comes from a foreign source. However, if your gift exceeds $16,000 to any person during the year, you have to report it on a gift tax return (IRS Form 709). Spouses splitting gifts must always file Form 709, even when no taxable gift is incurred. Once you give more than the annual gift tax exclusion, you begin to eat into your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption. How the gift and estate tax \"exemption\" works How the gift and estate tax \"exemption\" works With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the gift and estate tax exemption has increased significantly. The chart below shows the current tax rate and exemption levels for the gift and estate tax: Highest tax rate(for gifts or estates over the exemption amount) Gift and estate exemption (2017 and prior years) Gift and estate exemption (2022, expires in 2025) 40% $5.49 million* $12.06 million* With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the gift and estate tax exemption has increased significantly. The chart below shows the current tax rate and exemption levels for the gift and estate tax: Disclosures *Adjusted annually for inflation The $12.06 million exemption applies to gifts and estate taxes combined—any portion of the exemption you use for gifting will reduce the amount you can use for the estate tax. The IRS refers to this as a \"unified credit.\" Each donor (the person making the gift) has a separate lifetime exemption that can be used before any out-of-pocket gift tax is due. In addition, a couple can combine their exemptions to get a total exemption of $24.12 million. There\\'s one big caveat to be aware of—the $12.06 million exception is temporary and only applies to tax years up to 2025. Unless Congress makes these changes permanent, after 2025 the exemption will revert back to the $5.49 million exemption (adjusted for inflation). So here is the big question—if this new exemption disappears after 2025, how do you take advantage of it before then? How to lock in the new exemption For the majority of people, the gift and estate tax exemption will allow for the tax-free transfer of wealth from one generation to the next. For those who have acquired enough wealth to surpass the gift and estate tax exemption, there are several strategies that could lock in the $12.06 million exemption. The simplest way is to gift your assets to your loved ones now, rather than waiting until you pass away. If you have the means, giving the assets now has two advantages. First, you get to see your loved ones benefit from your gifts. Second, the gifted assets could increase in value for your loved ones—and could decrease your taxable estate. For example, if you were able to give the entire $12.06 million to your children today, that money could grow over time. At a hypothetical investment growth rate of 5% per year for 10 years, that $12.06 million gift could end up being worth over $19.64 million, and your loved ones will have received the entire amount free from gift or estate taxes. On the other hand, if you held onto those assets and you passed away in 10 years, a large portion of the $19.64 million would be taxed at 40%. Additionally, in 10 years the gift and estate tax exemption will have likely reverted back to the lower $5.49 million amount (for dates after 2025). That could result in your estate having to pay over $4.9 million in federal taxes, leaving your heirs with about $14.74 million in after-tax assets rather than $19.64 million if you made the gift sooner.1 Ensuring your gifts are used and managed properly One concern many people have when it comes to giving assets away early is that sometimes the person receiving the gift may not be ready to handle the responsibility of managing such a large amount of money. A good example of this is a large amount of money gifted to a young child or teenager. One way to give those assets, but ensure they are protected from misuse, would be to give them to an irrevocable trust and make the child or teenager the beneficiary. This method allows you to set the rules of the trust and determine how the assets will be invested and distributed. For instance, you could create a trust that stipulates the beneficiary can only have access to the income generated by the assets—or you could set specific rules, such as requiring the beneficiary to graduate from college before having access to the funds in the trust. There are numerous options when it comes to structuring a trust, and each state has its own rules. If you\\'re interested in learning more about the various options available, take the time to meet with an attorney or tax professional in your area. Other ways to give tax-free You can also make unlimited payments directly to medical providers or educational institutions on behalf of others for qualified expenses without incurring a taxable gift or affecting your $16,000 gift exclusion. This method is a great way to help out a loved one with large medical bills from an illness or to help pay for a family member’s education. For example, say you wanted to pay your granddaughter\\'s $50,000 tuition for her medical degree. You could pay the university directly for her tuition and still give her an additional $16,000 tax-free. This strategy reduces your taxable estate and helps preserve your lifetime gift and estate exemption. How to minimize taxes for recipients One thing to remember about the assets you gift is that your cost basis will transfer over to the recipient. So, if that asset has appreciated in value significantly prior to the gift, the recipient could incur a substantial taxable gain when selling that asset. Highly appreciated assets that are received as part of an estate, on the other hand, generally get a \"step up\" in basis (resetting the cost basis at the current market rate), which means a taxable gain could be avoided if the asset is sold soon after being received. In a nutshell, you need to carefully select what assets you gift to minimize the impact of taxes. In general, cash and assets with little appreciation are better for gifts while highly appreciated assets are better to transfer as part of your estate. Finally, a few caveats Lifetime gifting can be a great strategy, as long as you leave yourself enough to live on. For the gift to count, it has to be a complete and irrevocable transfer. This article only focuses on the federal tax implications for gifting and estates. Depending on where you live, there could be state tax consequences for your gifts and estate. Take the time to meet with a tax and estate planning professional to ensure your gift and estate plans are well thought out and properly implemented. As with any tax planning strategy, there is always the possibility that Congress could change the laws related to the gift and estate tax exemption. You\\'ll want to review your gift and estate strategy each year to be sure that your plans are still relevant based on your financial situation or changes in tax laws. 1Calculations assume the prior $5.49 million exception will be adjusted for inflation, estimated to be 3% per year, resulting in an exemption of $7.38 million in 10 years form 2022. The taxable estate would be $12.26 million ($19.64 million minus $7.38 million), resulting in $4.9 million in taxes ($12.26 million times the 40% tax rate).'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Sometimes it takes a stock market drop to get investors thinking about how to better protect their downside. \"An unattended portfolio may have become more aggressive as the stock portion outperformed the other asset classes and ended up accounting for more of the overall portfolio value,\" says Mark Riepe, managing director at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"That\\'s fine as long as stocks keep going up, but conditions can turn around quickly. When they do, you may not be prepared, either financially or emotionally, to tolerate a sharp decline in your portfolio.\" To arm yourself against a potential market downturn, you may want to reexamine your investing strategy through the lens of your current risk appetite and time horizon. Here are some basics to keep in mind about playing defense, along with specific tactics for managing risk during turbulent times. Reassess your risk tolerance Before you make any adjustments to your holdings, make sure your financial plan is up to date: Does your portfolio mix still match your risk tolerance? Does your risk tolerance still match your goals? A spike in volatility can remind investors why it\\'s often wise to take a more conservative stance the closer you get to retirement—by shifting from stocks into bonds and other fixed income investments, for example. Indeed, those in or near retirement may want to keep enough cash on hand to cover a year\\'s worth of spending needs (after accounting for other sources of income, including Social Security), and cash or short-term bonds for an additional one to three years\\' worth of spending needs. This degree of financial flexibility can help investors manage unforeseen expenses without having to liquidate stocks under less-than-ideal conditions. On the flip side, if retirement is at a comfortable distance, you shouldn\\'t be too spooked by swings in the market. You may have sufficient time—so long as you stay invested—to wait out a downturn and capture the longer-term gains that stocks have historically delivered. Rebalance your portfolio Your portfolio should match your appetite for risk. If the recent stock market volatility made you want to jump ship, you may consider revisiting your allocation. Equally important, you want to make sure your intended asset allocation matches your actual one. If it doesn\\'t, consider rebalancing by selling overweight positions and buying underweight ones. When you fail to rebalance as stocks climb, your equity allocation can become an ever-larger part of your portfolio. Remain focused By all means, reassess and rebalance, but don\\'t forget to stay focused while doing so. Trying to dump investments when both the market and your confidence are dropping disregards the adage \"buy low, sell high.\" If the head-for-the-exits feeling is familiar, you may be the kind of investor who would benefit from a more conservative portfolio—as part of your long-term strategy, not as a response to a market upset. At the end of the day, though, staying invested to support your goals can help you avoid making decisions in the heat of the moment. Our research shows that even bad market timing beats perpetually sitting on the sidelines. Get in, stay in Here\\'s where five hypothetical investors who invested $2,000 a year would have ended up after 20 years. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Invested $2,000 annually in a hypothetical portfolio that tracks the S&P 500® Index from 2001-2020.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. The examples are hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. They are not intended to represent a specific investment product, and investors may not achieve similar results. Dividends and interest are assumed to have been reinvested, and the examples do not reflect the effects of taxes, expenses, or fees. Had fees, expenses, or taxes been considered, returns would have been substantially lower. Moves you can make If, after reassessing your plan and rebalancing your portfolio, you want to take an even more defensive stance, there are other minor adjustments you might make. Specifically, you could bump up your holdings of less-risky asset classes and trim your long-term allocation to riskier ones. For example: Consider more: Cash and cash investments: Generally speaking, your upside with cash is limited, but it retains its value (before inflation) in the face of even the steepest market declines. And cash tends not to move in lockstep with changes in the prices of other kinds of assets. \"Cash is the ultimate defensive asset, and cash investments can benefit from rising interest rates when the Fed is in a hiking cycle,\" Mark says. \"Plus, it\\'s great way to hold an emergency fund.\" Gold: The precious metal has a history of holding its value—and even rising—when other asset classes are under pressure. In fact, it was one of the few investments with positive returns during the worst days of the 2008–2009 financial crisis. Keep in mind, however, that while gold and other precious metals can shine when market conditions are uncertain, their prices can be volatile. Treasuries: Backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, these are the safest fixed income investments you can own. Short-term Treasuries (which mature in a year or less) can provide income with low risk, especially as the Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates more than once in the coming months. Treasuries that mature in the intermediate term (i.e., less than 10 years) and longer term may offer even more income, though their prices could suffer as interest rates move higher. Consider less: High-yield debt: The value of outstanding debt owed by sub-investment grade businesses has more than doubled since 2008 to a record $3 trillion1 as companies capitalized on historically low interest rates, raising concerns of a potential bubble. Emerging-market stocks: Slowing growth in developing countries has helped stoke some of the recent market turmoil. For example, China—the mother of all emerging markets—has faced slowing growth rates even as its hardline approach to COVID shutdowns, regulatory crackdowns, and corporate debt crises have led to volatility in the markets. Small-cap stocks: Publicly traded companies with a market capitalization ranging from roughly $300 million to $2 billion tend to be more volatile than their large-cap counterparts, particularly during a downturn. De-risking the right way There are a lot of ways to dial back the risk in your portfolio. The idea is to embrace these options in appropriate amounts. For example, taking a more aggressive tactical approach might be right for investors with the inclination, time, and skills to watch the market closely. But if—like most investors—you\\'re focused on the long term, one of the best ways to play defense is to maintain an asset allocation that matches your time horizon and risk tolerance. If you do decide to add or trim exposure to certain asset classes, make sure you\\'re doing so in response to your needs and goals—not because of short-term market gyrations. The goal is to follow a strategy you can live with through the ups and downs. 1S&P Global Market Intelligence, as of June 30, 2021.

Historical impact of a rising federal funds rate Here are some common bank and investment holdings to watch as short-term rates trend upward. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Savings: Bank savings rates generally have risen gradually, benefiting investors with savings accounts. Short-term certificates of deposit (CDs): CD rates often rise but not necessarily by the same amount across all CDs. Short-term CD rates tend to be the most sensitive to Fed rate hikes. Cash investments: Yields on cash investments typically rise, but the impact on various cash-related investments can vary. Short-term bonds: Initially, short-term bond prices may drop, but price declines tend to be nominal. However, as existing bonds mature, moving money into new, higher-yielding securities generally boosts income over time. Financial stocks: Higher interest rates widen the gap between what banks pay on deposits and charge on loans, which can improve bank stocks. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Mortgage rates: Fixed mortgage rates generally track 10-year Treasury yields, so a higher federal funds rate won't necessarily drive mortgage rates higher. Asset-based loans: Rates on loans, such as pledged asset lines and margin loans, may gradually rise, but asset-based loans still can be a low-cost borrowing choice for investors who can mitigate the risk. Stock market: How rising interest rates impact the stock market depends on many factors, such as the pace of the rate hikes and inflation. Dating back to 1946, stocks were (on average) down nearly 3% in the first year of fast rate-hiking cycles and up more than 10% in the first year of slow rate-hiking cycles. Also, while rate hikes are intended to curb inflation, U.S. stocks have historically underperformed international stocks (with turning points lagging by about two years) when long-term inflation expectations are rising, suggesting the relative performance of international stocks may be favorable due to their greater inflation sensitivity. Intermediate- and long-term bonds: Performance has been mixed for intermediate- and long-term bonds during previous periods of Fed rate hikes. As interest rates increase, these bond yields may rise, pulling their prices lower. However, their yields tend to be more affected by growth and inflation expectations than by the federal funds rate as time goes on. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Home equity loans: Rates on home equity loans usually track short-term interest rates and may move gradually higher. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs): Short-term rates can also determine ARM rates, so they can be expected to rise as well. Auto loans: Often tied to short-term rates, auto loan rates may rise. However, rates can vary depending on sales incentives and other factors. Utilities stocks: Utilities stocks tend to underperform as investors shift to higher-yielding fixed-income investments. Reacting to rising rates While history can be a guide for how investments may perform when short-term rates rise, there are no hard-and-fast rules when it comes to investing. Establishing a financial plan and building a diversified portfolio based on your goals and risk tolerance can help you weather changing market conditions.\"},\n",

       "   'content': \"Some taxpayers' refunds may look a little different this year due to federal relief efforts included in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. We'll address some of those changes here and explain how they could affect your filing. Tax refunds (or bills) depend on your withholding Uncle Sam withholds a portion of every paycheck to cover your tax obligation for the year. In a perfect world, you'd know exactly what that obligation was and could withhold accordingly. As a result, you'd never be owed a refund or receive a surprise bill after preparing your tax return. In the real world, however, calculating your tax obligation in advance is difficult because your income might change or you may want to claim certain deductions. That's why most people either receive a refund or have to pay a bit extra when they file. Neither is a judgment about your finances. A refund just means you withheld too much from your paycheck, while an addition tax liability means you didn't withhold enough. What's in a refund? As exciting as refunds are, they're really just the federal government returning the extra amount you paid. While some people prefer to receive a large refund at tax time, there may be better ways to save money. In fact, when you withhold too much, you're effectively giving the government an interest-free loan: The government gets to use your money, and then returns it to you without any compensation—not a great investment. We generally recommend doing a bit of advance tax planning and then finetuning your withholding so you're paying just enough to cover your tax bill. (If you don't withhold enough, you may face penalties.) The upshot would be having more money that you could invest for a return or spend as needed, without having to wait for a refund the following spring. What's your actual tax liability? The following information from the Form 1040, which you use to file your taxes each year, will help you determine your tax liability—and whether you'll get a refund or end up owing more: Line 24: The total tax due is what you owe in taxes for the year Line 25d: Income tax withheld is the total amount withheld from your income Is the number on Line 25d larger than the number on Line 24? If so, that means you withheld too much. Go to: Line 34: This is your refund Or is Line 24 larger? If so, you didn't withhold enough. Go to: Line 37: This is the amount you owe Image of Form 1040 for 2021 Source: IRS Form 1040 for 2021. Why did my refund (or tax due) change so much this year? If any of the numbers above differ significantly from what you’ve come to expect from previous years' filings, there may be good reasons. As mentioned above, the American Rescue Plan Act introduced a few potential wrinkles. In 2021, Congress increased the child tax credit to $3,600 for each child under age 6 and $3,000 per qualifying child between the ages of 6 to 17 years old, from $2,000 the year before. In addition, Congress authorized advance monthly payments for up to 50% of the credit from July through December last year. Eligibility for these payments was based on taxpayers' 2020 or 2019 filings and started to phase out at incomes above $150,000 for married couples filing jointly (or $75,000 for single filers). This change could affect your filing in a few ways. For example, if you’re accustomed to claiming the full child tax credit when you file but received advance payments in 2021, it’s possible your refund will be smaller than in previous years (or the amount you owe higher) simply because you received part of the credit in advance, despite Congress having raised the size of the credit. Also, if you received advance payments, the IRS would have recorded the amount in Letter 6419, which you should have received in January. You will need this information when you file your taxes. If you're eligible for the full child tax credit, you will receive the remaining amount when you file your return. If you were eligible for the increased child tax credit based on your prior tax return but didn’t get the advance payments, you can claim the full amount when you file your taxes. However, if your income in 2021 was significantly higher than in your prior tax return, it's possible you might have received advance payments for which you were no longer eligible. Depending on your income, you could end up having to repay some or all the advance credit you received. How to prepare for next year If you want a larger refund next year (again, not recommended, in our opinion), you can update your Form W-4 to change how much is withheld from your paychecks. We recommend checking how much is being withheld from your paycheck once or twice a year to make sure you’re on target. For help determining the amount that should be withheld, use the IRS's calculator or meet with a tax professional.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Schwab experts explain how to tune out market noise and make more deliberate investment decisions.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Despite every intention of making rational, reasoned decisions—especially when it comes to our finances—we sometimes allow emotions to get the better of us. Worse, we have a tendency to rationalize away any resulting missteps, which over time only compounds the initial error. Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman has done extensive research into how we can make more deliberate and logical decisions when our emotions are running high. His conclusion? Slow down. The more time you take, Kahneman\\'s research suggests, the less likely your emotions will cloud your decision-making. In practical terms, that means taking a beat and really thinking through why you want to buy an investment. Does the asset support your goals, or are you merely chasing a hot stock or market? The same holds true when you want to sell. Does the investment no longer fit your strategy—or is fear driving your decision? Here\\'s how to know whether you\\'re selling or buying stocks, bonds, and funds for the right reasons. Stocks \"If you\\'re willing to buy or sell at any price, that\\'s a tipoff you\\'re not thinking rationally,\" says Steve Greiner, managing director of Schwab Equity Ratings®. To add more discipline to your investment decisions, study a stock\\'s fundamentals—including the price-to-earnings ratio, dividends and buybacks, and return on capital—and consider them in context. When adding new positions to your portfolio: Favor stocks of companies with high levels of cash and low levels of debt, both of which suggest good financial health. Be wary of stocks of companies whose earnings growth seems excessively high, because they\\'re likely unsustainable. Conversely, you should also be skeptical if a company has no earnings at all, especially if it\\'s in an industry that investors are piling into. \"Those businesses are often living on borrowed capital,\" Steve says. When reviewing the stocks you already own: Watch for deteriorating fundamentals, which often indicate trouble. \"You should ditch a stock as soon as it fails to live up to your reasons for buying it in the first place,\" Steve says. However, if the stock\\'s price is falling, but its fundamentals remain strong, it could be well-positioned for a rebound. \"Don\\'t let fear trick you into parting ways with a worthy investment,\" he adds. Beyond fundamentals, it\\'s also a good idea to pay attention to investor sentiment about a particular stock. \"Following the herd isn\\'t a sound investment strategy, but that doesn\\'t mean you should ignore sentiment entirely,\" Steve says. \"If investors are starting to sour on a stock, you should question why, since sentiment is often a leading indicator of price decline.\" Bonds Because bonds are relatively stable, investors are less likely to dump them in a fit of panic selling. On the contrary, bond investors should be wary of panic buying. Consider reevaluating your next bond purchase if: The purchase would upend your target asset mix. Having some exposure to Treasuries makes sense for many investors because bonds are a vital part of a well-balanced portfolio. But think carefully about the appropriate allocation. Don\\'t rush into Treasuries in response to a weakened economy. Remember, time in the market generally beats trying to time the market. During a market downturn, investing heavily in bonds might offer more portfolio stability, but it could throw your long-term financial goals off track. You\\'re buying risky bonds in an effort to boost yields. With 10-year US Treasury notes yielding close to 1.9%,1 you may be tempted to explore higher-yielding alternatives. Yields in the riskiest part of the bond market have risen from the 2021 lows, with high-yield bonds offering yields of roughly 5.5%—below the 10-year average of 6.1%. High-yield bonds come with greater risks, and letting your desire for higher yields dictate your investment strategy is exactly the type of emotional decision-making you want to avoid. \"High-yield bonds have a much higher default risk than their investment-grade counterparts. While yields have risen from their recent lows, we expect volatility to remain elevated. Investors can consider high-yield bonds in moderation, but we wouldn’t suggest a large allocation advises Collin Martin, director and fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. That said, if you can tolerate a bit more risk while still adhering to your long-term strategy, investing in high-yield bonds through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or a mutual fund can help mitigate default risk. \"Diversification is paramount when investing in high-yield bonds,\" Collin says. \"If you\\'re holding just a handful of individual issues, even one default can have an outsize effect on your overall portfolio.\" So, when should you consider selling a bond? One good reason would be if an issuer\\'s credit quality has deteriorated to the point where you just aren\\'t comfortable with the additional risk. Another would be if you simply need the cash. In either case, don\\'t let a sale throw off your target allocation to bonds—you should still aim to keep your portfolio balanced and in line with your goals. Funds It can be tempting to get into or out of ETFs and mutual funds whenever a big market swing occurs. Unless you\\'re an active trader, however, you should avoid basing your investment decisions on market trends. Most investors know that trying to time the market is contrary to achieving their long-term goals, but knowing that to be true doesn\\'t necessarily keep you from making emotional decisions when markets are surging or slumping. To help keep a level head, predicate your buy and sell decisions on quantifiable factors, such as: Fees. When adding funds to your portfolio, generally favor those with lower operating expense ratios—every dollar you pay in fees is one you can\\'t invest for future growth. That\\'s an easy rule to follow with index funds, whose fees tend to be relatively low, but it\\'s not so cut-and-dried where actively managed funds are concerned. \"Paying a higher fee for an actively managed fund could make sense if you believe the fund will deliver superior returns,\" says Michael Iachini, managing director and head of manager research at Charles Schwab Investment Advisory. \"But don\\'t base such decisions on past performance, because strong returns could be due to luck and might not persist.\" The same holds true for those you already own. \"If any of your current funds seem overly expensive vis-à-vis comparable alternatives, it might be time to make a switch,\" he says. Investment strategy. Whether you\\'re looking for broad exposure to the market or access to a specific sliver, always confirm that a fund\\'s investment strategy is in line with your expectations. Two funds that seem similar on the surface could take very different approaches with their investments. Likewise, it\\'s a good idea to check in on your current funds\\' strategies periodically—especially your active funds. \"Managers may adjust their strategies from time to time in an effort to boost returns or respond to the current environment,\" Michael says. \"If this happens with any of your holdings, make sure you\\'re comfortable with the direction in which the fund is heading.\" Cool it When your emotions are running hot, they can steer you in the wrong direction; slowing down and focusing on the facts can help you make the right decisions at the right time and for the right reasons. That may sound obvious, but it\\'s harder than you might think—especially in the heat of the moment. 1As of 02/09/2022.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"An extreme downturn in the market can shake your confidence, but keeping your mind set on your long-term goals can help you weather the storm. Consider how these three investors—the Stalwart, the Reactor, and the Waffler—behaved during different market conditions over the course of 40 years Wealth accumulated, 1982–2021 This chart illustrates the growth in value the Stalwart, the Reactor, and the Waffler achieved after saving 10% of their annual salary invested in increasingly conservative asset allocations as they aged over four decades. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Morningstar, Inc. The examples are hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. The asset allocation plan performance is the weighted averages of the performances of the indexes used to represent each asset class in the plans, and the plans are rebalanced annually. Fees and expenses would lower returns. Using the same methodology, had a saver stayed invested over four decades in a fund that tracks the S&P 500® index instead of the Schwab models, he or she would have experienced greater volatility and would have had an ending wealth of $2.05 million. In this scenario, the Stalwart, the Reactor, and the Waffler each began at age 26 with a salary of $18,580 in 1982 that grew to $112,560 in 2021 based on a 3% annual increase and a 10% promotion every five years. All three savers started investing with the Schwab Aggressive Model Plan (50% large-cap stocks, 25% international stocks, 20% small-cap stocks, 5% cash). Over the course of four decades, the person who reacted the least gained the most. The Stalwart This disciplined investor sat tight and continued to invest, no matter how the market performed. She shifted to the Moderately Aggressive Model (45% large-cap stocks, 20% international stocks, 15% small-cap stocks, 15% bonds, 5% cash) at age 39 and then moved to the Moderate Model (35% large-cap stocks, 15% international stocks, 10% small-cap stocks, 35% bonds, 5% cash) at age 52. As she neared retirement, her investment portfolio had grown to more than $1.1 million. The Waffler The Waffler followed the same allocation plan as the Stalwart, but he would move all his money out of the market after every year with negative returns. Meanwhile, he continued to save 10% of his salary.* If the market was up after two years, he reinvested his money in a portfolio suitable for his age. With an ending balance of $613,704, the Waffler's strategy cut his potential growth by almost 41%. The Reactor This investor stuck it out through several bear markets, but he pulled his money out of the market during the Great Recession in 2008—and kept it out. He continued to save 10% of his salary with hopes of recouping some of his losses but never reinvested it.* At the end of 40 years, he only managed to save $416,692. Bottom line Each investor had an identical starting allocation and saved the same amount annually. They all diversified, and their portfolios grew less risky as they aged. So, what made the difference in their ending wealth? The way they behaved during bear markets. Reacting to market changes is normal, but try not to let your emotions take over. Instead, review your plan and make adjustments if necessary to stay on track of your goals. *The investor earned the 3-month Treasury bill rate of return during the time out of the market.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'In much the same way as a bank can lend you money if you have equity in your house, your brokerage firm can lend you money against the value of the investments in your portfolio.',\n",
       "   'content': 'In much the same way that a bank can lend you money if you have equity in your house, your brokerage firm can lend you money against the value of certain stocks, bonds, and mutual funds in your portfolio. Such funds are called a margin loan, and you can use them to buy additional securities or even for short-term needs not related to investing. Each brokerage firm can define, within certain guidelines, which stocks, bonds, and mutual funds are marginable. The list usually includes securities traded on the major U.S. stock exchanges that sell for at least $5 per share, though certain high-risk securities may be excluded. Investments in retirement accounts or custodial accounts aren’t eligible. How does margin work? Brokerage customers who sign a margin agreement can generally borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of new marginable investments (the exact amount varies depending on the investment). As we\\'ll see below, that means an investor who uses margin could theoretically buy double the amount of stocks than if they\\'d used cash only. Few investors are that extreme—the more you borrow, the more risk you take on—but 50% makes for simple examples. For example, if you have $5,000 cash in a margin-approved brokerage account, you could buy up to $10,000 worth of marginable stock: You would use your cash to buy the first $5,000 worth, and your brokerage firm would lend you another $5,000 for the rest, with the marginable stock you purchased serving as collateral. The total amount you can deploy using margin is known as your buying power, which in this case amounts to $10,000. (Schwab clients may check their buying power by clicking on the \"Buying Power\" link at the top of the Trade page on Schwab.com). Source: Schwab.com. New securities aren\\'t the only source of collateral. You can also often borrow against the marginable stocks, bonds, and mutual funds already in your account. For example, if you have $5,000 worth of marginable stocks in your account and you haven\\'t yet borrowed against them, you can purchase another $5,000. The stock you already own provides the collateral for the first $2,500, and the newly purchased marginable stock provides the collateral for the second $2,500. You now have $10,000 worth of stock in your account at a 50% loan value, with no additional cash outlay. Because margin uses the value of your marginable securities as collateral, the amount you can borrow fluctuates day to day as the value of the marginable securities in your portfolio rises and falls. If the value of your portfolio rises, your buying power increases. If it falls, your buying power decreases. Margin interest As with any loan, when you buy securities on margin you have to pay back the money you borrow plus interest, which varies by brokerage firm and the amount of the loan. Margin interest rates are typically lower than those on credit cards and unsecured personal loans. There\\'s no set repayment schedule with a margin loan—monthly interest charges accrue to your account, and you can repay the principal at your convenience. Also, margin interest may be tax deductible if you use the margin to purchase taxable investments and you itemize your deductions (subject to certain limitations; consult a tax professional about your individual situation). The benefits of margin When used for investing, margin can magnify your profits—and your losses. Here\\'s an example of the potential upside. (For simplicity, we\\'ll ignore trading fees and taxes.) Assume you spend $5,000 cash to buy 100 shares of a $50 stock. A year passes, and that stock rises to $70. Your shares are now worth $7,000. You sell and realize a profit of $2,000. A gain without margin You pay cash for 100 shares of a $50 stock: -$5,000 Stock rises to $70 and you sell 100 shares: $7,000 Your gain: $2,000 You pay cash for 100 shares of a $50 stock: -$5,000 Stock rises to $70 and you sell 100 shares: $7,000 Your gain: $2,000 You pay cash for 100 shares of a $50 stock: -$5,000 Stock rises to $70 and you sell 100 shares: $7,000 Your gain: $2,000 Here\\'s what happens when you add margin into the mix. As we saw above, $5,000 in cash gives you buying power totaling $10,000—your existing cash, plus another $5,000 borrowed on margin from your brokerage firm—allowing you to buy 200 shares of that $50 stock. A year later, when the stock hits $70, your shares are worth $14,000. You sell and pay back $5,000, plus $400 of interest,1 which leaves you with $8,600. Of that, $3,600 is profit. A gain with margin You pay cash for 100 shares of a $50 stock: -$5,000 You buy another 100 shares on margin: $0 Stock rises to $70 and you sell 200 shares: $14,000 Repay margin loan: -$5,000 Pay margin interest: -$400 Your gain: $3,600 You pay cash for 100 shares of a $50 stock: -$5,000 You buy another 100 shares on margin: $0 Stock rises to $70 and you sell 200 shares: $14,000 Repay margin loan: -$5,000 Pay margin interest: -$400 Your gain: $3,600 You pay cash for 100 shares of a $50 stock: -$5,000 You buy another 100 shares on margin: $0 Stock rises to $70 and you sell 200 shares: $14,000 Repay margin loan: -$5,000 Pay margin interest: -$400 Your gain: $3,600 So, in the first case you profited $2,000 on an investment of $5,000 for a gain of 40%. In the second case, using margin, you profited $3,600 on that same $5,000 for a gain of 72%. The risks of margin Margin can magnify profits when your stocks are going up. However, the magnifying effect works the other way as well. Imagine again that you used $5,000 cash to buy 100 shares of a $50 stock, but this time imagine that it sinks to $30 over the ensuing year. Your shares are now worth $3,000. If you sell, you\\'ve lost $2,000. A loss without margin You pay cash for 100 shares of a $50 stock: -$5,000 Stock falls to $30 and you sell 100 shares: $3,000 Your loss: -$2,000 You pay cash for 100 shares of a $50 stock: -$5,000 Stock falls to $30 and you sell 100 shares: $3,000 Your loss: -$2,000 You pay cash for 100 shares of a $50 stock: -$5,000 Stock falls to $30 and you sell 100 shares: $3,000 Your loss: -$2,000 But what if you had borrowed an additional $5,000 on margin and purchased 200 shares of that $50 stock for $10,000? A year later when it hit $30, your shares would be worth $6,000. If you sold for $6,000, you\\'d still have to pay back the $5,000 loan and $400 interest, leaving you with only $600 of your original $5,000—a total loss of $4,400. A loss with margin You pay cash for 100 shares of a $50 stock: -$5,000 You buy another 100 shares on margin: $0 Stock falls to $30 and you sell 200 shares: $6,000 Repay margin loan: -$5,000 Pay margin interest: -$400 Your loss: -$4,400 You pay cash for 100 shares of a $50 stock: -$5,000 You buy another 100 shares on margin: $0 Stock falls to $30 and you sell 200 shares: $6,000 Repay margin loan: -$5,000 Pay margin interest: -$400 Your loss: -$4,400 You pay cash for 100 shares of a $50 stock: -$5,000 You buy another 100 shares on margin: $0 Stock falls to $30 and you sell 200 shares: $6,000 Repay margin loan: -$5,000 Pay margin interest: -$400 Your loss: -$4,400 If the stock had fallen even further, you could theoretically lose all of your initial investment and still have to repay the amount you borrowed, plus interest. Margin call While the value of the stocks used as collateral for the margin loan fluctuates with the market, the amount you borrowed stays the same. As a result, if the stocks fall, your equity in the position relative to the size of your margin debt will shrink. This is important to understand, because brokerage firms require that margin traders maintain a certain percentage of equity in the account as collateral against the purchased securities—typically 30% to 35%, depending on the securities and the brokerage firm.2 If your equity falls below the minimum because of market fluctuations, your brokerage firm will issue a margin call (also known as a maintenance call), and you will be required to immediately deposit more cash or marginable securities in your account to bring your equity back up to the required level. So, assume you own $5,000 in stock and buy an additional $5,000 on margin. Your equity in the position is $5,000 ($10,000 less $5,000 in margin debt), giving you an equity ratio of 50%. If the value of your stock falls to $6,000, your equity would drop to $1,000 ($6,000 in stock less $5,000 margin debt) for an equity ratio of less than 17%. If your brokerage firm’s maintenance requirement is 30%, then the account’s minimum equity would be $1,800 (30% of $6,000 = $1,800). Accordingly, you would be required to deposit: $800 in cash ($1,000+$800=$1,800), or $1,143 of fully paid marginable securities (the $800 shortfall divided by [1 –the .30 equity requirement] = $1143), or Or some combination of the two. Important details about margin loans Margin loans increase your level of market risk. Your downside is not limited to the collateral value in your margin account. Your brokerage firm may initiate the sale of any securities in your account without contacting you, to meet a margin call. Your brokerage firm may increase its \"house\" maintenance margin requirements or remove specific securities from the marginable list at any time and is not required to provide you with advance written notice. You are not entitled to an extension of time to meet a margin call. Triggering a margin call What happens if you don’t meet a margin call? Your brokerage firm may close out positions in your portfolio and isn\\'t required to consult you first. In fact, in a worst-case scenario it\\'s possible your brokerage firm would sell all of your shares, leaving you with no shares, yet still owing money. Again, these examples are based on 50% margin debt, which some investors might consider extreme. If your debt is lower, you also decrease your risk of receiving a margin call. A well-diversified portfolio may also help make margin calls less likely, as you would avoid the risk of having a single position drag down your portfolio. If you decide to use margin, here are some additional ideas to help you manage your account: Pay margin loan interest regularly. Carefully monitor your investments, equity, and margin loan. Set up your own \"trigger point\" somewhere above the official margin maintenance requirement, beyond which you will either deposit funds or securities to increase your equity. Be prepared for the possibility of a margin call—have other financial resources in place or predetermine which portion of your portfolio you would sell. NEVER ignore a margin call. The bottom line Buying stock on margin is only profitable if your stocks go up enough to pay back the loan with interest. But you could lose your principal and then some if your stocks go down too much. However, used wisely and prudently, a margin loan can be a valuable tool in the right circumstances. If you decide margin is right for your investing strategy, consider starting slow and learning by experience.

       "   'abstract': 'IRAs can help you build wealth for retirement and potentially get tax breaks, either up front or in the future.',\n",
       "   'content': 'When it comes to retirement, you need to sock enough money away for a comfortable future. But there\\'s also the here and now to consider. IRAs are savings vehicles that can help you build wealth for retirement and potentially get tax breaks, either up front or in the future. There are two main types of IRAs to consider. Traditional IRA: Can allow you to make pre-tax contributions and defer the taxes you owe until you withdraw the money after age 59½. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.1 Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so you pay taxes up front. But your money grows tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free after age 59½, if you\\'ve had the account for at least five years.2 Whether either IRA is right for you, or both, depends on your specific situation and goals. Here are five common scenarios in which an IRA could benefit you. 1. Your employer doesn\\'t offer a 401(k), or you\\'re self-employed Employer-sponsored 401(k) plans are called the backbone of retirement savings for two reasons: Most employers offer some form of match on employee 401(k) contributions–that\\'s free money you shouldn\\'t pass up. 401(k)s have generous contribution limits that usually come out of your paycheck on a pre-tax basis ($20,500 for tax-year 2022, plus a $6,500 catch-up if you\\'re 50 or older). But what if you don\\'t have access to a 401(k) through your employer? In that case, your next best option is likely a tax-advantaged IRA. In 2022, you can contribute up to $6,000 to a traditional IRA (plus a $1,000 catch-up, if you\\'re 50 or over). If you\\'re self-employed, you can also consider another type of IRA, called a Simplified Employee Pension or SEP IRA. These plans allow small business owners to set aside much more for retirement than a regular traditional IRA will allow. \"Whether you\\'re saving in a regular traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, or a SEP IRA, the tax savings can put you miles ahead of where you would be if you only put money in a taxable account,\" says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP® and director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. 2. You maxed out your 401(k) Even if you have a 401(k), an IRA might still make sense if you want to set aside more than your 401(k) allows. In that case, a traditional or Roth IRA could help you save even more. With an IRA, you may also have access to a wider range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, certificates of deposit (CD), and more. By comparison, most 401(k)s generally include only a limited set of investment funds. 3. You could use a tax break this year Contributing to a traditional IRA is one of only a few tax-smart moves you can make right up until Tax Day. As long as you open and fund your account before the IRS filing deadline, your tax-deferred contributions can usually be subtracted from your taxable income. And that might be enough to drop you into a lower tax bracket, reducing what you owe at tax time. However, there are some rules to be aware of when it comes to determining if your contributions will be tax deductible based on your income level and if you or your spouse is covered by an employer plan.3 4. Your priority is tax-free growth On the other hand, if you don\\'t need the tax break now, you might prefer to contribute to a Roth IRA to take advantage of tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals. Your contributions will be made with after-tax dollars, so they won\\'t reduce your taxable income now. But your money can grow tax-free, which can provide tax savings when you start making withdrawals in retirement. In addition, if you pass your Roth IRA onto your heirs, their withdrawals will also be income-tax free, making them a tax-efficient way to transfer wealth from one generation to the next. There are income limitations when it comes to contributing to a Roth IRA, so be sure you check those limits before putting money into a Roth account.4 5. You want financial flexibility in retirement Because they\\'re each taxed differently, traditional and Roth IRAs can be used not only to cut your tax bills in the short-term and invest tax-efficiently over the long-term, but also to give you added tax flexibility when it\\'s time to withdraw your money. This is often called tax diversification. For example, you could save for retirement in a traditional IRA (pre-tax) and a Roth IRA (after-tax). When it\\'s time to take your money out, you\\'ll have the flexibility to tap the account that makes the most sense for you. And this may help you manage your taxable income5 and how much tax you owe in retirement. 1 Traditional IRA withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax and prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty. 2 If you take a distribution of Roth IRA earnings before you reach age 59½ and before the account is five years old, the earnings may be subject to taxes and a 10% federal tax penalty. 3 To learn more about the limits on tax deductible traditional IRA contributions check out the IRS website at https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-deduction-limits. 4 To learn more about the limits on Roth IRA contributions check out the IRS website at https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2022. 5 Retirees are required to take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred retirement accounts starting at age 72. Those who are subject to RMDs should first take those distributions, then decide which account they should take additional distributions from.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'How much can you spend in retirement without running out of money? The 4% rule is a common rule of thumb, but we think you can do better by finding your personalized spending rate.',\n",
       "   'content': 'You\\'ve worked hard to save for retirement, and now you\\'re ready to turn your savings into a paycheck. But how much can you afford to withdraw from savings and spend? If you spend too much, you risk being left with a shortfall later in retirement. But if you spend too little, you may not enjoy the retirement you envisioned. One frequently used rule of thumb for retirement spending is known as the 4% rule. It\\'s relatively simple: You add up all of your investments, and withdraw 4% of that total during your first year of retirement. In subsequent years, you adjust the dollar amount you withdraw to account for inflation. By following this formula, you should have a very high probability of not outliving your money during a 30-year retirement, according to the rule. For example, let\\'s say your portfolio at retirement totals let\\'s say your portfolio at retirement totals $1 million. You would withdraw $40,000 in your first year of retirement. If the cost of living rises 2% that year, you would give yourself a 2% raise the following year, withdrawing $40,800, and so on for the next 30 years. The 4% rule assumes you withdraw the same amount from your portfolio every year, adjusted for inflation Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Assumes an initial portfolio value of $1 million. Withdrawals increase annually by 2%. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. While the 4% rule is a reasonable place to start, it doesn\\'t fit every investor\\'s situation. A few caveats: It\\'s a rigid rule. The 4% rule assumes you increase your spending every year by the rate of inflation—not on how your portfolio performed—which can be a challenge for some investors. It also assumes you never have years where you spend more, or less, than the inflation increase. This isn\\'t how most people spend in retirement. Expenses may change from one year to the next, and the amount you spend may change throughout retirement. It applies to a specific portfolio composition. The rule applies to a hypothetical portfolio invested 50% in stocks and 50% in bonds. Your actual portfolio composition may differ, and you may change your investments over time during your retirement. We generally suggest that you diversify your portfolio across a wide range of asset classes and types of stocks and bonds, and that you reduce your exposure to stocks as you transition through retirement. It uses historical market returns. Analysis by Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, Inc. (CSIA) projects that market returns for stocks and bonds over the next decade are likely to be below historical averages. Using historical market returns to calculate a sustainable withdrawal rate could result in a withdrawal rate that is too high. It assumes a 30-year time horizon. Depending on your age, 30 years may not be needed or likely. According to Social Security Administration (SSA) estimates, the average remaining life expectancy of people turning 65 today is less than 30 years. We believe that retirees should plan for a long retirement. The risk of running out of money is an important risk to manage. But, if you\\'re already retired or older than 65, your planning time horizon may be different. The 4% rule, in other words, may not suit your situation. It includes a very high level of confidence that your portfolio will last for a 30-year period. The rule uses a very high likelihood (close to 100%, in historical scenarios) that the portfolio would have lasted for a 30-year time period. In other words, it assumes that in nearly every scenario the hypothetical portfolio would not have ended with a negative balance. This may sound great in theory, but it means that you have to spend less in retirement to achieve that level of safety. By staying flexible and revisiting your spending rate annually, you may not need to target such a high confidence level. It doesn\\'t include taxes or investment fees. The rule guides how much to withdraw from your portfolio each year and assumes that taxes or fees, if any, are an expense that you pay out of the money withdrawn. If you withdraw $40,000, and have $5,000 in taxes and fees at year-end, that\\'s paid from the $40,000 withdrawn. Beyond the 4% rule However you slice it, the biggest mistake you can make with the 4% rule is thinking you have to follow it to the letter. It can be used as a starting point—and a basic guideline to help you save for retirement. If you want $40,000 from your portfolio in the first year of a 30-year retirement, increasing annually with inflation, with high confidence your savings will last, using the 4% rule would require you to have $1 million dollars in retirement. But after that, we suggest adopting a personalized spending rate, based on your situation, investments, and risk tolerance, and then regularly updating it. Further, our research suggests that, on average, spending decreases in retirement. It doesn\\'t stay constant (adjusted for inflation) as suggested by the 4% rule. How do you determine your personalized spending rate? Start by asking yourself these questions: 1. How long do you want to plan for? Obviously you don\\'t know exactly how long you\\'ll live, and it\\'s not a question that many people want to ponder too deeply. But to get a general idea, you should carefully consider your health and life expectancy, using data from the Social Security Administration and your family history. Also consider your tolerance for managing the risk of outliving your assets, access to other resources if you draw down your portfolio (for example, Social Security, a pension, or annuities), and other factors. This online calculator can help you determine your planning horizon. 2. How will you invest your portfolio? Stocks in retirement portfolios provide potential for future growth, to help support spending needs later in retirement. Cash and bonds, on the other hand, can add stability and can be used to fund spending needs early in retirement. Each investment serves its own role, so a good mix of all three—stocks, bonds and cash—is important. We find that asset allocation has a relatively small impact on your first-year sustainable withdrawal amount, unless you have a very conservative allocation and long retirement period. However, asset allocation can have a significant impact on the portfolio\\'s ending asset balance. In other words, a more aggressive asset allocation may have the potential to grow more over time, but the downside is that the \"bad\" years can be worse than with a more conservative allocation. Asset allocation can have a big impact on a portfolio’s ending balance Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Assumes a constant asset allocation, a 75% confidence level, and withdrawals growing by a constant 2.47% over 30 years. Assumes a starting balance of $1 million. Confidence level is defined as the number of times the portfolio ended with a balance greater than zero. See disclosures for additional disclosures on allocations and capital market estimates. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to represent a specific investment product and the example does not reflect the effects of taxes or fees. Remember, choosing an appropriate mix of investments may not be just a mathematical decision. Research shows that the pain of losses exceeds the pleasure in gains, and this effect can be magnified in retirement. Picking an allocation you\\'re comfortable with, especially in the event of a bear market, not just the one with the greatest possibility to increase the potential ending asset balance, is important. 3. How confident do you want to be that your money will last? Think of a confidence level as the percentage of times in which the hypothetical portfolio did not run out of money, based on a variety of assumptions and projections regarding potential future market performance. For example, a 90% confidence level means that, after projecting 1,000 scenarios using varying returns for stocks and bonds, 900 of the hypothetical portfolios were left with money at the end of the designated time period—anywhere from one cent to an amount more than the portfolio started with. We think aiming for a 75% to 90% confidence level is appropriate for most people, and sets a more comfortable spending limit, if you\\'re able to remain flexible and adjust if needed. Targeting a 90% confidence level means you will be spending less in retirement, with the trade-off that you are less likely to run out of money. If you regularly revisit your plan and are flexible if conditions change, 75% provides a reasonable confidence level between overspending and underspending. 4. Will you make changes if conditions change? This is the most important issue, and one that trumps all of the issues above. The 4% rule, as we mentioned, is a rigid guideline, which assumes you won\\'t change spending, change your investments, or make adjustments as conditions change. You aren\\'t a math formula, and neither is your retirement spending. If you make simple changes during a down market, like lowering your spending on a vacation or reducing or cutting expenses you don\\'t need, you can increase the likelihood that your money will last. Putting it all together After you\\'ve answered the above questions, you have a few options. The table below shows our calculations, to give you an estimate of a sustainable initial withdrawal rate. Note that the table shows what you\\'d withdraw from your portfolio this year only. You would increase the amount by inflation each year thereafter—or ideally, re-review your spending plan based on the performance of your portfolio. (We suggest discussing a comprehensive retirement plan with an advisor, who can help you tailor your personalized withdrawal rate. Then update that plan regularly.) We assume that investors want the highest reasonable withdrawal rate, but not so high that your retirement savings will run short. In the table, we\\'ve highlighted the maximum and minimum suggested first-year sustainable withdrawal rates based on different time horizons. Then, we matched those time horizons with a general suggested asset allocation mix for that time period. For example, if you are planning on needing retirement withdrawals for 20 years, we suggest a moderately conservative asset allocation and a withdrawal rate between 4.9% and 5.4%. The table is based on projections using future 10-year projected portfolio returns and volatility, updated annually by Charles Schwab Investment Advisor, Inc. (CSIA). The same annually updated projected returns are used in retirement saving and spending planning tools and calculators at Schwab. Choose a withdrawal rate based on your time horizon, allocation, and confidence level Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research, using Charles Schwab Investment Advisory’s (CSIA) 2022 10-year long-term return estimates and volatility for large-cap stocks, mid/small-cap stocks, international stocks, bonds and cash investments. CSIA updates its return estimates annually, and withdrawal rates are updated accordingly. See the disclosures below for a summary of the Conservative, Moderately Conservative, Moderate, and Moderately Aggressive asset allocations. The Moderately Aggressive allocation is not our suggested asset allocation for any of the time horizons we use in the example. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to represent a specific investment product and the example does not reflect the effects of taxes or fees. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Again, these spending rates assume that you will follow that spending rule throughout the rest of your retirement and not make future changes in your spending plan. In reality, we suggest you review your spending rate at least annually.

The example is provided for illustrative purposes. Here are some additional items to keep in mind: If you are regularly spending above the rate indicated by the 75% confidence level (as shown in the first table), we suggest spending less. If you\\'re subject to required minimum distributions, consider those as part of your withdrawal amount. Be sure to factor in Social Security, a pension, annuity income, or other non-portfolio income when determining your annual spending. This analysis estimates the amount you can withdraw from your investable portfolio based on your time horizon and desired confidence, not total spending using all sources of income. For example, if you need $50,000 annually but receive $10,000 from Social Security, you don\\'t need to withdraw the whole $50,000 from your portfolio—just the $40,000 difference. Rather than just interest and dividends, a balanced portfolio should also generate capital gains. We suggest using all sources of portfolio income to support spending. Investing primarily for interest and dividends may inadvertently skew your portfolio away from your desired asset allocation, and may not deliver the combination of stability and growth required to help your portfolio last. The projections above and spending rates are before asset management fees, if any, or taxes. Pay those from the gross amount after taking withdrawals. Stay flexible—nothing ever goes exactly as planned Our analysis—as well as the original 4% rule—assumes that you increase your spending amount by the rate of inflation each year regardless of market performance. However, life isn\\'t so predictable. Remember, stay flexible, and evaluate your plan annually or when significant life events occur. If the market performs poorly, you may not be comfortable increasing your spending at all. If the market does well, you may be more inclined to spend more on some \"nice to haves,\" medical expenses, or on leaving a legacy. Bottom line The transition from saving to spending from your portfolio can be difficult. There will never be a single \"right\" answer to how much you can withdraw from your portfolio in retirement. What\\'s important is to have a plan and a general guideline for spending—and then monitor and adjust, based on your circumstances, as necessary. The goal, after all, isn\\'t to worry about complicated calculations about spending. It\\'s to enjoy your retirement. 1 The tables show sustainable initial withdrawal rates calculated by simulating 1,000 random scenarios using different confidence levels (i.e., probability of success), time horizons and asset allocation. \"Confidence\" is calculated as the percentage of times where the portfolio\\'s ending balance was greater than The tables show sustainable initial withdrawal rates calculated by simulating 1.

       "   'content': 'If you have a 401(k), you may know you can transfer—or \"roll over\"—the funds into an IRA. But did you know that rollovers work both ways? Enter the reverse rollover, which lets you move funds from an existing IRA into your current 401(k), assuming your plan allows it. Here are two scenarios where a reverse rollover may make sense: 1. You want to delay your required minimum distributions (RMDs) If you\\'re still working when you reach age 72 and you own 5% or less of your company\\'s stock, your employer may allow you to delay taking RMDs from your 401(k) until you retire. Unfortunately, you\\'ll still need to take RMDs from your IRAs. \"However, rolling an IRA into your 401(k) would allow you to delay those RMDs, too,\" says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"This could be ideal for workers whose RMDs would push them into a higher tax bracket.\" 2. You want to perform a tax-free Roth IRA conversion If your traditional IRA contains both pretax and posttax contributions, a Roth conversion will be taxable in proportion to the pretax value of the account (known as the pro rata rule). For example, let\\'s say you have a $400,000 IRA that\\'s 75% pretax contributions ($300,000) and 25% posttax contributions ($100,000). If you converted $100,000 to a Roth IRA, you\\'d owe tax on 75% of the converted amount. On the other hand, rolling all $300,000 in pretax contributions into your employer\\'s 401(k) could allow you to convert the remaining $100,000 to a Roth IRA tax-free. Calculating your pro rata percentages can be complex, so it\\'s best to consult with your plan sponsor and a tax advisor before moving forward with a reverse rollover and Roth conversion in order to avoid any unpleasant tax surprises. Proceed with caution That said, reverse rollovers do have some drawbacks. For one, your money can be locked up in the 401(k) until you retire, excepting loans and financial hardship. \"IRAs, on the other hand, permit withdrawals at any time—though you\\'ll owe a 10% early-withdrawal penalty if you\\'re younger than age 59 1/2,\" Hayden says. \"Plus, IRAs generally have more investment options than 401(k)s, so bear that in mind when weighing your options.\"'}],\n",

So what can income-hungry investors do now? One potential solution is business development companies (BDCs), which provide financing to fledgling or struggling companies that may be unable to obtain bank loans or raise capital elsewhere. Because BDCs—which trade like stocks but are managed like funds—invest in higher-risk businesses, they can charge higher interest rates on their loans and, in turn, provide attractive yields for investors. The tax structure of BDCs may also bolster yields. \"BDCs can elect to be taxed as regulated investment companies, which means they\\'re exempt from corporate income tax so long as they distribute at least 90% of their profits, typically as dividends, to shareholders,\" says Steven P. Greiner, Ph.D., managing director of Schwab Equity Ratings® at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"The result is high-single-digit to low-double-digit yields that far outpace many traditional fixed income products and even some dividend stocks.\" As with other high-yield investments, however, BDCs should be approached with caution. \"First and foremost, most BDCs are publicly traded companies—not bonds—and come with the same market risks as other equities,\" Steven says. Beyond that, BDCs: Are sensitive to interest rates. BDCs use borrowed money to provide financing to other companies at higher rates. As interest rates rise, a BDC\\'s profit margins could suffer. Are subject to credit risk. The types of companies BDCs invest in may be more likely to default on their loans or even go out of business, which could undermine overall returns. Charge high fees. In addition to their relatively steep management and service fees (typically ranging from 1.5% to 2%), BDCs may charge up to 20% in incentive fees on profits earned.1 Lack transparency. Because BDCs generally invest in private companies, which aren\\'t required to make public disclosures, it can be difficult to assess a BDC\\'s true risk-reward profile. Those who feel comfortable taking on these risks might still consider investing in a BDC exchange-traded fund or mutual fund rather than an individual BDC. \"Funds provide exposure to multiple BDCs in a single investment, which reduces the impact any one BDC will have on your portfolio,\" Steven says. \"That said, remember that BDCs are relatively risky and should be viewed as part of your stock allocation, not your fixed income portfolio.\" 1 \"Investor Bulletin: Publicly Traded Business Development Companies (BDCs),\" U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 09/25/2020.'},\n",

Triple threat The number of identity fraud cases more than tripled in just two years as cybercriminals found new ways to exploit consumer data. Source: Federal Trade Commission. \"The question is, What are you going to do to keep thieves from capitalizing on your data?\" says Lisa DeVos, director of financial crimes risk management at Charles Schwab. \"Because there\\'s a lot you can do.\" To protect against new accounts being opened in your name: Initiate a credit freeze: Start by placing a freeze on your credit report with each of the three credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—which makes it much more challenging for cybercriminals to open in your name a new account or loan that requires a credit check. Should you need to apply for credit in the future, you can temporarily lift a freeze using a password or personal identification number. \"Consider freezing your kids\\' credit reports, too,\" Lisa says. \"Children may be more alluring targets for criminals because parents don\\'t typically review a minor\\'s credit history as often as they do their own.\" Request fraud alerts: You can place a fraud alert with any one of the three credit bureaus, which must then instruct the other two agencies to do the same. This option, which you\\'ll need to renew annually, requires businesses to verify your identity before opening a new line of credit in your name. \"This is particularly beneficial as a means of protection if you already know your data has been exposed in a breach,\" Lisa says. To protect the accounts you already own: Enroll in multifactor authentication: Keeping your login credentials safe is a key step in protecting your accounts from unauthorized access. Consider adding multifactor authentication—a two-step process that requires a unique code sent via email or text each time you attempt to log in to a given account. \"Many financial firms already require it when accessing accounts from unfamiliar devices,\" Lisa says, \"and many more offer it as an optional precaution in all instances.\" Monitor account activity: Although most firms offer security alerts, you should still regularly review your financial accounts for fraudulent activity. \"No algorithm is as good as you at spotting suspicious behavior,\" Lisa says. \"With identity fraud on the rise, it\\'s important to do whatever you can to shield your sensitive information from criminals,\" Lisa says. \"Fortunately, just a little bit of protection can go a long way.\"'},\n",

       "   'content': 'For many families, life insurance is a way to replace lost income in the event a parent or spouse dies unexpectedly. But it can also be a valuable estate-planning tool for those who want to leave significant wealth to their heirs. \"Inheriting a large sum is not without its challenges,\" says Austin Jarvis, director of trust, tax, and estate at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"But with the right life insurance policy, you can ensure your heirs are able to address those challenges without having to break up the estate.\" Life insurance—yes or no? There are two main types of life insurance: Term life insurance, which provides coverage for a fixed period of time (typically between 10 and 30 years). This is best suited for those with finite insurance needs—say, to provide for minor children until they come of age. The limited coverage makes it relatively affordable, particularly for young, healthy individuals. Permanent life insurance, on the other hand, provides lifetime coverage, making it suitable for estate-planning purposes. However, such coverage can come at a steep cost—typically five to 15 times that of a term policy—so \"you should generally purchase permanent life insurance only if your estate is large or complex enough to demand it,\" Austin says. In particular, permanent life insurance is most beneficial to those who want or need to: Pay estate taxes: Estates worth more than $12.06 million ($24.12 million for married couples) in 2022 are subject to taxation of up to 40%. What\\'s more, the tax bill is typically due within nine months of the estate owner\\'s death, which can pose a burden on heirs who inherit estates with significant illiquid assets, such as art, real estate, or a business. \"A life insurance payout can keep your heirs from having to rush to sell those assets, potentially at below-market valuations,\" Austin says. Even if your estate doesn\\'t exceed the current exemption, future tax changes are inevitable. \"Over the past five decades, there have been no fewer than 10 significant changes to federal estate tax laws, which creates a lot of uncertainty when it comes to estate planning,\" Austin adds. Eliminate inheritance inequities: It\\'s not uncommon for an estate owner to have assets that are difficult to divvy up among their heirs. \"Family businesses and real estate, in particular, can be tough to bequeath to multiple heirs—especially if they don\\'t have a shared vision for that asset,\" Austin says. \"With life insurance, you can leave bigger assets to the appropriate heirs and offset any inheritance inequities with a policy of similar value.\" Provide for a special-needs heir: \"When you have an heir who may never be able to provide for themselves, creating a plan for their financial security is paramount,\" Austin says. But the cost of lifelong care can undercut other heirs\\' inheritances. \"In such cases, life insurance can be a great way to provide specific financial support for an heir with special needs while leaving the rest of the estate intact,\" Austin says. Just be careful when leaving assets to a special-needs heir who receives government benefits, as such payouts have strict income limits (see \"Special needs trust,\" below). How to deploy it effectively Taking out a large life insurance policy can also add to the value of your estate, potentially diminishing the benefit of purchasing the policy in the first place. However, if you name an irrevocable trust as the beneficiary of your policies, the proceeds generally can be excluded from your estate and therefore be exempt from federal estate taxes. In addition, it provides immediate liquidity for your heirs to cover any outstanding estate fees or necessary expenses. Two popular types of irrevocable trusts are often funded by life insurance: Irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT): In such arrangements, the grantor transfers ownership of an existing policy to the ILIT or pays the premiums on a policy purchased by the trust. Since the ILIT\\'s ownership of the policy is irrevocable—meaning it cannot be changed—the proceeds would not be considered part of your estate.1 Once the trust receives the policy\\'s proceeds, the trustee can use the funds to cover taxes and fees and/or manage payouts to heirs. Special needs trust (SNT): For dependents with disabilities, a direct inheritance of as little as $2,000 could reduce or eliminate their government benefits. Creating an irrevocable SNT can help avoid this pitfall by stipulating that it will cover only qualified education, equipment, insurance, and medical expenses not covered by federal or state benefits. \"Because the trustee pays the heir\\'s expenses directly, no money flows to the dependent, which should preserve her or his government benefits,\" Austin says. Act fast If you\\'re looking to incorporate life insurance into your estate plan, Austin advises consulting an estate attorney and a tax professional as soon as possible. \"The younger and healthier you are, the cheaper your policy will be,\" Austin says. \"Generally speaking, once you\\'ve decided that life insurance is right for you, the time to act is now.\" 1The proceeds generally are excluded from the insured\\'s gross estate as long as the insured didn\\'t hold any incidents of ownership (such as changing the beneficiary or borrowing against the policy) at the time of death or within the three-year period prior to death.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I\\'m 60 years old, thinking about retirement, and worried about my future health care costs. What can I do now to prepare? -A Reader Dear Reader, Even if you\\'ve been saving diligently, health care costs can throw a wrench in your retirement plans. A 2020 report from the Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates a 65-year-old couple could need as much as $325,000 in savings to cover their health care expenses in retirement. Fortunately, you\\'ve still got some time to plan ahead for health care expenses. Here are four strategies to consider now. 1. Make the most of an HSA If you\\'re enrolled in a high-deductible health care plan that offers a health savings account (HSA), consider using it to sock away extra money for future medical needs. You can make tax-deductible contributions1 of up to $3,650 ($7,300 for a family) in 2022—plus an additional $1,000 for those ages 55 and older—which can be invested for potential growth. Plus, earnings grow tax-free, and withdrawals of contributions and earnings are tax- and penalty-free when used for qualified health care expenses, including Medicare and long-term care (LTC) insurance premiums. And once you reach age 65, withdrawals from an HSA can be used for any purpose without penalty, although ordinary income taxes will apply to funds used for nonmedical expenses. 2. Enroll in Medicare at the right time Most near-retirees know Medicare becomes available at age 65, but fewer realize there\\'s a permanent penalty for missing the initial enrollment period (IEP). Your IEP is a seven-month span, including the three months before, the month of, and the three months following your 65th birthday. If you fail to apply during your IEP for Medicare Part B—which covers most everyday (outpatient) medical expenses—your monthly Part B premiums could go up 10% for every 12-month period you go without coverage. There\\'s also a 1% penalty per month for each month you delay enrolling in Part D prescription drug coverage. If you begin collecting Social Security before your 65th birthday, you\\'ll automatically be enrolled in Part A (which covers hospital stays and is generally premium-free) and Part B. But if you plan on waiting to collect Social Security, be sure to apply for Medicare as soon as you\\'re eligible. If you or your spouse is still working and enrolled in an employer\\'s health care plan, you may be able to delay Part B coverage without penalty until you retire (though you should still enroll in Part A). Once you enroll in Medicare, however, you can no longer contribute to an HSA, so keep that in mind as you develop your plan. 3. Reduce your taxable income Medicare premiums are also affected by income level. Relatively higher-earning retirees may be subject to Medicare\\'s Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA), which is a surcharge on the monthly premiums for Parts B and D if your income exceeds $91,000 ($182,000 for married couples filing jointly). The differences in premiums for Part B, in particular, can be steep (see \"A premium on premiums,\" below), so taking steps to reduce your taxable income could lower your medical costs, as well. A premium on premiums A single filer making just $23,000 more than the income limit for the standard Part B premium could see their monthly payments increase by 100%. Source: Medicare.gov. 2022 premiums are determined by the recipient’s 2020 modified adjusted gross income. If most of your retirement savings are in tax-deferred accounts, one solution is to convert some of those funds to a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals once you reach age 59½ and have held the account for five years. You\\'ll have to pay taxes on the converted amount in the year of the conversion, but Roth IRAs are not subject to taxable required minimum distributions (RMDs) like tax-deferred accounts are, helping you to better manage your taxable income in retirement. Be aware, however, that Medicare uses your modified adjusted gross income from the \"prior-prior\" year to calculate premiums. For example, the income on your 2020 tax return determines the IRMAA you pay in 2022. Another option is to contribute to a Roth 401(k), if offered by your employer. These accounts are also funded with after-tax dollars, though they are subject to RMDs (albeit tax-free) starting at age 72. 4. Plan for long-term care Long-term care insurance can seem expensive—premiums average $1,700 annually for a healthy 55-year-old man and $2,675 for a woman of the same age—but with the average annual cost of a private room in a nursing home at nearly $106,000, it may be more expensive not to have it. The most cost-effective time to buy is between ages 50 and 65, and premiums may be tax-deductible if your overall medical expenses exceed 7.5% of your income. A financial planner can help you strategize whether long-term care insurance makes sense for you, as well as discuss alternatives. 1HSA contributions are exempt from federal income tax, as well as state income tax in all states except California or New Jersey. Distributions used for nonqualified medical expenses are subject to ordinary income tax and, for those under age 65, are subject to a 20% penalty'},\n",

       "   'content': 'The energy sector is entering an era of cleaner and more sustainable business practices thanks to technological innovations, investor demand, and government policies. In 2020, renewable energy generation in the U.S. surpassed that from both coal and nuclear energy for the first time ever,1 and by March 2021 nearly a fifth of the world\\'s largest companies had set net-zero goals. There are many signs these trends will continue, including broad international support and the United Nations\\' ambitious goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. While the transition away from fossil fuels may take decades to complete—and many risks exist as companies attempt to shift their business models—there may be opportunities along the way that can benefit investors and help support the shift to a cleaner future. Here are three ways investors can navigate the rapidly changing landscape. 1. Watch the trends Among the most important developments in the approach to climate change are: Clean-energy innovation: Solar energy output could supply as much as 40% of the country\\'s electricity within the next 15 years, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Better solar and wind storage systems developed by various companies already allow more of us to harness the power generated on our own rooftops—rain or shine. This is just the tip of the iceberg, and advancement in energy efficiency should be watched, as well. Clean-energy policies and investor demands: Amid public insistence and global agreement, more government funding for clean-energy incentives and mandates is on the way. Regulations aside, many companies are already pivoting toward more environmentally friendly practices in response to consumer and investor demand. Carbon-capture technology: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is also on the upswing. As of September 2021, at least 27 commercial-scale carbon-capture projects were in operation worldwide and an additional 106 were in development.2 Electric vehicle adoption: From 2015 through 2020, the combined number of all-electric and hybrid vehicles on the road in the U.S. more than tripled,3 and number of combustion-engine vehicles within the global fleet will peak in 2038, according to government projections.4 2. Lean into the transition Investors who want to participate in the energy transition might consider three key categories of companies: Clean-energy innovators: Solar and wind companies are developing new technologies to make renewable energy less expensive and more efficient, and new energy sources (such as green hydrogen, which is made with water) may be added to the mix. Furthermore, innovations for reducing emissions—such as ultraefficient jet engines, energy-saving construction methods, and power grids managed by artificial intelligence—will be important drivers in the space. All these advancements are likely to require new manufacturing techniques, electronics, semiconductors, and materials to make them possible.

As they work to achieve these goals—likely in concert with clean-energy innovators, such as those developing new carbon-capture techniques—these heavy energy users will potentially profit from cheaper cost of capital, lower expenses, and greater customer allegiance.

Many are switching electricity generation from coal to natural gas in a bid to reduce carbon output, and some have added wind and solar power to the mix. In addition, utility companies in some regions are encouraging battery storage, residential solar, smart electric meters, and other innovations that improve energy efficiency. A word of caution: This transition comes at a high cost, so government policies mandating changes could undercut profits in the near term. In the oil-and-gas industry, some of the biggest companies—especially those based in Europe—are making strides in reducing their emissions. Many have invested in solar facilities and wind farms. Others are investing in cleaner hydrogen technology that will be needed to power heavy trucks and industrial machinery. It may seem counterintuitive to seek opportunities in this space, but companies that are quick to embrace a new model could be well positioned to succeed in a cleaner-energy world. How to invest Because oil-and-gas and utility companies are unique to the areas they serve, a fund could dilute the achievements of any one company. As such, investing in individual securities may be the better approach.

Beware the hype As with any area of investing that’s undergoing seismic change, it\\'s important to not get caught up in the mania. Be sure to separate those companies that are walking the walk from those that are merely talking the talk—or investigate mutual funds or ETFs that do it for you. Consulting current research from reputable sources, as well as paying attention to news and trends in the clean energy space, can help you evaluate the opportunities outlined above based on your own priorities and appetite for risk. 1U.S. Energy Information Administration, 07/28/2021. 2Global Status of CCS 2021, Global CCS Institute, 2021. 3Global EV Outlook 2021, International Energy Agency, 04/2021. 4U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10/26/2021.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Three tips for incorporating a large influx of assets into your financial plan.',\n",
       "   'content': \"What would you do if you suddenly came into a life-changing amount of money? It may sound like a dream come true, but such a payout can prove complicated if not managed wisely. To paraphrase the Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger: A great fortune can be a great servitude. Even those who've spent their lives building a successful business to sell for a substantial gain can be caught off guard by the emotional and financial ramifications of a big influx of assets. With that in mind, here are three tips for managing such a payout—with an eye toward the future. 1. Reassess your goals Depending on the size of the windfall, some of your goals—such as saving for a child's education or amassing a substantial nest egg—might feel less urgent than they once did, but that doesn't mean you should deprioritize them. It's wise to work with a financial planner who can help you take stock of your new financial reality and adjust your plan accordingly. Next, consider how you'd like to put your payout to work. If your hope is to reinvest some of the capital in a new venture, for example, be sure to stash that money in a stable, liquid investment—such as an interest-bearing certificate of deposit—that won't lose value while you sort out your plans. Or, if your goal is to grow your wealth in the stock market, consider working with an investment advisor who can help balance long-term appreciation with wealth preservation. 2. Consider the taxman Depending on the form the payout takes, you could face a significant tax bill—or potentially none at all. Gains from the sale of a business, for example, are taxed at short- or long-term capital gains rates, which can be as much as 40.8% for those in the highest tax bracket. However, if those gains came from the sale of qualified small business stock (QSBS) and you held the shares for at least five years, you may be able to exclude 50% of the gains from your tax liability. If you didn't hold the assets that long, you may be able to defer taxes by reinvesting the gains in a new qualified business within 60 days. If your wealth comes in the form of company stock, you might be on the hook for two forms of tax: ordinary income tax at the time the shares vest and capital gains tax when you sell the shares. The taxation of equity compensation ultimately depends on the type of stock award you receive, so consider consulting a tax specialist who can help you strategize the best way to liquidate your holdings. In the case of an inheritance, even after any estate and/or inheritance taxes are settled, you could still owe taxes at some point in the future if the bequest came in the form of: Investments, including real estate: The value of the inherited investment generally resets to the current market value at the time of death,1 but any future gains on the asset will be taxed at the prevailing capital gains rates at the time of the sale. For example, if you inherit shares of a stock worth $500,000 at the time of the decedent's death and you sell them for $600,000 two years later, you'll owe long-term capital gains taxes on the $100,000 gain. Retirement assets: Nonspouse heirs who inherit a tax-deferred retirement account, such as a 401(k) or an IRA, generally are required to liquidate the account within 10 years—and pay ordinary income tax on the withdrawals.2 Inherited Roth IRAs, too, must be depleted within a decade, but heirs will not owe any tax on the withdrawals. Tax laws are often in flux, so it's wise to work with a tax expert who can help you find the right strategies and set enough money aside for tax time. 3. Protect your legacy Finally, be sure your estate plan reflects your new financial situation. Whatever your goals—from creating a generational wealth plan to leaving a charitable legacy—a financial planner can assist you in fine-tuning your strategy to help preserve your expanded wealth for years to come. 1If the decedent resided in a separate property state, her or his sole property, plus 50% of any jointly owned property, will receive a step-up in basis. Community property states, on the other hand, do not have a consistent treatment for the cost basis of inherited assets. Consult a tax advisor for more information. 2An heir may be exempt from the 10-year distribution rule if he or she is the minor child of the account owner, 10 or fewer years younger than the account owner, or disabled or chronically ill as defined by the IRS.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'A spousal lifetime access trust (SLAT) allows access to assets while helping to keep them out of your taxable estate.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Last year, House Democrats proposed cutting the federal estate- and gift-tax exemption nearly in half to help fund a sweeping budget and spending package. Even though the exemption ultimately remained unchanged (12.06 million per individual and $24.12 million for married couples), it reminded those with larger estates how quickly laws can change and, thus, how invaluable proper planning can be. For married couples looking to lock in today\\'s limit without sacrificing access to their assets, one option to consider is a spousal lifetime access trust (SLAT), which is irrevocable and provides payouts to the beneficiary spouse while excluding the trust\\'s assets from the donor (or grantor) spouse’s gross taxable estate. Let’s look at how SLATs work and what to consider before potentially creating one. The mechanics The donor spouse gifts cash, life insurance, marketable securities, real estate, or other assets of which he or she is the sole owner to a SLAT and reports it on his or her gift tax return. (Those who reside in one of the nine community property states—Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin—may first need to convert community property assets into separate property assets, typically via a so-called partition agreement.) Once the SLAT is funded, the beneficiary spouse can request distributions of income or principal—from which the donor spouse too may benefit, albeit indirectly. Upon termination of the SLAT, typically at the death of the beneficiary spouse, the remaining trust assets pass to the remainder beneficiaries named in the trust document. For example, say Sarah and Neil have joint and separate assets totaling $30 million, which are likely to further appreciate while they\\'re still alive. Were they to transfer $12.06 million each into two SLATs benefiting each other (see \"Dual SLATs,\" below), they would be able to exclude the full $24.12 million—plus any future appreciation and income—from their taxable estates while still benefiting from those assets. They would then have available their remaining $5.88 million in shared assets, plus their SLAT distributions, to support their ongoing income needs. Potential drawbacks SLATs may seem like a way to have your cake and eat it, too, but there are risks. First and foremost, if your spouse suddenly passes away, you lose your indirect access to her or his SLAT payouts. The same is true in the case of divorce, unless you include a provision that states your trust is for the benefit of your current and future spouses, in which case you can regain indirect access to the assets once you remarry. Be aware, too, that assets held in a SLAT do not receive a step-up in cost basis at the donor spouse\\'s death, potentially increasing the capital gains tax liability to the remainder beneficiaries. Trust considerations A third-party trustee is often a good idea for trusts of substantial size, but it\\'s perhaps even more favorable in the case of SLATs. That\\'s because if the beneficiary spouse serves as trustee, distributions must be limited to the health, education, maintenance, and support (HEMS) standard—which is determined at the SLAT\\'s creation and cannot be changed—whereas a third-party trustee has more discretion and could increase distributions above HEMS, if warranted. That said, if you do name your beneficiary spouse as the trustee, you can add a provision that gives her or him the option of appointing an independent trustee. Another popular trust clause—known as the \"5 or 5 power\"—allows the beneficiary spouse to annually withdraw up to $5,000 or 5% of trust assets, whichever is greater, in addition to HEMS. Mind the complexities While changes in tax law are hard to predict, a SLAT may be an effective wealth-transfer strategy to consider while the lifetime gift and estate exemption remains at historically high levels. However, a SLAT strategy should be undertaken only with the help of an experienced estate planning attorney, who can determine if it makes sense for your personal circumstances and help guide you through some of the more nuanced legal complexities. Dual SLATs If you and your spouse both want to create a SLAT to benefit the other, beware the so-called reciprocal trust doctrine, which states that spouses cannot create substantially similar trusts. Any trusts found to be in violation of the doctrine will be ignored for federal tax purposes. To ensure that your and your spouse\\'s SLAT documents have enough differences, consider drafting the documents at different times, naming different trustees and remainder beneficiaries, and providing different termination provisions, among other approaches.

       "   'abstract': 'More and more Americans are establishing second homes abroad. Here’s how to prepare your finances before making the move.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Nearly 9 million Americans live outside the U.S. full or part time, according to the State Department. And that number may well increase. Thanks to technology that makes it easier to work remotely and stay connected to family and friends, decamping for another country has never been easier. However, setting up shop abroad can require a good deal of advance preparation—on matters ranging from banking and taxes to health care and estate planning. \"I advise clients to get the ball rolling as early as possible, as there are several big items you\\'ll need to check off your list to ensure a smooth transition,\" says George Lee, director at Schwab Asset Management Solutions. Visas When planning your move abroad, first make sure your U.S. travel documents are in order. \"As a general rule, passports must be valid for at least six months beyond the date the traveler exits the United States,\" says Susan Poss, a Schwab Private Client advisor in Orlando, Florida. \"So, if your passport is nearing expiration, be sure to get it renewed before you even apply for a visa.\" To check the visa requirements for your new home country, contact its embassy. Most nations require a long-stay visa for visits longer than 90 days. However, some countries, like Greece, Portugal, and St. Lucia, offer residency, multiyear visas, and even citizenship to foreigners who invest a minimum amount in real estate or the local economy. Similarly, many countries, including Malaysia and Thailand, offer special visas for retirees—typically those ages 50 or above—who meet specific income requirements. Next, gather and submit all the necessary documents, which typically will include not just a valid passport and the completed visa application but also proof of accommodation, health insurance, and that you have enough money to support yourself during your stay. (That\\'s assuming you aren\\'t seeking official employment or looking to start a business in your new home country, which carries other implications—see \"Taxes,\" below.) Then prepare to be patient. Some embassies are more efficient than others, and the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t made the process any easier. In some cases, such as when a short-term trip turns into an extended stay, you may want to consult with an immigration lawyer, who can help with everything from renewing visas to establishing permanent residency. Banking Many expatriates maintain dual bank accounts: one in their home country to handle ongoing payments or transfers, and another in their destination country. Overseas accounts can take time to set up, sometimes requiring a local address that\\'s not a hotel or P.O. box. In the meantime, maintain sufficient funds in a bank that operates globally or that offers reliable access to ATM networks abroad and can process transfers quickly. Some offerings—such as Charles Schwab Bank’s High Yield Investor Checking® account—even eliminate foreign transaction fees. Here, too, advance planning can help. Notify your U.S. financial institutions that you\\'re leaving and for how long, so when you tap your assets abroad it won’t be flagged as fraud. You may also need to report overseas bank and investment accounts annually to the IRS—especially those with balances topping $10,000—or face stiff penalties. And don\\'t overlook the currency fluctuations that can affect your purchasing power abroad. \"How far will your U.S. dollar go in a different currency—and how might currency fluctuations affect your wealth?\" George asks. \"I\\'ve seen such fluctuations negatively impact a client\\'s wealth—but they can also be used to your advantage.\" For instance, if the dollar is currently strong against the local currency but you\\'re concerned it will weaken, you may wish to transfer more of your U.S. dollars to your local bank account to capture the advantageous exchange rate. Taxes Moving abroad invokes the risk of double taxation since the U.S. is one of the few countries that taxes by citizenship, not residence. This means in addition to paying taxes to their country of residence, American expats must also pay taxes to the U.S., including on all capital gains, interest, rental, and ordinary income. An IRS provision, the Foreign Tax Credit, can help reduce one\\'s tax exposure in the U.S. There are also dozens of tax treaties between the U.S. and other countries that can further limit the potential for double taxation. For longer-term expatriates, the IRS also offers the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, which allows U.S. citizens who can demonstrate they were abroad for 330 days in a 12-month period to exclude up to $108,700 in foreign earnings from U.S. taxes for the 2021 tax year. Also check to see if your state requires you to file taxes. Some states can be aggressive in collecting tax revenues no matter how much of the year you spend away, so it may be worth establishing residence in one of the seven states that have no personal income tax—Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, or Wyoming—prior to moving overseas. Given the potential pitfalls, it’s advisable to consult with a qualified tax expert. \"Be sure to find a tax attorney who is versed in both domestic and international tax laws—and the potential conflicts between the two,\" says Lisa Chen, a senior private client advisor with Schwab Private Client\\'s Global Advice Team in San Francisco. The U.S. distinguishes between filing as single versus married, for example, and between short- and long-term capital gains, whereas other countries may not honor these distinctions. Tax years, too, may not align, with some countries following the calendar year while others do not. \"It\\'s worth your time to hire a cross-border CPA, because there are a lot of nuances,\" Susan says. \"Not all accountants understand this.\" Health care For those who are nearing or in retirement, be aware that Medicare generally won\\'t cover medical expenses incurred outside the U.S. That said, you should generally still sign up for Medicare and any Medicare supplements as soon as you\\'re eligible—typically at age 65—or potentially face stiff penalties. (If you\\'re abroad when you turn 65, you have three months after you return to sign up for Medicare Part B.) If you fail to immediately sign up for Part B, your premiums will increase 10% for every 12-month period during which you were eligible but not enrolled. Depending on your country of residence, you could qualify for its national health care plan, which could provide wide-ranging coverage for affordable monthly premiums. If so, consider keeping Medicare Part A (covering hospital care) if you don\\'t have to pay a premium, while forgoing Medicare Advantage and prescription-drug plans. Enrolling in Part B depends in part on whether you anticipate seeing doctors in the U.S. often enough to justify the monthly premiums. Whatever your coverage in the U.S., you will likely require separate coverage for your time abroad. Many major insurers, including Aetna, Blue Shield, and Cigna, offer private insurance plans tailored to expats. In any event, make sure you remain current with any local immunization mandates, and ask your doctor for electronic copies of medical records you can store in a secure cloud service. Estate planning Updating your estate plan may be necessary to accommodate foreign laws regarding the distribution of assets, inheritance and gift taxes, probate, and succession. \"Inadequate planning can lead to assets passing to the wrong beneficiaries or unnecessarily high taxes,\" Lisa says. Twenty U.S. states and the District of Columbia—plus 20 foreign countries1—recognize a uniform international will. For states and countries that do not, you may need to create a multijurisdictional will or supplement your primary will with a so-called situs will tailored to your adopted country. For example, if you have assets in Delaware, Florida, Spain, and the U.K., an international will would cover assets in Delaware and the U.K., but you may need separate wills for Florida and Spain. Be clear in all your wills and documents about how assets should be distributed in both countries and keep your trustees up to date with instructions on how to act if anything happens to you. Some countries require your executor to be a local resident. In any case, it\\'s important to find an attorney familiar with estate laws in your destination country. \"If you own real estate or hold or transfer other assets abroad, make sure you understand the estate laws in your adopted country,\" Susan says. \"For example, how should assets be titled to ensure a smooth transition to your intended heirs? Will your assets abroad be subject to probate and/or inheritance taxes? A local estate attorney should be able to provide you with all the necessary information.\" Intangibles As you prepare to navigate the financial hurdles of moving abroad, don\\'t discount the potential emotional challenges. \"Living in another country is a dream for many people, but the reality is that it can be emotionally isolating if you don’t have a support system in place,\" Susan says. Before you commit, consider taking a few extended trips to your desired location during different seasons to get a feel for daily living and begin building a community. \"You can always come home, of course,\" George adds, \"but it\\'s better to know what you\\'re getting into before you put in the time—and money—that a move abroad requires.\" 1The 20 U.S. states that recognize a uniform international will are Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The 20 countries that recognize a uniform international will are Australia, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, the Holy See, Iran, Italy, Laos, Libya, Niger, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'After months of laying the groundwork for monetary policy tightening, the Federal Reserve now faces a sudden change in the economic outlook.',\n",
       "   'content': 'There\\'s an old Scottish saying that \"the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.\" That phrase probably captures the thinking of many members of the Federal Reserve these days. After months of laying the groundwork for a steady and substantial tightening in monetary policy over the next year, the Federal Reserve now faces a sudden change in the economic outlook. Six months ago, the focus was on the economy\\'s strong rebound from the pandemic and tightening labor market. It seemed clear that the Fed would need to tighten policy quickly to bring down inflation. Today, the picture is far more complicated. The outbreak of war in Ukraine and subsequent economic sanctions on Russia have caused a surge in commodity prices, due to the prospects of reduced supplies flowing to the markets. The result has seen inflation rise to its highest levels in over 40 years. However, while these supply-side shocks are exacerbating already high inflation, they also can slow growth down the road. Moreover, this crisis is global in scale, and involves intense efforts to cut Russia\\'s access to the global financial system, which could put stress on Europe\\'s financial system. The unknown consequences of these factors make the actions of the U.S. central bank important to the international economy as well as the U.S. economy. Given all these uncertainties, expectations about the path of Fed policy have swung wildly in the past few weeks. Two-year Treasury note yields, which largely reflect expectations about the path of the federal funds rate over the next few years, have traded in a huge 35-basis-point range since the outbreak of the Ukraine war. Price and supply shocks Past price shocks have tended to produce two outcomes: higher inflation and slower growth. The U.S. economy has suffered through oil price shocks in the past—especially during the 1970s oil embargoes. The result was a period of \"stagflation\" and recessions. More recently, oil prices have seen periods of large increases in the mid-2000s without necessarily triggering recessions. Today, the U.S. economy is less sensitive to rising energy costs than in the past due to the rise in domestic production, shift to other fuel sources, and increasing efficiency in energy usage. Nonetheless, surging energy costs can slow economic growth by acting as a tax on consumer incomes, reducing business investment, and eroding consumer confidence and spending. Estimates of the impact to gross domestic product (GDP) vary from a reduction of 0.2% to as much as 1.0% over the next 12 months. Fortunately, the U.S. economy has been growing at a strong pace, which should help soften the blow to economic growth from higher energy costs. But it also is exacerbating an upturn in inflation spurred by supply shortages coming out of the pandemic and strong consumer demand. The impact on inflation is much easier to see since energy prices feed directly into calculations of CPI. As of the February report, surging energy costs have accounted for about a third of the increase in overall inflation. Rising energy prices have contributed significantly to overall Consumer Price Index growth Source: Bloomberg. Monthly data as of 1/31/2022. Chart shows U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) topline contributions and core CPI, year-over-year percent change. Longer-term outlook In recent congressional testimony, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank still planned to raise short-term interest rates by 25 basis points at its March 15-16 meeting. However, we believe there is a good chance that this will be a slower and shallower rate-hike cycle than previously anticipated, due to the potential for slower economic growth, easing inflation later in the year, and tightening financial conditions. Despite the recent spike, we expect inflation to ease later in the year as comparisons to year-ago readings level out, waning fiscal stimulus slows the pace of consumer demand, and tighter monetary policy tightens lending conditions. There are already signs of a slowdown in housing activity due to rising mortgage rates and business inventories rising relative to new orders. Mortgage applications have dropped Source: Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) mortgage applications (MAVCHNG Index). Data as of 2/25/2022. While the Fed\\'s policy setting is too easy for the current level of inflation and growth, financial conditions have tightened significantly in both the U.S and Europe in recent weeks, indicating rising level of financial stress. If credit spreads widen significantly and/or the dollar moves sharply higher, those would be signs that could make the Fed slow down its tightening. Financial conditions in the U.S. and Europe are tightening rapidly Source: Bloomberg.

The Z-Score that indicates the number of standard deviations by which current financial conditions deviate from the average. A positive value indicates accommodative financial conditions, while a negative value indicates tighter financial conditions. Lastly, long-run inflation expectations are relatively low compared to current inflation readings, signaling that the markets are not anticipating an inflationary spiral. The Fed watches this reading carefully, because inflation expectations are often thought to be self-fulfilling. Long-run inflation expectations are relatively muted Source: Bloomberg 5-year 5-year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate (USGG5Y5Y Index). Daily data as of 3/2/2022. Notes: A measure of the average expected inflation over the five-year period that begins five years from the date data are reported. The rates are composed of Generic United States Breakeven forward rates: nominal forward 5 years minus US inflation-linked bonds forward 5 years. In sum, although the folks at the Fed would like to pursue a steady path to raising short-term interest rates and reducing its balance sheet, it may not be as easy as they might have expected just a few weeks ago. We think it\\'s likely that the Fed will move cautiously in the months ahead, with four to five rate hikes this year. The Fed\\'s large balance sheet gives it a lot of flexibility to adjust financial conditions as needed. To date, it hasn\\'t laid out a plan. All else being equal, the Fed would probably begin to reduce its bond holdings in the second quarter with an eye to drawing it down by about $500 billion this year and potentially another $1 trillion in 2023.1 But the process can stop and start as the Fed sees fit, so it may become a more active tool of policy. Since the Fed has performed the role of lender of last resort in times when markets seize up, it will need to be sure it’s providing ample liquidity to global markets. What investors can do We would continue to be cautious about taking on significantly more risk in this environment. Markets are not only subject to rapid changes in the economic and policy outlook, but also shifting political decisions. Liquidity conditions in markets are also subject to sudden changes, which can make it challenging to enter or exit positions at reasonable prices. That said, volatility can create opportunities. For investors looking for opportunities, we suggest being sure that the size of those investments is in proportion to risk budget, rather than coming out of core positions. For reference, the historical performance of different assets classes during periods of high and low inflation are shown in the chart below.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For fixed income investors, we continue to suggest keeping average portfolio duration low, but to look for times when 10-year Treasury yields move above 2% to add a modest amount of duration. While Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are considered an inflation hedge, TIPS\\' current pricing makes them relatively expensive compared to our expectations. A core allocation to TIPS is still appropriate for times when inflation surges. Despite the uncertainties in the outlook for the economy and Fed policy, we believe investors should continue to hew to their \"best-laid plans.\" Those with a long-term strategy that suits their risk tolerance and capacity should stick with their plans. 1 The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy (Brookings Institution)'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'This International Women’s Day, let’s confront—and help break—the financial biases women still face.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, International Women\\'s Day is March 8 and this year\\'s theme is #BreakTheBias, with the goal of creating a gender equal world. To me that includes creating a world of equal financial opportunity. During my more than 30 years in financial services, a lot has changed for the better when it comes to women and investing. But there\\'s still a lot more we need to do to ensure women are not only treated fairly, but that their differences are respected—and valued. We need to actively break the biases that too often keep women from building wealth and living a life of financial independence, confidence and security. Here are five of the most common biases I feel women face when it comes to money and investing. If you\\'re a female investor, chances are you\\'ve come across a few of them personally. In fact, you may hold some yourself without being consciously aware of it. We all have biases of one sort or another; and most of us have felt the effects of these attitudes in our own lives. See if any of these particular biases resonate with you. 1. Women are afraid to take investment risk Let\\'s be honest. Women do tend to be more conservative investors. Why? A recent study explores possible reasons, ranging from a lack of financial literacy to lower confidence levels. But even when you take a financially savvy female investor who is reasonably confident in her ability to make investing decisions, you\\'ll still find that women in general tend to invest more conservatively and less actively than men. But guess what? Studies have also shown that women\\'s investing outcomes are often better than men\\'s for the very reason that women tend to trade less frequently and make fewer mistakes. Investing is a long game. Trading too frequently doesn\\'t mean better results. In fact, it can mean missing out on long-term growth. So is it fear—or level headedness? A common bias sees being risk averse as a negative. However, all smart investors understand that analysis of investment risk is an essential part of an individual investing plan. In fact, it has less to do with gender and more to do with thoughtful consideration of goals and timelines. 2. Women should save and invest just like men Really? To me women actually need to save and invest differently than men for a lot of reasons. Longer life expectancy is one. Increased time out of the workforce to care for others is another. Plus, greater longevitiy means women are more likely to need long-term care services down the road. Add in historically lower earnings, and to me it means women in some ways need to be more aggressive than men when planning for their financial future, especially when it comes to saving. Does that also mean trading more actively? Not necessarily. (See point #1.) But it does mean starting to save as early as possible, taking a long-term view, understanding the role of equities in creating wealth, and not underestimating the importance of establishing financial independence. Again, to me it\\'s not really a matter of gender. It\\'s a matter of what\\'s right for your own financial security. 3. Women ask too many questions This is a negative cultural bias that\\'s not exclusive to investing. But I think it\\'s relevant because asking questions can be incorrectly perceived as a lack of confidence, which is something women seem prone to when it comes to finances, as I mentioned earlier. But in my experience, asking too few questions—or questions after the fact—is one of the areas where investors often go wrong. My advice? If you don\\'t know something, ask. If you need more information, ask. If you want a second opinion, ask. And if your advisor isn\\'t willing to answer your questions, find another one. 4. Women aren\\'t household financial decision makers That might have been true in the past, but things are quickly changing. Today, nearly 9 in 10 women who are married or live with a partner said they are involved in spending and investing decisions in their household, up from less than half a decade ago. I find this encouraging because increasing financial literacy and financial opportunity for women is one of my passions. I believe it\\'s extremely important for women to be part of financial decision-making in every family—and to have resources and opportunities to achieve their own financial independence. So to the entire financial industry and anyone dealing with money matters, I say be careful not to underestimate the role women play today in making important financial decisions. 5. One-size-fits-all when it comes to financial advice for women There\\'s an old marketing concept that\\'s been used to target products to women known as \"pink it and shrink it.\" The idea is if you just give something a traditionally feminine color and make it simpler, women will go for it. Wrong. And especially wrong when it comes to financial advice—because financial advice by its very nature has to be individual. There\\'s no \"one-size-fits-all\" for anybody. No matter who you are, financial advice should be focused on your specific needs, values and goals. And it should go beyond investing to include budgeting, insurance, estate planning, Social Security—the whole spectrum of your financial life. So where do you get this type of tailored financial advice? From a qualified financial advisor who\\'s willing to listen. Many women prefer a female advisor because they expect to find fewer biases and a greater understanding of their needs. And I personally believe more women should be encouraged to go into the financial advice field. But I would caution both men and women to put aside any gender bias in choosing an advisor. Instead, look for someone with whom you can connect, who has the right combination of professional qualifications and personal qualities to support you. I find every International Women\\'s Day thought-provoking. While the goal is to focus attention on the equality challenges women confront around the world, to me it\\'s more than that. It\\'s a chance for all of us to reflect on our own attitudes and actions that may impact all genders—and to make a personal commitment to confront our own biases and be part of the change that will create a more equitable world for everyone.

       "   'content': 'To reach long-term financial goals, investors should have reasonable expectations for long-term market returns. Overly optimistic expectations could lead to saving too little, because they believe their investments will grow enough to fund their retirement or a child\\'s college education. On the other hand, if return expectations are overly pessimistic they may save too much, at the expense of everyday living and enjoyment. To provide a guide for investors, our analysts at Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, Inc. annually update their long-term return forecasts for stocks and bonds over the coming decade. The latest estimates, summarized in the chart below, cover the period from January 2022 through December 2031. Our current outlook highlights better opportunities in international stocks versus U.S. stocks. Our long-term return estimates have risen from last year\\'s forecasts for several asset classes, including U.S. investment-grade bonds, cash investments, and international large-cap stocks. As such, now may be a good time for investors to review their long-term financial goals to ensure that they are based on projections grounded in disciplined methodology. Historical and projected returns Source: Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, Inc. Historical data from Morningstar Direct. Data as of 12/31/2021. * Published last year.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Our estimates take into account the likelihood of higher interest rates as central banks around the world tighten monetary policy in an effort to rein in rising inflation. Our forecasts incorporate the near-term effects of recent price increases for goods and services as demand has outstripped supply. While long-term inflation is still expected to be far lower than its historical average and current readings, our estimates suggest that the forward-looking 10-year outlook for inflation has risen from our last year\\'s forecast. We find the same pattern with real returns for most investments (i.e., returns after removing the effect of inflation). We project higher 10-year real returns for bonds and international stocks, compared to our forecasts last year. The exception is U.S. stocks—despite robust earnings forecasts, a recent rally (in 2021) in domestic stocks has rendered them somewhat richly valued even at current levels.

We take a forward-looking approach to forecasting returns, rather than basing our estimates on historical averages. Historical averages are less useful, as these only describe past performance. Forward-looking return estimates, however, incorporate expectations for the future, and for this reason we believe they are more useful for making investment decisions or projecting future performance than using historical results. For U.S. and international large-cap stocks, we use analyst earnings estimates and macroeconomic forecast data to estimate two key cash-flow drivers of investment returns: recurring investment income (earnings) and capital gains generated by selling the investment at the end of the forecast horizon of 10 years. To arrive at a return estimate, we answer the question: What returns would investors make if they bought these assets at the current price level to obtain these forecasted future cash flows? For U.S. small-cap stocks, we forecast the returns by analyzing and including the so-called \"size risk premium.\" This is the amount of money that investors in small-capitalization stocks expect to earn over and above the returns on U.S. large-capitalization stocks. For the U.S. investment-grade bonds asset class, which includes Treasuries, investment-grade corporate bonds, and securitized bonds, our forecast takes into account: Yield-to-maturity of a risk-free bond: We believe the future level of return an investor will receive is anchored to a large extent by Treasury yields. Treasury bonds are generally considered to be default risk-free, because they are backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of the U.S. government, and there is a negligible chance that the U.S. government will default on its debt obligations. Roll-down return is an additional source of return that bond fund investors typically earn, as they almost always invest in a bond portfolio that is designed to maintain an average maturity. For example, a roll-down return occurs when a bond fund manager sells a bond whose maturity falls below the average maturity of the portfolio. This process typically results in a gain because yields on bonds with longer maturities are usually higher than on shorter maturities, and because bond prices rise when yields fall. Credit risk premium is the return an investor earns for taking on the risk of potential default, i.e., the possibility that a bond\\'s issuer will be unable to pay its obligations on time, or at all. The lower the issuer\\'s credit rating, the higher the credit risk premium investors typically require for accepting the risk of owning the issuer\\'s debt. Cash investments are very short-term in nature, typically not exceeding three months at a given time, and are reinvested at the end of each period for as long of a horizon as desired. We assume this horizon to be 10 years and estimate the returns from cash investments over this period using a term premium model. Why do you expect long-term returns to be lower than historical averages? Three primary factors are behind the forecast for reduced returns: low interest rates, low economic growth, and equity valuations. Low interest rates. Current and expected interest rates are much lower than what has been experienced historically, especially compared to the high-interest-rate environment of the 1980s. Although our estimates account for a path toward higher rates, they are still not likely to be as high as what we have seen historically. Low economic growth. Economic growth and inflation typically go hand in hand. Strong economic growth historically causes rising inflation, as demand grows faster than supply (we witnessed some of this recently as the economy reopened after COVID-19 shutdowns). Inflation induced by growth is a good thing, as asset returns also tend to increase. At present, while near-term economic growth is likely to be strong, consensus forecasts of economic growth over the long term remain subdued. A robust economy is fundamental to achieving healthy returns from the financial markets. Everything from monetary policy to interest rates and company earnings are linked to this. A measure of economic growth is annual real gross domestic product (GDP) growth. According to consensus forecasts, economists expect 2.3% GDP growth per year, on average, over the next 10 years, even after accounting for expectations of increased economic activity in the near term. This compares to historical average GDP growth of 3.1% per year since 1948. Equity valuations. Valuations appear to be rich especially in the U.S. While earnings are expected to remain robust in the medium term, growth rates have come down from last year. The stock rally in the past year appears to have priced in these earnings expectations. High stock prices today, without a proportionate increase in future earnings, mean lower expected returns going forward. But stocks still tend to have higher expected returns than bonds, albeit with generally higher risks. Why do you expect international stocks to outperform U.S. stocks? As shown in the chart above, we project U.S. large-capitalization stocks to return 6.4% annually over the next 10 years, compared with 7.5% for international large-capitalization stocks. The difference is mainly due to the valuation differences between U.S. stocks compared to international stocks. International stocks are generally more risker than U.S. stocks and investors expect to be compensated for taking on this additional risk. However, we believe that the markets have discounted this risk beyond what fundamentals suggest. Consensus forecasts for earnings growth rate both in the U.S. and abroad are expected to be strong—however, U.S. large-cap stocks (as represented by the S&P 500 index) rose by 27% this year, pricing in this future growth to a far greater extent than similar international stocks (as represented by the MSCI EAFE Index), which rose by only 9%. We recognize that historical returns for stocks overseas have lagged domestic stocks. However, at current levels they have a better chance of outperforming, over the next 10-years, even after accounting for risks. What can investors do now? Thanks to the power of compound returns—that is, the cumulative effect that gains or losses have on an original investment—what investors do (or don\\'t do) today can have a sizeable impact on the likelihood of achieving their long-term investment goals. Our seven investing principles can help you get started and stay on track, but here are a few things to consider now. Establish a financial plan based on your goals. Be realistic about your goals, and be prepared to change your plan as your life circumstances change. Use our updated expected returns to help you be realistic when creating your financial plan. This year most of our expected returns went up, but that doesn\\'t mean you should correspondingly reduce the amount you save. Expected returns fluctuate from year-to-year and are far from a guarantee. The more you save, the more cushion you have in case actual returns don\\'t meet what we expect. Build a diversified portfolio based on your tolerance for risk. Various asset classes—such as stocks, bonds, or cash—behave differently in changing market environments, and it has been nearly impossible to predict which asset classes will perform best in a given year. Instead of chasing past performance, create an appropriately diversified portfolio that can help minimize the effects of market ups and downs.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Would you like to determine your profit potential and exactly how much money you're risking before placing an options trade? If so, credit spreads may be for you. Credit spreads are an options strategy where you simultaneously buy and sell options that are of the: Same class (puts or calls) Same expiration date But with different strike prices Credit spreads have several useful characteristics. As mentioned, they can be a helpful risk-management tool for you. Credit spreads allow you to reduce risk substantially by forgoing a limited amount of profit potential. In most cases, you can calculate the exact amount of money that you’re risking when you enter the position. Credit spreads are also versatile. You can find a combination of contracts to take a bullish or bearish position on a stock by establishing either a: Credit put spread: A bullish position with more premium on the short put Credit call spread: A bearish position with more premium on the short call Let’s discuss each strategy in more detail. Credit put spreads A credit put spread can be used in place of an outright sale of uncovered put options. The sale of an uncovered put option is a bullish trade that can be used when you expect an underlying security or index to move upward. The goal usually is to generate income when the uncovered put option is sold, and then to wait until the option expires worthless. Although the downside risk of uncovered puts is not quite unlimited, it is substantial, because you could lose money until the stock drops all the way to zero. Credit spreads involve the simultaneous purchase and sale of options contracts of the same class (puts or calls) on the same underlying security. In the case of a vertical credit put spread, the expiration month is the same, but the strike price will be different. When you establish a bullish position using a credit put spread, the premium you pay for the option purchased is lower than the premium you receive from the option sold. As a result, you still generate income when the position is established, but less than you would with an uncovered position. Let's look at an example. Credit put spread example: Buy 10 XYZ May 65 puts @ .50 Sell 10 XYZ May 70 puts @ 2 for a net credit of 1.50 This spread is executed for a net credit of $1,500 (2 points premium received – .50 points premium paid x 10 contracts [100 shares per contract]). As shown in the graph below, you will profit if the market price of XYZ closes above $68.50 at expiration. You will maximize your profit ($1,500) at $70 or above. You will lose money if the price of XYZ goes below $68.50, and you could lose up to $3,500 if XYZ closes at $65 or below, at expiration. (Trade fees, taxes, and transaction costs, which are not included in this example, can affect the final outcome and should be considered. For the tax implications involved in these strategies, please speak with a tax advisor.) Credit put spread Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. If you had sold the May 70 puts uncovered, you initially would have brought in $2,000, rather than $1,500. However, the trade-off for reduced $500 profit potential is the ability to limit risk significantly. If you simply sold the May 70 puts uncovered, your loss potential essentially would have been $68,000 ($70,000 loss on the stock, less $2,000 premium received on the sale of the puts) if XYZ were to drop all the way to zero. In the case of this credit spread, your maximum loss cannot exceed $3,500. This maximum loss is the difference between the strike prices on the two options, minus the amount you were credited when the position was established. How credit put spreads work To better understand the profit and loss characteristics of credit put spreads, let's examine five different price scenarios, based on the chart above. We'll assume that once this spread is established, it's held until expiration. (Reminder: trade fees, taxes, and transaction costs are not included in these scenarios.) Scenario 1: The stock drops significantly and closes at $62 on option expiration If this happens, you will exercise your 65 puts, and sell short 1,000 shares of XYZ stock for $65,000. At the same time, your short 70 puts will be assigned, and you will be required to buy back your short position for $70,000 to close. The difference between your buy and sell price is -$5,000. However, because you brought in $1,500 when the spread was established, your net loss is only $3,500. This will be the case at any price below $65. Therefore, this spread is only advantageous over uncovered puts if XYZ drops below $64.50. Scenario 2: The stock drops only slightly and closes at $67 on option expiration If this happens, you won't exercise your 65 puts, because they're out of the money. However, your short 70 puts will be assigned, and you'll be required to buy 1,000 shares of XYZ at a cost of $70,000. You can then sell your shares at the market price of $67, for $67,000. The difference between your buy and sell price results in a loss of $3,000. However, because you brought in $1,500 when the spread was established, your net loss is only $1,500. Your loss will vary from zero to $3,500, at prices from $68.50 down to $65. Scenario 3: The stock closes at exactly $68.50 on option expiration If this happens, you will not exercise your 65 puts, because they're out of the money. However, your short 70 puts will be assigned, and you'll be required to buy 1,000 shares of XYZ at a cost of $70,000. You can then sell your shares at the market price of $68.50, for $68,500. The difference between your buy and sell price results in a loss of $1,500. However, since you brought in $1,500 when the spread was established, your net loss is zero. Scenario 4: The stock rises only slightly and closes at $69 on option expiration If this happens, you won't exercise your 65 puts, because they're out of the money. However, your short 70 puts will be assigned, and you'll be required to buy 1,000 shares of XYZ at a cost of $70,000. You can then sell your shares at the market price of $69 for $69,000. The difference between your buy and sell price results in a loss of $1,000. However, because you brought in $1,500 when the spread was established, your net gain is $500. This gain will vary from zero to $1,500, at prices from $68.50 up to $70. Scenario 5: The stock rises substantially and closes at $72 on option expiration If this happens, you won't exercise your 65 puts, because they are out of the money. Your short 70 puts won't be assigned, because they're out of the money as well. In this case, all the options expire worthless, and no stock is bought or sold. However, because you brought in $1,500 when the spread was established, your net gain is the entire $1,500. This maximum profit of $1,500 will occur at all prices above $70. As you can see from these scenarios, using credit put spreads works to your advantage when you expect the price of XYZ to rise, which will result in a narrowing of the spread price or, ideally, both options expiring worthless. Credit call spreads A credit call spread can be used in place of an outright sale of uncovered call options. The sale of an uncovered call option is a bearish trade that can be used when you expect an underlying security or index to move downward. The goal usually is to generate income when the uncovered call option is sold, and then wait until the option expires worthless. When you establish a bearish position using a credit call spread, the premium you pay for the option purchased is lower than the premium you receive from the option sold. As a result, you still generate income when the position is established, but less than you would with an uncovered position. The mechanics of a credit call spread (a type of vertical spread) are virtually the same as those of a credit put spread, except the profit and loss regions are on opposite sides of the break-even point, as shown below. Let's look at an example. Credit call spread example: Buy 10 XYZ May 80 calls @ .50 Sell 10 XYZ May 75 calls @ 2 for a net credit of 1.50 This spread is executed for a net credit of $1,500 (2 points premium received – .50 points premium paid x 10 contracts [100 shares per contract]). As shown in the graph below, you will profit if the market price of XYZ closes below $76.50 at expiration. You will maximize your profit at or below $75. You will lose money if the price of XYZ goes above $76.50, and you could lose up to $3,500 if XYZ closes at $80 or above at expiration. Credit call spread Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. If you had sold the May 75 calls uncovered, you would have initially brought in $2,000 rather than $1,500. However, the trade-off for reduced $500 profit potential is the ability to limit risk significantly. If you had simply sold the May 75 calls uncovered, your loss potential would have been virtually unlimited if XYZ were to rise substantially. In the case of this credit spread, your maximum loss cannot exceed $3,500. This maximum loss is the difference between the strike prices on the two options, minus the amount you were credited when the position was established. How credit call spreads work As we did with the credit put spread, let's examine five different price scenarios, in light of the chart above, to draw a clearer picture of how a credit call spread can work. We'll assume that once this spread is established, it's held until expiration. Scenario 1: The stock rises significantly and closes at $83 on option expiration If this happens, you will exercise your 80 calls and acquire 1,000 shares of XYZ at a cost of $80,000. At the same time, your short 75 calls will be assigned, and you'll be required to sell 1,000 shares of XYZ for $75,000. The difference between your buy and sell price results in a loss of $5,000. However, you brought in $1,500 when the spread was established, so your net loss is only $3,500. This will be the case at any price above $80. Therefore, this spread is only advantageous over uncovered calls if XYZ rises above $80.50. Scenario 2: The stock rises only slightly and closes at $78 on option expiration If this happens, you won't exercise your 80 calls, because they're out of the money. However, your short 75 calls will be assigned, and you'll be required to sell short 1,000 shares of XYZ for $75,000. You can then close out your short position by purchasing 1,000 shares of XYZ at the market price of $78, at a cost of $78,000. The difference between your buy and sell price results in a loss of $3,000. However, because you brought in $1,500 when the spread was established, your net loss is only $1,500. Your loss will vary from zero to $3,500, at prices from $76.50 up to $80. Scenario 3: The stock closes at exactly $76.50 on option expiration. If this happens, you won't exercise your 80 calls, because they're out of the money. However, your short 75 calls will be assigned, and you will be required to sell short 1,000 shares of XYZ for $75,000. You can then close out your short position by purchasing 1,000 shares of XYZ at a cost of $76,500. The difference between your buy and sell price results in a loss of $1,500. However, because you brought in $1,500 initially when the spread was established, your net loss is zero. Scenario 4: The stock drops only slightly and closes at $76 on option expiration If this happens, you won't exercise your 80 calls, because they're out of the money. However, your short 75 calls will be assigned, and you'll be required to sell short 1,000 shares of XYZ for $75,000. You can then close out your short position by purchasing 1,000 shares of XYZ at a cost of $76,000. The difference between your buy and sell price results in a loss of $1,000. However, because you brought in $1,500 when the spread was established, you have a net gain of $500. This gain will vary from zero to $1,500, at prices from $76.50 down to $75. Scenario 5: The stock drops substantially and closes at $73 on option expiration. If this happens, you won't exercise your 80 calls, because they are out of the money. Your short 75 calls won't be assigned, because they are out of the money as well. In this case, all the options expire worthless, and no stock is bought or sold. However, because you brought in $1,500 when the spread was established, your net gain is the entire $1,500. This maximum profit of $1,500 will occur at all prices below $75. As you can see from these scenarios, using credit call spreads works to your advantage when you expect the price of XYZ to fall, which would result in a narrowing of the spread price or, ideally, both options expiring worthless. Before you consider the sale of uncovered calls or puts, consider the amount of risk you may be taking and how that risk could be significantly reduced by using credit spreads. Advantages and disadvantages of spreads To summarize, credit spreads have both advantages and disadvantages compared to selling uncovered options. Advantages of credit spreads: Spreads can lower your risk substantially if the stock moves dramatically against you. The margin requirement for credit spreads is substantially lower than for uncovered options. It is not possible to lose more money than the margin requirement held in your account at the time the position is established. With uncovered options, you can lose substantially more than the initial margin requirement. Debit and credit spreads may require less monitoring than some other types of strategies because, once established, they're usually held until expiration. However, spreads should be reviewed occasionally to determine if holding them until expiration is still warranted. For example, if the underlying instrument moves far enough and quickly enough, you may be able to close out the spread position at a net profit prior to expiration. Spreads are versatile. Due to the wide range of strike prices and expirations that are typically available, most traders can find a combination of contracts that will allow them to take a bullish or bearish position on a stock. This is true of both debit spreads and credit spreads. Disadvantages of credits spreads: Your profit potential will be reduced by the amount spent on the long option leg of the spread. Because a spread requires two options, the trade fee costs to establish and/or close out a credit spread will be higher than those for a single uncovered position.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Global leaders backed a new round of sanctions on Russia, but it is unclear at this time if these additional measures will be successful at avoiding an energy shock.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Over the weekend, leaders from the U.S., EU, Japan, Canada, and U.K. backed a new round of sanctions on Russia. Like previous actions, they appear to be crafted to exempt energy transactions between Europe and Russia, but it is unclear at this time if these additional measures will be successful at avoiding an energy shock. What is becoming clear? The Russian financial system will likely face substantial stresses. The EU\\'s hardening resolve to embrace these new, tougher sanctions along with NATO arms shipments to Ukraine suggests that the conflict and its costs may continue to grow. In the near-term, these events may drive even more of the market swings we wrote about on Friday in Russia-Ukraine: Navigating Markets on Edge. SWIFT action We wrote on Thursday: \"Should Russian banks be restricted from the SWIFT payment system, making it much harder for Russia to export oil, it may push energy prices higher for the rest of the world at a time when inflation is well above average.\" Although the statement released on Saturday made it clear that only Russian banks already being targeted with prior rounds of sanctions would be removed from SWIFT, the ban could be extended to additional banks, if necessary. It is unclear which banks beyond the five lenders that were named in prior sanctions may be targeted which makes it hard to assess the impact of the partial SWIFT ban. Russia was home to more than 360 banks at the start of this year. We are watching to see if Gazprombank becomes a target since it handles a large share of Russia\\'s energy exports. The sanctions are designed to hurt Russia\\'s economy while minimizing impacts to global energy and agricultural supplies and attempting to avoid a \"stagflationary\" (the combination of high inflation and low growth) shock on the rest of the world. At this time, U.S. and EU leaders are not targeting Russian energy exports and Russia is not threatening to cut off oil and gas shipments in retaliation to these sanctions. Because energy makes up 60% of Russian exports and 30% of its gross domestic product, Russia may be more inclined to reap the windfall from high prices than to deny itself critical revenue at a time when its economy is at risk of recession. If the new sanctions do not severely curtail Russia\\'s ability to sell energy, the risk of major economic disruptions could be reduced. Yet, the more pressure that is applied by expanding sanctions, the greater the risk energy supplies could be cut off by Russia. Of course, the war itself could also result in interruption if gas pipelines that transmit gas to Europe through Ukraine are damaged. Russia\\'s trade relationships Source: Charles Schwab, US Census Bureau, European Commission, Data for 2020 retrieved as of 1/28/2022. There are a potential offsets to any possible energy shortages. The U.S. appears close to a nuclear deal with Iran that would bring much-needed supplies to the market at a critical time. Also, winter is ending in a few weeks, reducing demand for energy to heat homes and businesses. Europe reports that it already has prepared enough natural gas supplies to withstand an immediate shock or supply cutoff. Reserves frozen Russia\\'s central bank and its foreign currency reserves are being targeted to hinder its ability to support the value of Russia\\'s currency, the ruble. Based on data from the Bank of Russia\\'s monthly reports, Russia\\'s available foreign currency reserves may have been cut by as much as one-fifth of what they were on Friday. The sanctions include limiting Russia\\'s ability to draw on its credit lines at the International Monetary Fund or access to its funds at the Bank for International Settlements. However, the released statement was unclear about the extent of the freeze, appearing on the surface to be a limited restriction tied to certain activities. Russian ruble hits new low Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 2/27/2022. The ruble has fallen to new a new low versus the U.S. dollar, making imports more costly and boosting inflation in Russia. Russia has already chosen to impose capital controls, and may limit conversion from rubles into dollars, and even limit daily withdrawals from bank accounts in attempt to prevent further decline of its currency and runaway inflation. These efforts may also further impact the Russian financial system and economy. Related impacts There are other impacts from this weekend\\'s developments that bear watching for investors. Bank failures - The sanctions are likely to push Russia into a recession and may cause overseas subsidiaries of some Russian banks to fail, but these are very likely too small to create a global financial crisis. Supply chain woes - The conflict may have a small impact on already stretched global supply chains. Volkswagen will suspend production at two factories in eastern Germany that make electric vehicles because fighting has interrupted deliveries of critical parts from Ukraine. More defense spending - Germany\\'s government announced it would spend an additional €100 billion, or 3% of GDP, on defense this year and spend at least 2% of GDP per year starting in 2024. This could set the tone for looser fiscal policy from other Eurozone governments, partially offsetting the economic drag from higher energy costs. Moving fast It\\'s not yet clear how impactful the latest round of sanctions will be on energy flows and financial markets or whether they will do much to help ease the violence in Ukraine in the coming days. Last week, President Biden cautioned that it could take weeks or months for the effects of sanctions on Russia to be felt. Yet, new developments regarding the military and financial battles are coming fast. In the near-term, markets are likely to continue the swings seen last week as developments unfold. What is more certain is that Russia\\'s stock market—which accounted for 2% of the MSCI Emerging Market Index at the end of last week (with more than half of that in two energy companies and a bank targeted for sanctions)—is likely to be much smaller this week.

       "   'content': 'The world is watching anxiously as the Russian military moves deeper into Ukraine, expanding an invasion that began Wednesday night. Although the human cost of military action is incalculable, global stock markets in general reacted to the invasion with wide swings before closing modestly lower. This is consistent with their response to previous similar events that we outlined in articles on the conflict published on January 31, February 22, and February 24.

Data retrieved 2/24/2022. *Turkey is a member of NATO, now and at the time of the event. All price performance is in USD. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The potential for global economic disruption from an invasion was most likely to come from sanctions. The chaos on the ground in Ukraine contrasts with the clarity on sanctions. As expected, the United States and the European Union announced a new tougher round of sanctions on Russia on Thursday in response to the invasion, with other major global economies following suit. These sanctions are designed to hurt Russia\\'s economy without affecting global energy and agricultural supplies in a way that could inflict a \"stagflationary\" shock (the combination of high inflation and low growth) on the rest of the world. At this time, U.S. and EU leaders are not targeting Russian energy exports and Russia is not threatening to cut off oil and gas shipments in retaliation to the sanctions. Because energy makes up 60% of Russian exports and 30% of its gross domestic product, Russia may be more inclined to reap the windfall from high prices than to deny itself critical revenue at a time when its economy is at risk of recession. Avoiding impediments to Russia\\'s ability to sell oil significantly weakens the impact of sanctions, but also reduces the risk of major worldwide economic disruptions. This contributed to the muted market reaction. Russia and Ukraine are relatively small countries from an economic and supply chain perspective, excepting a few commodities. By contrast, a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan would involve large economies that play a critical role in a wide variety of global supply chains. Stoking fears early Thursday were reports that nine Chinese military aircraft entered Taiwan airspace, with some suggestion that China was taking advantage of a distracted NATO. However, these overflights happen every day, according to Taiwan\\'s Ministry of Defense, as you can see below.

Investors should not become single-mindedly focused on the conflict in Ukraine and take their eyes off economic indicators. Prior to these recent geopolitical events, the European economy reported a much better-than-expected rebound from the COVID-19 omicron variant. For example, the preliminary reading of the composite purchasing managers index (PMI) climbed to its highest level in six months in February. Although this conflict may contribute to existing inflationary pressure and tighter lending conditions, the potential drag to growth comes at a time when economic momentum was rebounding. U.S. stocks: A sustained oil-price jump could pressure stocks The price of Brent crude oil jumped to more than $100 per barrel on Thursday, and will likely remain elevated while markets assess potential supply disruptions and the availability of alternate oil supplies. Brent crude is produced from the North Sea between the UK and Norway, and is a global oil price benchmark. As you can see below, the spread between Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the U.S. oil benchmark, has spiked, reflecting the invasion\\'s greater impact on global energy prices. The price difference between Brent and WTI oil prices has widened Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 2/24/2022. Although unlikely near-term, the risk of a U.S. recession already existed, given tightening financial conditions and pending Federal Reserve short-term interest rate hikes, which are likely to begin in March. Sustained high energy prices would worsen concerns about slowing economic growth. In terms of the sanctions\\' direct impact of disruptions to Russia\\'s economy, below is a visual from the Atlas of Economic Complexity showing Russia\\'s exports as of 2019.

Colors represent various geographical areas: purple = Europe; red = Asia; blue = North America; yellow = Africa; green = South America; orange = Oceania. On paper, the United States may not directly pay a significant price from sanctions being imposed on Russia, but some investors—particularly hedge funds—could be hurt via their holdings of Russian debt. That said, we are not likely at risk of a repeat of the late-1990s Russian debt default, which led to the spectacular collapse of Long Term Capital Management. Despite the sharp reversal in the market Thursday, stocks probably will remain volatile and subject to headline risk in the weeks to come. What is likely to remain consistent is investors\\' preference for stocks of higher-quality companies, those with factors such as strong free cash flow yield, strong balance sheets, and positive earnings revisions. As central banks begin to tighten monetary policy—now coupled with increased geopolitical uncertainty—we believe the low-quality, highly speculative stocks that performed well early last year will not move back into vogue. Fixed income: Outlook for Fed policy is less certain now Since the news of the Russia-Ukraine conflict hit, the U.S. bond market has been on a roller-coaster ride. Initially, U.S. Treasury bonds rallied as investors sought safe-haven assets. However, the initial drop in yields was largely reversed in the subsequent 24 hours. Ten-year Treasury yields plunged from nearly 2% to as low as 1.82%, before rebounding in the space of two days. Similarly, the market\\'s pricing of the path of Federal Reserve policy has changed very little, despite the heightened uncertainty about the impact of economic sanctions on growth and inflation prospects. Market pricing of steady Fed rate hikes changed very little in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict Source: Bloomberg. Market estimate of the Fed funds using Eurodollar futures (EDSF). As of 2/25/2022. However, we believe that the outlook for Fed policy is far less certain now than prior to the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine. On the one hand, inflation is likely to remain high or move higher due to the shock from the reduced supply of commodities to the global market. Energy and grain prices, which were already rising sharply, could rise even faster, resulting in higher headline inflation—however, given that sanctions so far aren\\'t targeting the energy and agricultural markets, we don\\'t necessarily expect this to happen. However, commodity price shocks often reduce demand and slow growth longer term. In addition, financial conditions have tightened substantially over the past few months as global central banks signaled tighter policies, and risk premia have been rising. In Europe, yield spreads between German and peripheral government bonds have been widening, and domestically, riskier assets have declined in value. If central banks move too rapidly to tighten policy, it could trigger even more tightening in financial conditions. Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions have fallen below zero, indicating tighter lending conditions Source: Bloomberg.

Note: The Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index tracks the overall level of financial stress in the U.S. money, bond, and equity markets to help assess the availability and cost of credit. A positive value indicates accommodative financial conditions, while a negative value indicates tighter financial conditions relative to pre-crisis norms. We still expect the Fed to hike the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the March meeting, barring a major change in the outlook, as inflation remains its primary concern. Longer-term, the Fed will have to weigh the outlook for ongoing high inflation against the potential for slower growth. The result could be a slower path to raising rates than currently anticipated. Intermediate to long-term bond yields are likely to be volatile, reflecting the cross currents in the economic outlook. We still see room for 10-year Treasury yields to rise if tensions ease. However, the path of long-term rates are tied to prospects for long-term growth. Ten-year yield still have room to rise Source: Bloomberg. U.S. Generic 10-year Treasury Yield (USGG10YR INDEX). Daily data as of 2/25/2022. What investors can consider now This week\\'s market reaction to the Ukraine invasion has generally tracked its reaction to prior Russia-related events, i.e., minor changes in market averages and limited economic impact. The takeaway for investors is to avoid getting caught up in dramatic events as they unfold, as it rarely leads to wise decisions. While staying the course and continuing to invest even when markets dip may be hard on your nerves, it can be healthier for your portfolio and can result in greater accumulated wealth over time. These periods of volatility are also reminders of the benefits of the tried-and-true disciplines around diversification (across and within asset classes, including U.S. stocks, international stocks and high-quality bonds) and periodic rebalancing—all tied to each investor\\'s long-term strategic asset allocation strategy. Over time, assets that have gained in value will account for more of your portfolio, while those that have declined will account for less. Rebalancing means selling positions that have become overweight in relation to the rest of your portfolio, and moving the proceeds to positions that have become underweight. It\\'s a good idea to do this at regular intervals.

       "   'content': \"Like Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) allow you to set aside funds to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses. HSA-qualified expenses include co-insurance, deductibles, dental and vision care, prescriptions, and many other health-related items. Unlike FSAs, HSAs can help those in eligible high-deductible health plans1 (HDHPs) sock away triple-tax-free money for qualified medical expenses in retirement. Here's how: Contributions to HSAs are tax-deductible.2 Capital gains, dividends and interest accumulate tax-free.3 You pay no tax on withdrawals for qualified medical expenses. Other notable advantages of an HSA are that it's yours to keep indefinitely (though you can no longer contribute once you've enrolled in Medicare or if you're not covered by an HDHP), and any unspent money remains in your HSA until you use it. With an FSA, if you change employers you lose the account and forfeit any unspent money in your FSA at the end of your employment. Unspent money in your FSA doesn't rollover to the new year, either—if you don't spend the money by the end of the year, you forfeit it. And here's the clincher: If you use HSA funds on non-medical expenses before age 65, you pay both ordinary income tax and a 20% penalty. However, if you use HSA funds for non-medical expenses after age 65, you pay only ordinary income tax. In other words, you'd take no worse a tax hit than you would with an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). The bottom line Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are a highly effective tax-advantaged strategy for medical expenses in retirement. 1 Defined as those with a minimum annual deductible of $1,400 for individuals and $2,800 for families and maximum out of pocket amounts of $7,050 for individuals and $14,100 for families. Enrollees can't be enrolled in Medicare, claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return or covered by another health plan without a high deductible. 2 While HSA contributions are exempt from federal income tax, they are not exempt from state taxes in Alabama, California, New Jersey, and Wisconsin. 3 State taxes may vary.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Preferred securities’ higher yields may be appealing, but they almost always come with additional risks.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Preferred securities are a type of investment that generally offers higher yields than traditional fixed income securities, such as U.S. Treasury securities or investment-grade corporate bonds. However, the higher yields come with different risks. Preferred securities are sometimes considered by investors seeking higher income. They were also one of the hardest-hit investments during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and in the early stages of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. What should you be aware of now to decide whether preferred securities might be the right investment for you for a more-aggressive part of your income portfolio? What are preferred securities? Preferred securities are \"hybrid\" investments, sharing characteristics of both stocks and bonds. In fact, there are many types of preferred securities, each with their own set of characteristics or guarantees. Lately, the term \"preferred security\" has been used as a blanket term for an investment with a par value of $25, but they can rank as high as a senior bond or as low as traditional preferred stock.1 Bond-like characteristics: Fixed par value This is the value for which a preferred can be redeemed by the issuer. Preferred securities often have par values of $25, making it relatively easy for individual investors to invest in given the smaller denomination compared to the $1,000 par value for most corporate bonds. There are preferred securities issued in $1,000 denominations, however, but they tend to be targeted towards institutional investors. While preferreds have fixed par values, their prices still fluctuate in the secondary market. Regular income payments Preferreds generally make quarterly income payments, while traditional bonds usually make semiannual payments. Income payments can be either dividend income or interest income, and can be discretionary or non-discretionary, depending on the structure of the preferred. Credit ratings Many (but not all) preferreds are rated by agencies like Standard & Poor\\'s or Moody\\'s Investors Services. Maturity date This is a nuanced characteristic but tends to lean more on the \"bond\" side of the equation. Preferred securities generally have long maturity dates—like 30 years or longer—or no maturity date at all, meaning they are perpetual in nature. However, most preferreds have a stated \"call date\" that the issuer may choose to redeem them, usually at the par value. Preferreds usually have \"extraordinary\" call features as well, allowing the issuer to redeem the securities for events like a change in the tax regime or capital regulations, but those types of calls are rare. There are a number of reasons why an issuer may call a preferred, but a common rationale is the current level of interest rates. If interest rates have fallen and an issuer can issue a new preferred with a lower coupon rate, it might consider calling in an existing preferred to save on borrowing costs. Stock-like characteristics: Low ranking Most preferred securities rank below traditional debt in the issuer\\'s capital structure. In bankruptcy, for example, corporate bond owners are generally paid before holders of preferred securities. Preferreds can rank as high as traditional senior unsecured bonds and rank above common stock Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research and Standard and Poor\\'s. Weaker obligations to pay income Since they rank low in the capital structure, preferred securities generally don\\'t provide the same guarantees of income payments or payment at maturity as bonds. Income payments on preferred securities are often discretionary, like a traditional stock dividend. A missed interest payment on a bond usually triggers a default, but that\\'s not the case with many preferred securities. Deferrals of payments don\\'t happen often—partly because a deferral would likely limit the appeal to investors, but also because a company isn\\'t permitted to pay dividends on common stock while deferring payments on any outstanding preferred securities. In other words, payments on preferred securities must come before payments to common stock; hence the name \"preferred.\" Exchange-traded Many (but not all) preferreds trade on an exchange, just like traditional stocks. There is one additional characteristic that can fall under either stocks or bonds: tax treatment. Depending on the structure of the preferred, which we discuss below, the income payments can either be taxed as qualified dividends or taxed as interest income. Preferreds tend to offer higher yields than traditional bonds due to these complex characteristics. Since they rank below traditional bonds, have very long maturities, and don\\'t enjoy the same income payment priority as traditional bonds, investors tend to demand higher yields to compensate for those risks. Types of preferred securities There are several varieties of preferred securities and the terms used to describe them can be complex. Here are the primary types, beginning with those that rank lowest in the issuer\\'s capital structure: Preferred stock can be considered the most \"traditional\" type of preferred security, representing ownership in the issuing company. Unlike an issuer\\'s common stock, preferred stock has a fixed par value. Dividends may be suspended at any time and are generally not cumulative, meaning they don\\'t need to be paid back if they are deferred. As equity securities, the coupon payments of some of these preferreds may receive advantageous tax treatment, such as eligibility for qualified dividend income treatment. This is one reason many individual investors historically have chosen preferred stock; however, it\\'s important to read the prospectus to understand whether the payments on any shares that you own are taxed at the qualified rate. Hybrid preferred securities are next in line. In the firm\\'s priority-of-payment ranking, hybrid preferreds generally rank below the issuer\\'s senior unsecured debt, but above preferred stock. Examples of hybrids include capital trust securities and junior subordinated debentures. The interest payments can be deferred and can be either cumulative or non-cumulative. If payments are deferred for cumulative preferred shares, the coupons accumulate and must be paid back later, short of bankruptcy or default. This adds a bit of extra protection for investors, as well as incentive for the issuing companies to keep making payments, since they know they\\'ll have to pay them eventually. \"Non-cumulative\" means that if payments are deferred, they don\\'t accumulate and won\\'t be paid back later. This is a particularly unattractive feature, warranting higher yields for investors. Also keep in mind that deferred payments from hybrid preferreds can generate a \"phantom\" income tax, which makes the holder liable for income not yet received. Hybrid preferreds tend to pay interest, not dividends. They usually have fixed (though generally long) maturity dates compared to preferred stock, which is perpetual by nature. The income payments from hybrid preferreds tend to be taxed as interest income. Baby bonds, or senior notes, are just that: senior unsecured obligations of the issuer. Like bonds, they pay interest, and any missed payments constitute a default. Unlike bonds, they usually have a par value of $25 instead of $1,000, and they usually trade on an exchange. Just like income payments from a traditional corporate bond, the income payments from baby bonds are generally taxed as interest income. Typical preferred security structures Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Why do companies issue preferred securities? Companies generally issue preferred securities for flexibility. The primary issuers tend to be financial firms, such as banks or real estate companies, which need easy access to debt markets to operate. But other companies, such as utilities and industrial companies, often issue preferred securities as well. Preferred securities provide these companies with flexibility as an extra financing tool in addition to common stock and more-traditional corporate bonds. Banks, which have strict regulatory requirements, are also able to use preferred securities as a source of capital \"cushion\" between their bonds and common stock. Bank regulations require certain levels of capital reserves, and preferreds can help meet that objective. The degree of capital treatment varies depending on the type of preferred security. Preferreds do come with additional risks Higher yields may be appealing, but they almost always come with the additional risks described below. However, lower yields that other investments offer can also be risky—in terms of maintaining purchasing power, meeting living expenses and so on. So there are tradeoffs. Which risks are most important to you? Risk of large drawdowns This doesn\\'t necessarily happen often, but preferred prices can fall sharply if market conditions deteriorate. That happened during the global financial crisis in 2008 and then again in the first few months of 2020 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher yields come with greater risks Source: Bloomberg, as of January 31, 2022. Worst rolling 12-month total returns are from 12/31/99 to 1/31/22 using monthly data. Indexes used are the Bloomberg U.S. Treasuries Index (LUATTRUU Index), Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index (LMBITR Index), Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (LBUSTRUU Index), Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index (LUACTRUU Index), ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index (P0P1 Index), and the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index (LF98TRUU Index). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Fewer diversification benefits than traditional bonds High-quality bonds, like U.S. Treasuries, tend to have a low or negative correlation with stocks, so adding Treasuries to a portfolio can provide diversification benefits, helping limit volatility.2 That\\'s not the case with preferreds. Preferreds generally have a stronger relationship with the stock market than the bond market. That can be good when stocks are rising, but it can hurt portfolios if stock indexes are falling. This is important when building a well-diversified portfolio because preferred securities don\\'t offer the same diversification benefits that highly rated bond investments can provide. Sector concentration in banks and finance companies If you buy individual preferreds, this can lead to inadvertently concentrating your portfolio in specific financial firms as well as in the financial sector as a whole. When investing with individual preferred securities, we suggest limiting exposure to any single issuer to no more than 10% of your portfolio. Lower credit ratings than the issuer\\'s bonds An issuer\\'s preferred securities will usually have a lower rating than the firm\\'s senior, unsecured bonds. Also, preferred securities are often compared to sub-investment grade, or high-yield, bonds, given the higher income opportunities. But remember, high-yield bonds, by definition, carry speculative-grade ratings, so they do come with credit risk. Investors who research carefully can still find preferred shares from investment-grade companies, thus providing higher credit quality than junk bonds. Many preferred securities these days, however, are rated \"BBB\" (the lowest rung of the investment grade spectrum) or \"BB\" (the highest rung of the sub-investment grade spectrum.) High interest rate risk Since preferred securities have long maturities, or no maturities at all, they tend to have high interest rate risk, or the risk that prices will fall when yields rise. Given that, preferreds should always be considered long-term investments since fluctuating interest rates can have outsized effects on preferred security prices. Overall, investors with higher appetites for credit risk may consider allocating up to 20% of their overall portfolio to more aggressive income investments. Along with preferred securities, that could include high-yield bonds, bank loans, or emerging market bonds. Again, preferred securities may not be appropriate for all investors. Those who do choose them should learn about some of the risks and use them strategically as a higher-risk part of their income portfolio. Find out more about individual preferred securities Finding good information about preferred securities can be difficult, and there are many details to understand before investing. The best source of information will always be a security\\'s prospectus, which you can obtain from a Schwab fixed income specialist, or from data repositories available online. Schwab clients can access our Preferred Stock Screener. Don\\'t just screen for the highest yields—also screen based on attributes such as credit rating, and then augment it with more information about the issuing company, the security listed, specific characteristics of the preferred shares (whether they coupon payments are cumulative or non-cumulative, for example, which is often listed in the security description) as well as call dates and other details. Don\\'t just look at the issue\\'s current yield—if a preferred is priced above par, it\\'s important to find out its yield-to-call. A preferred with a price above its $25 par value that has an upcoming call date may result in a negative total return if it\\'s redeemed at that call date. A fixed income specialist can help identify that yield. If you\\'d like a diversified solution without too much exposure to any single preferred stock or issuer, consider preferred-stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds. Clients can search for \"preferred stock\" funds in the \"taxable bond\" category using the Schwab ETF Screener or the Schwab Mutual Fund Screener. Clients can also consider a separately managed account for an allocation to preferred securities, but keep in mind that they have higher investment minimums than ETFs or mutual funds. 1 Par value, also known as face value, is the amount the issuer promises to pay the bondholder when the bond matures. 2 Correlation is a statistical measure of how two investments have historically moved in relation to each other, and ranges from -1 to +1. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, while a correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation. A correlation of zero means the assets are not correlated.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, When I did my taxes last year, I wound up owing a lot to the IRS. A friend at work mentioned she got a huge refund. Can I do something to get a refund too? —A Reader Dear Reader, Tax season always brings a host of questions from readers. Mostly they boil down to \"How can I pay less in taxes?\" or \"How can I get a bigger refund?\" But these are two very different questions. Here\\'s why. Tax refunds vs. how much you pay Getting a refund doesn\\'t mean you\\'re paying less in taxes. A tax refund simply means you had too much withheld and, in effect, gave the government a zero-interest loan the prior year. In the same way, if you have to pay taxes when filing, it doesn\\'t mean you\\'re paying more. It just means you had less withheld than you owed the prior year. So rather than focusing on a refund, your main focus should be on your total tax bill and what you can do to potentially reduce the taxes you pay. Here are some suggestions. Check your withholding To make sure you\\'re not over or under paying, check to see if the right amount of taxes is being withheld from your income. You can do this with the IRS\\'s Tax Withholding Estimator. It\\'s important not to under withhold by too much as that can trigger a penalty as well as interest. Be sure to account for bonuses, investment income, and other income sources like rental income to ensure you\\'re withholding the right amount. If you don\\'t have taxes withheld, for instance if you\\'re self-employed, an independent contractor, or have significant income from sources other than wages, you should be making quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS to avoid penalties and interest. Understand deductions Deductions reduce the amount of income subject to tax. For some filers, itemizing deductions such as mortgage interest makes sense. But because of recent increases in the standard deduction ($12,550 for single taxpayers; $25,100 for married filing jointly for 2021), it\\'s more practical for most filers to take the standard deduction rather than itemizing. (Good news for student loan borrowers: A portion of your interest on student loans can be deductible without itemizing.) But whether or not you itemize, deductions aren\\'t the only way to get a tax break. Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged savings accounts One surefire way to lower your tax bill is to contribute to tax-advantaged accounts. For instance, tax-deductible contributions to traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b), and 457(b) accounts can reduce your taxable income dollar for dollar. Roth IRA and Roth 401(k) contributions don’t provide a tax deduction upfront, but still provide tax-deferred growth and the potential for tax-free earnings for qualified distributions after age 59½. If you have access to a Health Savings Account (HSA), you get the advantage of 100% deductible contributions, tax-deferral, and tax-free distributions for qualified healthcare expenses now and in the future. This can be a great tax move. Plus, individuals 50 and older can make annual \"catch up\" contributions of $1,000 to an IRA and $6,500 to 401(k)/403(b)/457(b) plans. Individuals 55 and older can make $1,000 annual catch up contributions to an HSA. Other tax-advantaged accounts like 529 College Savings Plans and Flexible Savings Accounts can also help you save on taxes while saving for other goals. Get (tax) credits Tax credits can be even more valuable than tax deductions because they offset what you may owe in taxes dollar-for-dollar. There is a wide range of tax credits available to all types of taxpayers. Some credits may not apply to you or may be phased out based on your filing status or income, but it\\'s worth your time to do some research. Here\\'s a list of just a handful of important (but often overlooked!) tax credits: Earned Income Tax Credit—This is a tax break for lower-income families with children. The average amount of EITC received nationwide was about $2,400 in 2020. Child Tax Credit—Expanded by the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), this credit is up to $3,000 per child for children 6 through 17 and up to $3,600 for children under 6. Child and Dependent Care Credit—Also expanded for 2021 by ARPA, this credit is up to $4,000 for each qualifying child or dependent or $8,000 for two or more. Retirement Saver’s Credit—Up to $1,000 ($2,000 for joint filers) in government \"matching funds\" helps low earners save more in a 401(k), 529 ABLE or IRA. American Opportunity Credit (AOTC) and Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC)—Designed to help with the cost of higher education, the AOTC is up to $2,500 per eligible student; the LLC is up to $2,000 per tax return. You can claim both AOTC and LLC credits on the same return—but not for the same student or the same qualified expenses. Premium Tax Credit (Affordable Care Act)—If you purchase health insurance through one of the exchanges created by the ACA, you may qualify for this tax credit to lower health insurance costs. Residential Energy Credit—If you\\'re a homeowner who invested in solar panels or other energy efficient upgrades to your home, you may qualify for a credit equal to a percentage of the upgrade\\'s cost. Consider these strategies Besides the opportunities discussed above, the following strategies may also help lower your taxes: Bunching deductions—Certain deductions like charitable contributions and medical expenses are permitted if you itemize them. By \"bunching deductions\" in a particular year, rather than spreading them over multiple years, you may increase the likelihood of being able to itemize these costs. Tax loss harvesting—If you have investments in taxable accounts that have lost money, you may be able to use those losses to offset capital gains. Plus, you can deduct up to $3,000 of any remaining losses to offset ordinary income each year—and carry additional losses into future years. Gifting—Giving appreciated stock or income-producing assets to charities or individuals in a lower tax bracket may save on taxes and allow you to gift more. As good as a tax refund may feel in the moment, that\\'s not a sign you paid less overall. Instead of focusing on a refund, take the time to do some planning, making the most of tax-advantaged accounts as well as deductions and credits. Talk with a tax advisor for more specific advice and details. And once you\\'ve planned your strategy, consider E-filing for a quicker response from the IRS. Have a personal finance question?

In support, Russia ordered \"peacekeeping\" troops to the areas, prompting sanctions by world powers. This was a risk we cited in our Top Global Risks of 2022 published late last year and elaborated on in January\\'s Guide to Geopolitical Risk: Russia-Ukraine. We wrote that the market response may be muted and cautioned investors against overreacting in their portfolios. In textbook fashion, stocks declined modestly—about 1%—in the U.S., Europe and emerging markets on Tuesday. Sanctions announced so far by Germany, the U.K. and the U.S., have been as expected and are likely to have a limited impact on the global economy and inflation. Russia seems to be bearing the brunt of the costs of its actions. These events are not likely to impact central bank policies—a key driver of markets this year—unless energy prices spike and exacerbate inflation pressures or economic momentum slows due to uncertainty around further developments. A history of mild market reactions While Russian military confrontations can be unsettling, markets tend to take them in stride, as the impact on global economic and earnings growth tends to be small. Prior Russian geopolitical events include: August 8, 2008: Russia accused Georgia of attacking pro-Russian separatists and launched an invasion of Georgia, which Russia called a \"peace enforcement\" operation, recognizing the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia. Stocks ended higher that day in the U.S., international developed and emerging markets. August 3, 2014: Unmarked Russian troops invaded Ukraine to support pro-Russia separatists and annex Crimea. The Russian air force engaged NATO members as the U.S. and allies began military exercises on Russia\\'s border. Stocks fell less than 2% that day in the U.S., international developed and emerging markets. They shortly began to rebound from those losses.

All price performance is in USD. *Turkey is a member of NATO, now and at the time of the event. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This mild market reaction to geopolitical events is not limited to those involving Russia. A long history of geopolitical developments has seen a similarly muted reaction in markets. Sanctions impacts Sanctions announced have been limited in scope, leaving room for more if additional actions warrant: Germany: Chancellor Scholz announced on Tuesday that he would continue to delay approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of natural gas to Germany (construction was finished in September). German regulators have yet to issue the final legal permission Russia needs to begin operations. Natural gas prices in Europe rose on Tuesday but remain well below recent highs. Some countries in Europe have preemptively placed a cap on consumer prices for gas this winter so consumers might not feel any further rise immediately. European natural gas prices for March delivery well off December highs Sourtce: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 2/22/2022. U.K.: Prime Minister Johnson announced sanctions on five Russian banks (Rossiya, IS Bank, General Bank, Promsvyazbank, and Black Sea Bank) and three Russian oligarchs (Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg). These are likely to have a very limited impact on the U.K. economy or inflation. U.S.: Thus far, a U.S. executive order by President Biden bans investment, trade and financing by U.S. entities in Donetsk and Luhansk and will prohibit American financial institutions from processing transactions for Russian bank VEB and its military bank. The U.S. also maintains sanctions from past events. The 2014 sanctions imposed by the Obama administration on Russia, after its invasion of Crimea, remain in effect. Additional sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election remain in place. And further sanctions were applied by the Biden administration in 2021 after the SolarWinds cyberattack, which exposed data from both the U.S. government as well as hundreds of American companies. Any further sanctions imposed are unlikely to have meaningful economic impact on the U.S., due to limited economic exposure. Were the U.S. to follow through on its threat to restrict Russian banks from the SWIFT global payments network, it would be much harder for Russia to export oil. This would hurt Russia\\'s main source of direct revenue but may also risk pushing energy prices higher for the rest of the world at a time when inflation is well above average. A U.S.-led nuclear deal with Iran in the next few weeks could come at a critical time to offset an oil supply crunch. In normal times, central banks tend to look past an energy-led rise in inflation. But with the current elevated pace of inflation, and the potential for a further rise in energy prices to stoke higher inflation expectations, it\\'s possible policymakers may feel more pressure to raise interest rates. The potential stock market impact of an energy shock in Europe is difficult to assess from historical data. Whenever the European Union\\'s energy component of the consumer price index (CPI) exceeded a 10% year-over-year gain (which is approximately one standard deviation above the 25-year average), the impact on European stocks (measured in euros) was mixed. Energy price spikes in Europe and stock market performance Energy price spikes in Europe and stock market performance Begin Spike End Spike MSCI EU Price Performance (USD) MSCI EU Price Performance (Euro) 12/1/1999 12/1/2000 -1.9% 5.2% 4/1/2005 6/1/2006 18.0% 20.3% 1/1/2008 9/1/2008 -33.6% -29.1% 12/1/2010 11/1/2011 -5.8% -8.1% 4/1/2021 1.8% 6.9% Source Charles Schwab, Data from Factset as of 2/2/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. But this historical data may not be useful since: the spike in 1999 preceded the unrelated dot-com recession and bear market, the 2008 price spike preceded the unrelated global financial crisis, and the 2011 price spike preceded the unrelated European debt crisis. This makes it hard to say what the impact of these prices spikes on the market would have been had unrelated recessions and bear markets not taken place shortly thereafter. But, perhaps most importantly, one exception to these examples occurred in 2005–2006 when there was no recession or financial crisis, the Fed was hiking rates, and Russia was in a long-running conflict in Chechnya. This is in some ways similar to the current environment. This period was the most positive for the market, with double-digit gains. Russia bearing the brunt Russia\\'s stock market usually trades in sync with oil prices. But recently, as oil hits new highs, Russian stocks have fallen into a bear market. What could have been a 20% rally in Russian stocks has turned into a 40% crash due to geopolitical tensions. Stocks and oil prices Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 2/22/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. To put these moves in perspective, Russia has very small equity exposure in the global indexes, making up only 3% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and just 0.4% of the global stock market as measured by the MSCI AC World Index. Russia may see a recession as a result of its own actions. The ruble, Russia\\'s currency, has plunged, making Russia\\'s imports more expensive. With the U.S. leading a renewed Iranian nuclear deal in the next few weeks, an oil supply crunch could be avoided, prices may stabilize, and market share could be taken from Russia, worsening its export picture. Takeaway We don\\'t believe that diversified investors need to take actions to protect portfolios from the market risks tied to events in Ukraine, with market and economic trends unlikely to be significantly altered.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Excuse this longer-than-usual report, but consider it an \"encyclopedia\" of sorts associated with the important shift underway in monetary policy. Market volatility this year so far has both longer-term and shorter-term drivers, including the pending Federal Reserve tightening cycle and the Russia/Ukraine uncertainty, respectively. Although the Russia/Ukraine situation could influence expectations around U.S. and global growth via the energy price channels, it likely won\\'t lead to the Fed veering off its present course to begin raising interest rates, shrinking its balance sheet, and putting pressure on aggregate demand in order to rein in elevated inflation. The $9 trillion question Unlike in advance of (or during) some past tightening cycles, the Fed is not operating with a pre-determined policy playbook. That said, Fed speakers—including Chair Pro-Tempore Jerome Powell—have a keen understanding of the power of their words, which have contributed to the tightening of financial conditions already underway. What makes this cycle particularly unique—aside from the implications of the pandemic—is that the Fed plans to embark on a tightening cycle via raising the fed funds rate, while also planning to shrink a $9 trillion balance sheet. The dual levers the Fed plans to pull separate this cycle from those in the past; however, a look at history can still be instructive. Many thanks are in order for our friends and research partners at Ned Davis Research (NDR), who have a vast database associated with Fed tightening cycles all the way back to WWII. We worked with them in creating most of the charts below and are grateful for their collaboration. Before getting into our \"chartfest\" below, let\\'s start with a background table highlighting that rate hike cycles do not always lead to recessions. There were \"soft landings\" following the 1963, 1994 and 2015 cycles, while those that were followed by recessions had wide variability in terms of lead time. Source: Charles Schwab, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Chart background details Some background is in order before getting to the meat on the bone of the charts below. There are three types of rate hike cycles: slow, fast and \"non.\" Slow cycles are when the Fed was raising rates over a span of time, but also taking its time by not hiking during consecutive months or Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. Conversely, fast cycles—like between 2004 and 2007—were when the Fed was raising rates during consecutive months or FOMC meetings. Finally, \"non cycles\" where periods when the Fed began raising rates but had to stop after one or two (for myriad reasons). Most of the charts below, unless otherwise indicated, only incorporate the slow and fast cycles, not the non cycles. Finally, we added in lines for the current lead-in to the initial rate hike, which we are assuming will be announced on March 16, following the two-day FOMC meeting. However, on the charts that have monthly data readings, the start point for the coming cycle is labeled with March 31, 2022. Stock market during rate hike cycles Let\\'s start with a version of a chart I put in our 2022 outlook report late last year. The chart below (as well as all others that have three sections) covers the one-year lead-in to the initial rate hike (left field), the first year following the initial rate hike (middle field), and the second year following the initial rate hike (right field). The green line is the current experience, which just extends as a static line thereafter—even though we know that will not be the case. As shown below, in terms of the S&P 500\\'s performance during the current lead-in in terms of the initial hike in March has been significantly stronger than the average of prior cycles, including both slow and fast cycles. As you can see, although fast and slow cycles historically had similar performance during the lead-in period, it was in the aftermath of the initial hike that a major divergence began. As shown at the top of the middle field, the S&P 500\\'s average performance during slow cycles was +10.5%, while during fast cycles it was -2.7%. Interestingly, in the second year, performance flipped, with the S&P 500 performing better during fast cycles. Earnings/valuations during rate hike cycles Earnings and valuations are key drivers of stock market returns, with some interesting trends occurring during past rate hike cycles. As shown below, the current cycle looks nothing like prior cycles—with the pandemic causing an unprecedented surge in earnings following the equally unprecedented plunge the prior year. Historically, the lead-in to fast cycles, as well as during the first year of rate hikes, were characterized by much stronger earnings growth (top of left and middle fields); while that reversed once year two was underway (top of right field). Due to the slowdown in earnings growth underway, clearly shown above, the start of the coming rate hike cycle comes at a unique time. In terms of valuation, a March initial rate hike would correspond to the second-highest S&P 500 P/E ratio in history. Indeed, the P/E has been coming down thanks to the surge in the denominator (E), but remains historically-elevated. Key ratios during rate hike cycles Historically, small cap stocks have been mixed vs. large cap stocks around the first rate hike. As shown in the chart below, during the lead-in so far in the current cycle, the Russell 2000/1000 ratio ranks as the worst performance in history for small caps. One year after the initial rate hike, small caps outperformed only 50% of the time (see table within first chart), implying that other factors drive small/large performance. We believe high-quality small cap stocks have runway for outperformance this year; but the emphasis is on high quality (more on that below). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. As shown in the chart below, stocks outperformed bonds in the year leading up to the initial rate hike, with the stock/bond ratio rising in six out of seven cases. The lead-in during this cycle has been even stronger for this ratio, as shown by the dotted line. Stocks did tend to outperform during the first year of the hiking cycle, but by a smaller amount—and with much more volatility. We continue to expect heightened volatility for both stocks and bonds this year. Finally, as shown in the chart below, a more decisive shift was historically seen from low-quality to high-quality stocks once rate hikes began. Caveat: The 1999 outlier skews the average line shown in the chart, which included the largest gain for low quality relative to high quality—but also the largest subsequent drawdown in the year following the initial rate hike. We continue to emphasize high quality in terms of where we believe leadership will persist this year. Economic trends during rate hike cycles The Coincident Economic Index (CEI) is a monthly release that comes alongside the Leading Economic Index (LEI) courtesy of The Conference Board. The CEI is a monthly proxy for broad economic growth and is a more-timely indicator than quarterly gross domestic product (GDP). As shown below, based on past cycles, economic growth did not slow significantly at the start of tightening; however, fast cycles hit growth more than slow cycles once rate hikes were underway (see top of middle and right fields). A clear difference between the current cycle and past cycles is the very low level of the unemployment rate heading into the initial rate hike (red dotted line in the chart below). The unemployment rate fell during the first year of rate hikes in all but one prior cycle—1980, which was associated with the second leg of the 1980-1982 double-dip recession. We don\\'t expect this coming tightening cycle to dramatically slow job growth, but there is also much less room for improvement given how low the unemployment rate is today. Inflation is obviously top of mind in this cycle. As shown below, the past year\\'s pace of the consumer price index (CPI) has been the highest since the early 1960s (red dotted line vs. lime-green line). Historically, the Fed\\'s record on inflation is mixed-to-positive; although both 1970s\\' cycles saw inflation continuing to accelerate during the two years following the initial rate hike. We continue to expect inflation to ease as the year progresses, with key leading indicators already pointing in that direction. Many of the factors that contributed to last year\\'s initial surge in inflation are fading or reversing—including the pandemic (hope springs eternal), fiscal and monetary stimulus, supply chain bottlenecks, and consumers’ goods-oriented demand. A balancing act As noted at the beginning of this report, much of the unique nature of the current environment and coming Fed tightening cycle is attributed to the central bank\\'s balance sheet—both its relatively new existence as a policy tool and massive size. Quantitative easing (QE), the Fed\\'s large-scale purchases of assets, has become a feature (in phases) of the post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) era, as shown by the shaded segments in the chart below. QE era ending Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 2/16/2022. The Fed balance sheet is the U.S. Federal Reserve System\\'s balance sheet of assets and liabilities. Operation Twist is a monetary policy strategy used by central banks aimed at stimulating economic growth through lowering long-term interest rates which effectively \"twists\" the ends of the yield curve where short-term yields go up and long-term interest rates drop simultaneously. On the QT Only in one tightening cycle (that which preceded the pandemic) has the Fed dealt with the dual levers of adjusting interest rates and the size of its balance sheet. When the idea of shrinking the balance sheet was broached in the mid-2010s, and eventually enacted in 2018, the Fed opted for a runoff strategy—allowing a certain number of bonds to mature each month without the repaid principal being reinvested in new securities—as opposed to the outright active selling of securities being explored today. In what became known as quantitative tightening (QT), the runoff lasted until September 2019, during which a rupture occurred in short-term credit markets, causing a spike in borrowing rates and the Fed to reverse course. Not long after, with the arrival of the pandemic, the size of the balance sheet swelled beyond its prior peak; and as of mid-February, stood at nearly $9 trillion. Fed officials have not been shy in their desire to enact QT at a faster pace this time around—a marked shift from the prior tightening cycle when interest rate increases occurred well before a reduction in the balance sheet. With active selling of securities now a clear and likely path, there is potential for a double-barreled tightening impact. In fact, some economists and strategists have estimated that a $500-$600 billion reduction in the balance sheet may equate to a 25 basis-points hike in the fed funds rate. Should that manifest, it may lend credence to the notion that the Fed can manage to hike interest rates in a less aggressive fashion this year—both in terms of magnitude and pace. \"Fed put\" getting put to bed? The Fed\\'s balance sheet has become a major subject of debate in terms of its potential impact on the stock market. Critics have argued that the central bank has only engaged in QE to save the stock market from intense drawdowns, while defenders point to the brief period in which QE has existed—thus rendering historical analyses and correlations unreliable. With the current era of easing set to come to an end in short order amid a weakening stock market, geopolitical turmoil, and building concerns over a slowing economy, some investors have posited that the Fed won’t be able to engage in rate hikes or QT for very long. In other words, a belief in the \"Fed put\"—a hypothetical level for the stock market (or volatility) at which the Fed must step in to arrest a correction or bear market—is back in vogue. We believe it\\'s potentially hazardous to subscribe to the view that the Fed will halt its policy normalization strictly due to stock market volatility. This has been made clear by none other than Fed Chair Pro-Tempore Jerome Powell himself. In his remarks to the Economic Club of New York on November 28th, 2018 (Liz Ann was in attendance), he stated: \"It is important to distinguish between market volatility and events that threaten financial stability. Large, sustained declines in equity prices can put downward pressure on spending and confidence. From the financial stability perspective, however, today we do not see dangerous excesses in the stock market.\" Keen observers will note Powell\\'s emphasis on the separation of financial stability—which doesn’t currently appear to be at risk—and market volatility. While we have had no shortage of volatility this year, that in and of itself is not sufficient evidence to suggest that the broader financial system is weak, and thus is not supportive of the Fed reversing course on its commitment to tighten policy. We are perhaps currently living out that truth today, with weakness spreading throughout several areas of the market and stability not yet threatened. That may very well assist the Fed in its goal to rein inflation in and tighten financial conditions. Equities have never been more \"important\" to economy The current bull market has ushered in substantial gains for equity investors, which has coincided with record flows into equity ETFs (2021 in fact saw more inflows than the prior three years combined), thus boosting asset holders\\' equity exposure and sending household stock allocations back near their all-time high. The rub with that, as shown in the chart below, is the relatively close historical relationship between stock exposure and the subsequent rolling 10-year total return for the S&P 500. Indeed, it remains in what has been the weakest zone for the market\\'s forward returns historically.

Equity allocation (includes mutual funds and pension funds) is % of total equites, bonds and cash. The consequence of the elevated weight of equities in household portfolios is that a protracted and intense drawdown in the market presents a threat to confidence and consumption. As such, the value of the market relative to the value of the economy—as shown by the \"Buffett Indicator\" in the chart below—underscores that, through the wealth effect, the economy may feel a tighter pinch when the next bear market arrives. Stocks\\' surge relative to growth Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 9/30/2021. This doesn\\'t equate to a deterioration in financial system stability or liquidity, though; if that were to occur, the Fed may very well take steps to alleviate any ruptures. Yet, the possibility of continued weakness in stocks—and ultimately, the economy—may end up doing some of the tightening work for the Fed, which reinforces our view that it remains premature to expect a significant number of rate hikes this year, especially when the power of the reduction of the balance sheet is still unknown. In sum The Fed is on a mission to get off the \"zero bound\" for the fed funds rate, while also starting to shrink its behemoth balance sheet. Tightening of policy, and financial conditions, will continue to cause market volatility—across both the equity and bond markets. The Fed is not operating with a pre-determined playbook, with the use of the balance sheet as a key policy tool still evolving. For now, recession risk remains low, but keep an eye on leading economic indicators, as well as the yield curve. Peaks in the former, and inversions in the latter have been consistent recession warnings signals historically. In the meantime, remain diversified and disciplined, with an over-arching focus on quality for the stock-pickers out there.'},\n",

There are multiple ways to save for higher education, and what works best for you depends on your (or your loved one\\'s) personal needs and life goals.

If you want to set aside money for college expenses that aren\\'t covered by an Education Savings Account or 529 plan, a custodial account can help. The benefits: You can take advantage of the gift tax exclusion and control how the money is invested and spent for the benefit of the child, while your child is still a minor. The drawbacks: Your child can use the money however he or she wants after reaching a certain age, and investment income in custodial accounts may trigger the kiddie tax. Custodial accounts: the basics Custodial accounts—also known as UGMA or UTMA accounts after the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act that created them—are created for your child and managed by you. However, when your child reaches \"termination age\" —typically 18, 21 or 25 years depending on your state—the money automatically becomes his or hers. The main benefits of a custodial account are that you can take advantage of the gift tax exclusion, and still have control over how the money is invested and spent while your child is a minor (as long as it is for their benefit). However, the exclusion requires the money to be an irrevocable \"no strings attached\" gift. For example, let\\'s say you\\'re managing a custodial account for your daughter. You may both agree that the money should be used for college, but when your daughter reaches termination age, the account reverts to her and she can use the money for anything she wants—college, a new car, a vacation, or something else entirely. However, some states may allow you to specify a later date to turn over the account\\'s assets to your child, as long as that date follows state law. In contrast, 529 plans and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) give you much more control over how the funds are used, including the ability to change beneficiaries as the need arises. The main limitation being that the funds must be used specifically for certain education expenses in order to receive tax advantages. With that said, a custodial account may still fit your needs under certain circumstances. Custodial accounts can supplement a 529 plan or an ESA for your child\\'s college education. If you want to set aside money for college expenses that aren’t covered by an ESA or 529 plan—sorority dues or car repairs, for example—a custodial account may be just the thing your child needs. The table below shows how custodial accounts compare to 529 plans. 1 Check with the 529 plan date rules to see if this option is permitted. Not all states follow the new federal tax rules. 2 Amounts over $16,000 per person ($32,000 for a married couple) in 2022 may be subject to the gift tax. How to open and contribute to a custodial account You can open a custodial account at virtually any brokerage or financial institution, and the minimum to open such an account typically ranges from $500 to $2,000. Anyone (parents, grandparents, other relatives, and friends) can make unlimited contributions to a custodial account once it\\'s open. However, a person can\\'t contribute more than $16,000 per year ($32,000 for a married couple) in 2022 without potentially triggering a gift tax. The kiddie tax Unlike 529 plans and ESAs, custodial accounts are subject to the so-called \"kiddie tax.\" This tax rule applies to unearned income (i.e., investment income) up to a certain threshold. Over that threshold, the child will pay taxes at the parent\\'s tax rate. How custodial accounts are taxed in 2021 and 2022 3 Full-time college students under the age of 24 may also be taxed at their parents\\' rate on unearned income in excess of $2,200 in 2021, and $2,300 in 2022, unless the students\\' earned income was greater than one-half of their support. Earned income from a job or self-employment is not subject to the kiddie tax. Effect on financial aid Custodial accounts can have a heavy impact on financial aid. Because the money in a custodial account is your child\\'s asset and not yours, federal financial aid formulas consider 20% of the money available to pay for college. Compare this to 529 plans, which are given more favorable treatment for financial aid. (The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) formula considers a maximum of 5.64% of the money to be available in a parent-owned 529 plan available for college because the money is considered the parent\\'s assets and not the child\\'s.) While you can\\'t roll over or directly transfer custodial account assets into a 529 account, you can cash out and reinvest the proceeds into a custodial 529 savings plan for the same minor. The benefit for doing so is that the UGMA/UTMA 529 account would still be considered a parent-owned asset and assessed at the 5.64% rate under FAFSA. Keep in mind that you\\'ll be subject to pay taxes on any gains if you choose this option. Additionally, not all 529 plans automatically allow for the transfer of funds from custodial accounts. Check to see if your 529 allows custodial account funds to be transferred. And remember, if you set up a custodial 529 account, the money can only be used for the same child specifically listed as the beneficiary of the UGMA/UTMA custodial account. You cannot rename the beneficiary and use the assets for another person. The bottom line Saving and investing for college is a wise move, even if you believe your child may qualify for financial aid. Remember, the majority of financial aid comes in the form of loans, which must be repaid with interest.'}],\n",

       "   'content': 'Many people who save money in traditional 401(k)s, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) or other tax-deferred investment vehicles do so assuming their income-tax rate in retirement will be lower than that of their working years. The whole premise behind tax deferral is we know we’re going to have to pay income tax on this money eventually—we just want it to be less in retirement than what we\\'d pay during our working years. However, it\\'s not unusual for retirees to find themselves in the same or an even higher tax bracket in retirement. How so? \"Many people tap accumulated wealth outside their IRAs,\" says Kathy Cashatt, a Schwab senior financial planner in Phoenix. \"When you add that income to Social Security and the required minimum distributions (RMDs) you can land in an unexpectedly high tax bracket.\" Keep in mind with the passage of the SECURE Act, the age for the onset of RMDs changed to 72 for retirees who turned 70½ after December 31, 2019. Fortunately, a number of strategies can help reduce the impact of RMDs. How is the RMD calculated? The IRS calculates RMDs by taking the sum total of all your tax-deferred retirement accounts at the end of each year and dividing it by a number based on life expectancy and other factors. The denominator gets smaller and smaller as your age increases, meaning your distributions get larger and larger. For example, the denominator starts at 27.4 for those age 72, or about $3,650 for every $100,000 in savings, and declines to a low of 2 for those age 120 or older, or about $50,000 for every $100,000 in savings (see chart below). RMD amounts change over time Required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred retirement accounts increase as you age. Source: IRS.gov. Many IRA custodians will notify account holders of their RMDs each January (though the IRS holds the account owner ultimately responsible for getting the calculations right). Schwab offers an online calculator to help investors estimate annual distributions. The cost of miscalculating or failing to withdraw the full amount is steep: The IRS charges a 50% penalty on any withdrawals required but not taken. In many ways, the first year of RMDs can be the toughest. That\\'s because your initial distribution isn\\'t due until April 1 of the year after you turn 70½ (or 72 if you’re subject to the new rules)—even though your second RMD is due on December 31 of that same year. \"Two sizable, taxable withdrawals in the same tax year can more easily bump you into a higher bracket,\" says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, and director of tax planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, \"so it\\'s often best to take your initial distribution during the first calendar year in which it\\'s mandated.\" Even after that initial hump, IRA holders should remain vigilant, because your remaining balances will continue to fluctuate—and with them your RMDs. A step-by-step guide to calculating your RMD Add up all tax-deferred retirement account balances as of 12/31/2021. Find the number that corresponds to the age you will turn in 2021 from the table below. Divide No. 1 by No. 2. This is your required minimum distribution for 2022. Source: IRS.gov. If your spouse is the sole beneficiary of your tax-deferred retirement accounts and he or she is more than 10 years younger than you, visit the Required Minimum Distribution Worksheets page of IRS.gov for a worksheet specific to your situation. When should you begin drawing down your accounts? Option 1: Begin taking withdrawals at age 59 ½ One approach is to begin withdrawing funds from tax-deferred accounts at age 59½—generally your earliest opportunity without incurring a 10% penalty—although not so much that you edge yourself into a higher tax bracket. \"One way to do this is by using a proportional withdrawal strategy,\" Hayden says. This strategy can reduce the overall size of your tax-deferred accounts, and with them your RMDs once you turn 70½ (or 72 if you\\'re subject to the SECURE Act rules). Such withdrawals can also help make it possible to defer claiming your Social Security benefit, which increases 8% for every year you wait to collect beyond your full retirement age (up to age 70, after which there is no incremental benefit). Option 2: Convert your IRA to a Roth IRA A second strategy is a Roth conversion, where you convert holdings in your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, which is exempt from RMDs. There are several situations in which such a conversion may make sense: You believe you\\'ll be in a higher bracket when you eventually withdraw the money. You want to manage or reduce distributions once you hit your RMD age. You want to leave your heirs an income-tax-free asset, as Roth withdrawals aren’t subject to income tax, assuming you’ve held the account for at least five years. \"If you have a sizable income in retirement or don’t need the IRA money for living expenses, a Roth conversion could be a good approach,\" Hayden says. However, you\\'ll pay ordinary income tax on the amount distributed from your regular IRA—and it\\'s to your advantage to pay any income-tax liability from other taxable account assets. That\\'s because, if you\\'re under the age 59 1/2, tapping IRA funds to pay the tax bill stemming from your Roth conversion will result in a 10% penalty on top of any ordinary income tax. Whereas if you\\'re over age 59½, using your IRA funds to satisfy your tax bill reduces the amount left to grow tax-free, undercutting the rationale behind your Roth conversion to begin with. A Roth IRA conversion can be especially advantageous during your initial years of retirement, when RMDs haven\\'t yet kicked in and you’re most likely to be in a lower tax bracket vis-à-vis your working years. Roth IRA Conversion Does converting to a Roth IRA make sense for you? User Schwab\\'s Roth IRA conversion calculator to compare the estimated future values of keeping your Traditional IRA vs. converting it to a Roth, as well as an estimate of the taxes you’d owe if you convert your account. We recommend working with a qualified financial planner when making any decisions. Option 3: Make a qualified charitable distribution Once you reach 70 1/2, a third option to reduce or entirely satisfy your RMDs opens up: a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), in which funds are transferred directly from an IRA to a qualified charitable organization. QCDs count toward RMDs but are not taxable, and an individual, whether married or single, can donate up to $100,000 a year from her or his own IRA—with several important caveats: Your IRA custodian must transfer the funds directly—and only to a 501(c)(3) organization (donor-advised funds aren\\'t eligible). You can\\'t claim the QCD as a charitable deduction, though neither does the distribution count as taxable income. \"A QCD can make a lot of sense if charitable giving is already part of your overall financial plan,\" Hayden says. \"You get the satisfaction of helping a worthy cause, while also covering a portion or all of your RMD.\" Putting the puzzle together Given the complexities involved with RMDs and the tax strategies involved with the options mentioned above, it\\'s best to consult with a certified public accountant or qualified tax advisor who can help you navigate the intricacies of taking your distributions. \"From multiple tax-deferred accounts to Social Security to other potential sources of income, there are a number of moving pieces,\" Kathy says. \"That\\'s why we recommend meeting with a financial planner or tax professional to help you strategize the best way to minimize taxes in retirement.\"'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'How fast you can cash out of the stock market is less important than maintaining a long-term plan.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, If I invest my savings in the stock market, how fast can I get cash if I need it quickly? —A Reader Dear Reader, Thanks for asking this because what seems like a fairly straightforward question opens the door to a whole lot more discussion. The timing rules for selling stocks and getting the cash are pretty clear and I\\'ll go over those for you. But what I\\'d like to emphasize is the importance of deciding upfront how much money to keep easily accessible and how much to invest. Much of that decision depends on your goals because the way you should save and prepare for short-term needs is very different from how you should prepare for long-term goals. And it\\'s the money you earmark for long-term goals that is most appropriate for the stock market. But before we get into that, let me first answer your specific question. How quickly you can get your cash when you sell an investment When you buy or sell securities, the official transfer of the securities to the buyer\\'s account or the cash to the seller\\'s account is called \"settlement.\" For most stock trades, settlement happens two business days after the trade is executed. An easy and common way to remember this is T+2, which stands for trade date plus an additional two days. For example, if your sell order executes on Monday, you\\'d have your cash available by Wednesday. However, the T+2 rule applies only to trades of individual stocks, bonds and exchange traded funds (ETFs). If you own mutual funds, the timing is different. Mutual fund trades typically settle the next business day, so it\\'s possible you could get your money as soon as the day after you sell. Money market mutual funds are even faster; they settle on the same day the trade is executed. As you can see, the time it takes to get your cash depends on what type of investments you hold. But no matter what type of investment you sell, be aware that if you transfer your money from one account to another, say from a brokerage account to a bank checking account, it could take a another few days for the electronic funds transfer to be completed. What to do before you get into the market Settlement details aside, it\\'s essential to think through your personal situation and different goals before you invest in the stock market. Here\\'s what I suggest: Make retirement a priority—If you\\'re saving for retirement or another long-term goal, investing in the stock market is completely appropriate but it’s important to consider how much risk and volatility you can withstand along the way. So you have to think long term (5-10+ years) to give yourself a better chance of riding out the inevitable dips. Otherwise, you could get caught needing to sell at the wrong time and sustain a substantial loss. Always start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, if offered. Save money for emergencies—Make sure you have an adequate rainy day fund. You never know what might happen. Aim to put away enough money to cover three to six months’ of necessary expenses (rent, utilities, food, medical, insurance) in a savings or money market account. That way, if something bad happens such as a layoff, car repair or health problem, you can get to your money immediately. Stop giving so much to credit card companies—The stock market has virtually unlimited upside but it’s not a smooth ride and there are no guarantees. Paying down high interest consumer debt is a sure way to improve your financial picture. Take a hard look at your debt situation before investing in the stock market. Think about additional savings for short-term goals—What money might you need in the next 3-5 years? For instance, are you saving for a vacation or a down payment on a house you hope to buy in the near future? Depending on your specific time frame you could put that money in money market accounts, short-term CDs or even short-term bonds—something easily accessible and secure. Don’t set it and forget it after you invest It may seem counter-intuitive, but there can also be situations where you might be keeping your money in the stock market too long. And that goes back to the idea of time frame. For instance, a parent saving for a child\\'s education should probably start shifting the money out of stocks and into more conservative investments like bonds or cash the closer the student gets to college. Again, it\\'s not a question of how quickly you can get the cash out but rather getting the cash out without a loss. You don\\'t want to take too much risk with money you\\'ll need sooner rather than later. Don\\'t wait to get started Your seemingly simple question about the time it takes to get your money out of the market has triggered a lot of other considerations. And one of the most important timing considerations of all is just to get started. To me, investing in stocks is one of the best ways to grow your long-term savings. Which brings me to one of the classic sayings about investing: \"Time in the market is more important than timing the market.\" And if you\\'re young and just getting started, time may be your greatest asset.

       "   'abstract': 'A large home bias, even with international sales exposure, may not diversify investors across sectors, endangering financial goals when new economic cycles shift long term trends.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Most investors are probably less diversified than they think they are. For one thing, investing in U.S. companies with international sales exposure is not equivalent to international stock exposure. In addition, many major countries (like the U.S.) perform like just one sector of the stock market, leaving investors with a large home bias and potentially a lack of diversification. Finally, the start of a new economic cycle with a rising inflation outlook may signal a switch to international stock market outperformance in the years ahead. Home bias When investors talk about the stock market, they are most often referring to an index that tracks stocks only in their home country. This home bias is often evident in the make-up of investors\\' stock portfolios. Investors around the world tend to hold mostly domestic stocks, regardless of their country\\'s global market capitalization, as you can see in the chart below. U.S. investors, for example, tend to put 75% of their equity holdings in domestic stocks, despite U.S. stocks only making up 58% of global market capitalization. American investors with holdings based entirely in the U.S. are missing out on about half of the world\\'s investable universe. Home bias: Investors\\' portfolios tend to overweight their home country no matter where they live Source: Charles Schwab, Macrobond, World Federation of Exchanges, IMF, World Bank as of 2/10/2022. Investors with a large home bias are not only concentrated geographically, but also may not be nearly as diversified across sectors as they believe and might risk missing their financial goals as longer-term trends shift with the start of a new global economic cycle. Can\\'t get there from here In a more globally connected world, where items we consume on a daily basis can originate from anywhere, it is reasonable to believe that U.S. firms have international exposure through their sales. Yet, it isn\\'t possible to simply invest in U.S. companies with international sales exposure and get international stock exposure. Big companies in the same sector or industry typically serve the same global customer base. For example, U.S.-headquartered Coca Cola and Nestle, a Swiss-headquartered company, have the same geographic distribution of sales by region, to within a few percentage points. They both get about 25-35% of their revenue from the U.S., about 20% from the rest of the Americas, 20-25% from Europe and another 20-25% from Asia, and about 5-10% from Africa and the Middle East. Coca-Cola and Nestle both sell beverages and snacks to the same folks around the world. This similarity seems to suggest that there shouldn\\'t be much difference in the performance of stocks in the same industry that are headquartered inside or outside the United States. But, in truth, there is a difference. Over the 20 years ending in December 2021, Nestle\\'s stock rose 550%, vastly outpacing Coca-Cola\\'s gain of 151%. Why? Because there are many factors that drive stock performance besides revenue allocation. Similar customers, different performance Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 2/10/2022.

All corporate names are for illustrative purposes only and are not a recommendation, offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Dollar direction Returns can also differ across borders due to movement in currencies. By holding an investment denominated in another currency, an investor will experience both the change in the asset price (in that currency) but also the change in the value of the currency, when measuring a portfolio in dollars. Since currency valuation can move as much as the stock price, it\\'s an important factor to consider. The U.S. dollar is the world\\'s most-used currency, but that doesn\\'t mean its value is a constant. When the dollar falls relative to other currencies U.S. dollar-based investors in international stocks tend to benefit. Here is an example: In July 2020, European stocks fell -1.5%, as measured in euros; the U.S. dollar also fell versus the euro by 4.8%. The overall effect was European stocks posting a gain of +3.3%, as measured in U.S. dollars. That\\'s a big effect. Currency contribution Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 2/10/22. July 2020 price change of MSCI Europe Index and EUR-USD exchange rate. Sector surprise No one country offers complete global stock market exposure across all sectors. It may be surprising to know how closely some major countries\\' stock markets perform like a single sector of the global stock market, and a portfolio with a large home bias may be providing you with an unintended sector concentration. For example, although only 12% of the value of the stocks in the MSCI World Automobiles Index are German companies, the German stock market has closely tracked the performance of auto stocks for most of the past two decades. Germany driven by autos Source: Charles Schwab, Factset data as of 2/10/22. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Other examples of the lack of diversification owing to high sector correlation among major markets include: The Canadian stock market performs much like the energy sector. The Canadian economy is more reliant than most on natural resources, where even the banks are tied to the commodity cycle. In Japan, the stock market closely tracks the global financial sector. Even though the financial sector is not the largest in Japan\\'s stock market, the influence of global financial conditions on all types of Japanese companies is evident in their performance. In the United States, the largest sector of the stock market, technology, seems to drive overall performance. The U.S. market acts a lot like one big technology fund. Differences in stock market performance by country seem to be driven by these sector influences, more than by politics or economics. The United States has performed the best since the start of the 2000s as it tracked the run up in the world information technology sector. The United States was followed by Canada, fueled by the world energy sector. Japan was the weakest, held back by the poor performance of the world financials sector. Countries and sectors Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 2/10/22. Annualized price performance in U.S. dollars for period from 12/31/00 to 12/31/21. U.S. = MSCI USA Index, Technology = MSCI World Information Technology Index, Japan = MSCI Japan Index, Financials = MSCI World Financials Index, Canada = MSCI Canada Index, Energy = MSCI World Energy Index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Global diversification can help with exposure to whatever sector is performing the best, rather than being tied to the sector that happens to drive the performance of your home country. New cycle, new leadership? Market leadership tends to last for many years, even a decade, before reversing. It usually switches between U.S. and international stocks at the start of a new cycle. For example, after international stocks outperformed in the 1980s, the 1990 recession saw a shift to U.S. outperformance, then the 2001 recession saw a switch back to international outperformance, then the 2008 recession flipped the switch again to U.S. outperformance. These changes in leadership result from behavioral as well as fundamental factors. After a full cycle of outperformance, relative valuations and earnings expectations become stretched and begin to reverse with the catalyst of a new cycle. And now, the start of a new cycle may once again signal a switch to international stocks in the years ahead. Annualized performance by economic cycle Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 12/31/21. Dates reflect economic cycle peaks defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Annualized total return between cycle peaks measured by MSCI USA Index and MSCI EAFE Index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Changing global economic conditions in a new cycle also contribute to a change in leadership. Historically, when long-term inflation expectations are rising, U.S. stocks tend to underperform international stocks with turning points lagging by about two years, as you can see in the chart below. This suggests we may now be at a turning point favoring the relative performance of international stocks due to their greater inflation sensitivity.

Median from monthly University of Michigan survey of U.S. households. \"By what percent per year do you expect prices to go up, on the average, during the next 5 to 10 years?\" Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Global investing Fortunately, as many investors around the world consider reducing their home bias, obtaining global diversification has never been easier or less expensive. How much exposure outside your home country should you have in your portfolio? The answer depends on your risk tolerance and time horizon. It is clear from the data that most investors can broaden their opportunity set and diversify their portfolios simply by significantly boosting the international portion of their stock portfolios. Now may be a good time to consider rebalancing portfolios back toward international stocks since years of U.S. stock outperformance may have caused a drift away from longer-term targets.

       "   'content': 'When it comes to finances, taxes are often overlooked as a ripe area for savings. Setting aside money in tax-advantaged accounts, for example, can drop you into a lower tax bracket and help you keep more of what you\\'ve earned—even if you wait until tax time to do it. \"As an investor, it\\'s important to take advantage of every factor you can influence, and your tax situation certainly qualifies,\" says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, and director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"Taxes are one of those areas where even a little forethought can yield significant savings.\" We\\'ve already started the new year, but it\\'s not too late to impact your 2021 tax situation. Here are four tax-smart moves you can still make between now and April 18 (or April 19 for taxpayers in Maine and Massachusetts), the IRS filing deadline this year.1 1. Consider contributing to a traditional IRA One way to potentially save on your 2021 taxes and put away money for later is to contribute to a traditional individual retirement account (IRA). If you qualify, these accounts can give you upfront tax deductibility on your contributions, plus tax-deferred growth of your earnings. For 2021, you can contribute up to $6,000 to a traditional IRA (plus a $1,000 catch-up if you\\'re age 50 and over), and you have until Tax Day to do so. Because contributions to a traditional IRA reduce your taxable income dollar for dollar, they could be enough to drop you into a lower tax bracket. Given that some gaps between tax brackets are quite large—for instance, the drop from 22% to 12%—those savings can be significant. Contributing to a Roth IRA, on the other hand, won\\'t lower your taxable income today. But it might help you save on taxes in retirement, depending on your goals. \"In some cases, a Roth may make more sense than a traditional IRA,\" Hayden explains, \"for example, if you\\'re in a low tax bracket today but expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you withdraw the money.\" 2. Consider a SEP IRA, if you\\'re self-employed As a small business owner, you may be eligible for a traditional or Roth IRA. But you might be able to save even more by opening a Simplified Employee Pension (known as a SEP IRA), if you meet certain requirements. Like a traditional IRA, contributions to SEP IRAs are made with pre-tax dollars. So, they reduce your taxable income up front, and you won\\'t pay taxes until you withdraw the money. For 2021, you can set aside up to 20% of your net income from self-employment or $58,000, whichever is less. If you have employees, you can contribute retirement savings for them as well—up to 25% of their compensation or $58,000. You have until the due date of your return (including any extensions) to make contributions and get a tax deduction for 2021. 3. Max out your HSA Health savings accounts (HSAs) have risen in popularity in recent years to help offset the costs of high-deductible health plans.2 These accounts offer a triple tax advantage: Contributions generally reduce your taxable income, any growth on money invested in the HSA is tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free as long as they\\'re used for qualified medical expenses. Some savers may not realize they have until Tax Day to contribute to their HSA for the 2021 tax year. For 2021, individuals can sock away up to $3,600 in tax-free HSA contributions and up to $7,200 for families. If you\\'re over age 55, you can set aside an additional $1,000. If you haven\\'t maxed out your HSA for 2021, closing the gap before the filing deadline could result in a lower tax bill. \"Because HSAs let you roll over your savings from year to year, that money will be available to you if you need it for medical expenses,\" Hayden says. \"And if you don\\'t need the money right now, you can invest a portion of it and potentially enjoy tax-free growth.\" 4. Don\\'t rule out itemizing too quickly The tax-code changes from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) raised the standard deduction while reducing expenses taxpayers can itemize. Despite these changes, itemizing your deductions could still make sense. One of the biggest deductions, for mortgage interest, is still on the table. If you bought your home after December 15, 2017, you can deduct interest on up to $750,000 of indebtedness. And the limit for homes bought on or before that date is still $1 million. You may also be able to deduct a combined total of $10,000 in property tax, state and local income tax, or sales tax paid in 2021. The sales tax deduction applies to all purchases made during the year, including food, clothing, home improvements, or a new car. If you live in a state with no or lower income tax, sales tax might get you a bigger tax break than the state and local tax deduction. Don\\'t overlook other opportunities to itemize. For instance, medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) can be deducted. And under the CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, individuals may deduct 100% of AGI on cash donations to qualifying operating charities for 2021. If you\\'re a single filer and your deductions exceed $12,550 (or $25,100 for married couples filing jointly), then itemizing would save you more money than the standard deduction. Just be sure to keep receipts for each expense you\\'re itemizing, and check with an accountant if you\\'re not sure which costs are deductible. Don\\'t delay With taxes, it\\'s always best to double-check your math and assumptions. If you have questions, talk to a tax professional. Mistakes can quickly erode the potential benefits of tax-saving moves, especially if you miss IRS deadlines. Well before Tax Day, be sure to: Determine if a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or SEP IRA is right for you and how to get the most out of one. Check with your employer or healthcare/HSA provider to find out about opening an HSA account if you\\'re part of a qualified high-deductible health plan or increasing your contributions if you haven\\'t hit the 2021 limit. Gather any documents, forms, or receipts you\\'ll need to help you decide if you should itemize your deductions. 1Washington, D.C., will recognize the Emancipation Day holiday on April 15 in 2022, so the tax deadline moves to April 18 except for taxpayers in Maine and Massachusetts, who have until April 19 because of the Patriots\\' Day holiday in those states. 2A high-deductible health plan is defined as having a minimum annual deductible of $1,400 for individuals and $2,800 for families. The insured can\\'t be enrolled in Medicare, claimed as a dependent on someone else\\'s tax return, or covered by another health plan without a high deductible.'},\n",

As a result, many investors approach a sizable withdrawal as they would a smaller one—with potentially negative consequences for both their taxes and overall portfolio performance. Here are three of the most common mistakes people make when managing a large portfolio withdrawal—and how to avoid them. Mistake #1: Withdrawing all at once Selling substantial assets in a single calendar year—versus staggering the distribution over two or more years—increases your total taxable income and could be enough to bump you into a higher tax bracket. \"Depending on the size of the withdrawal, you might want to split it up over multiple years,\" says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"If you don\\'t, you could get hit with a big tax bill.\" To help minimize your tax bill, start by figuring out how much money you\\'ll need and how soon you\\'ll need it, and work backward from there. Then you can look at several strategies, such as tax-gain harvesting or topping off tax brackets, to get the cash you need with the least amount of tax impact. Here\\'s how topping off a tax bracket could work to save taxes. Let\\'s say Jeremy and Irene are both age 62. For 2022, they have $72,000 of income, which means their taxable income would be $46,100 after taking the $25,900 standard deduction for a married couple—putting them in the 12% marginal tax bracket. They\\'ve determined that they can afford a second home, which they plan on purchasing in 2024, and need $50,000 for the down payment. They decide the funds will come from Jeremy\\'s traditional IRA, so the withdrawal will be taxed as ordinary income. If Jeremy and Irene withdraw the full amount this year, their total taxable income—including the IRA distribution—would bump some of that withdrawal into the next higher tax bracket of 22%. That means they would need to take out $59,301 to cover the estimated $9,301 in taxes they would owe on that withdrawal to get them the $50,000 down payment they need.1 By splitting the distribution over two years, they can remain in the lower 12% tax bracket (assuming no income or tax changes) and would only need to withdraw about $56,818 over two years, potentially saving them $2,483 in taxes. It would work like this: They could take $37,450 out of Jeremy\\'s IRA this year and owe roughly $4,494 in taxes (at the 12% tax rate) on the withdrawal. Then the next year, they could withdraw $19,368 from his IRA, paying about $2,324 in taxes (at the 12% tax rate)—giving them $50,000 after taxes for the down payment.2 By using the tax strategy of splitting their distributions and topping off the 12% tax bracket, Jeremy and Irene would be able to reduce their overall taxes, thereby minimizing the amount they would need to withdraw from Jeremy\\'s retirement savings. Spreading a large withdrawal across several years—particularly if you\\'re near the upper end of your tax bracket—can often result in a significant savings, Hayden says. Mistake #2: Avoiding selling at a loss Investors often have a natural antipathy toward selling investments at a loss. This so-called loss aversion can cause us to overlook our underperforming investments when deciding which assets to sell. \"It\\'s hard for many people to stomach losses, but they can actually be a boon, tax-wise, if you hold the investment in a taxable brokerage account,\" Rob says. Not all underperforming assets are fit for the chopping block, but those with weak future prospects or that no longer fit your investment strategy are prime candidates. \"When you sell an investment for less than you paid, you can use the capital loss to offset capital gains from the sale of other assets in a taxable brokerage account that have appreciated, potentially reducing your tax bill,\" Hayden explains. This strategy is called tax-loss harvesting and can lower taxes on your investments if done wisely. What\\'s more, if your capital losses exceed your capital gains from investments held and sold in a taxable brokerage account, you can use those losses to potentially reduce your ordinary taxable income by up to $3,000. Anything above that can be carried over to future tax years. A large withdrawal is also an ideal opportunity to rebalance your portfolio. As withdrawals and market fluctuations alter the proportions of your portfolio holdings, your asset allocation may stray from its target, causing some positions to be overweight and others underweight. \"It\\'s important to keep your portfolio in line with your risk tolerance and time horizon,\" Rob says. Cutting your losses can cut your tax bill Offsetting capital gains with capital losses—a.k.a. tax-loss harvesting—can potentially lower your taxes. For illustrative purposes only. The long-term capital gains rate of 20% assumes a combined 15% federal rate and 5% state rate. Investors may pay higher or lower long-term capital gains rates based on their income and filing status. Mistake #3: Neglecting your other goals Jeremy and Irene are likely saving—and investing—for multiple goals, not only for their vacation home in Idaho. For this and other reasons, it makes sense to diversify your savings by the type of account you invest in, as well as the size—and timing—of your goals. This strategy is called tax diversification. \"One of the benefits of tax diversification is having different types of accounts—taxable brokerage, traditional IRA and 401(k), Roth IRA and 401(k)—you can choose from to minimize the tax impact of a withdrawal,\" Hayden notes. Contributions to Roth 401(k)s and Roth IRAs, for example, are made with after-tax dollars, meaning contributions won\\'t reduce your current taxable income, and you won\\'t owe taxes on appreciation, income, or withdrawals in retirement (provided the account holder is over age 59½ and has held the account for five years or more). Pre-tax contributions to tax-deferred accounts—which include 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and traditional IRAs—generally reduce your current tax bill and aren\\'t taxed until you withdraw the money. Withdrawals are subject to ordinary income taxes, which can be higher than preferential tax rates on long-term capital gains from the sale of assets in taxable accounts, and, if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty (barring certain exceptions). Meanwhile, withdrawals from a taxable brokerage account may be subject to capital gains rates of 0% to 20%—plus an additional 3.8% Net Income Investment Tax for single filers with a modified adjusted gross income greater than $200,000 ($250,000 if you\\'re married filing jointly). Of course, a particularly large withdrawal does not need to come from a single account. Rather, you can pick and choose, based on the overall composition of your portfolio and what makes the most sense for your situation. When to consider borrowing If you need access to capital but are hesitant to liquidate part of your portfolio because of tax consequences, such as a down market or other considerations, it might make sense to borrow to fund your goal. Rob notes that if you were to borrow the funds at an interest rate that’s less than your expected portfolio return, you could come out ahead. Of course, there is no guarantee your portfolio will achieve its stated objective, and you should consider whether you are willing to assume the risk that it won’t. If you borrow against your home, interest payments may be tax-deductible so long as you use the proceeds to improve your home or purchase a second home3, and your total itemized deduction is larger than your standard deduction. \"That can further reduce the cost of borrowing,\" Rob says, subject to current limitations and caps from the IRS on how much you can deduct. You could also consider borrowing against the value of your investments with a margin loan from a brokerage firm or with a securities-based line of credit offered by a bank. Both involve risk, and it\\'s important to understand these risks before borrowing.4 Margin loans and bank-offered, security-based lines of credit might make sense for investors with higher wealth or flexibility who have low-volatility assets to borrow against, who are in control of their debt, and for whom the level of risk is appropriate. Entering into a securities-based line of credit and pledging securities as collateral involves risk if the value of your investments falls.

This means an additional $21,851 withdrawal would be necessary for a total distribution of $59,301. The estimated tax of on this distribution would be $9,301, leaving $50,000 after taxes for the down payment. 2Example assumes a $37,450 distribution in year 1, followed by a $19,368 distribution in year 2, for a total withdrawal of $56,818 over 2 years. The total $56,818 withdrawal would be taxed at 12%, resulting in an estimated tax of $6,818, leaving $50,000 after taxes for the down payment. 3Until it expires in 2026, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 suspends the deduction for interest paid on home equity loans and lines of credit, unless they are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the taxpayer\\'s home that secures the loan. The law imposes a lower dollar limit on mortgages qualifying for the home mortgage interest deduction. Taxpayers may only deduct interest on $750,000 ($375,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return) of qualified residence loans. The limits apply to the combined amount of loans used to buy, build, or substantially improve the taxpayer\\'s main home and second home. 4For a bank-offered, securities-based line of credit, the lending bank will generally require securities used as collateral to be held in a separate, pledged brokerage account held at a broker-dealer, which may be an affiliate of the bank. The bank, in its sole discretion, generally determines the eligible collateral criteria and the loan value of collateral.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'For many investors entering their 70s, diligently contributing to tax-deferred retirement accounts must soon turn to diligently drawing them down. That\\'s because the government requires retirees to take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from such accounts starting at age 72. \"Many retirees are daunted by RMDs, in part because of the steep penalties for withdrawing too little,\" says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"But RMDs really aren\\'t so complicated once you understand a few basics.\" With that in mind, let\\'s take a look at how to calculate your RMDs, how to manage the distributions effectively, and how to potentially reduce the associated tax hit. 1. Do the math In general, once you reach age 72, you must begin taking annual RMDs from all tax-deferred retirement accounts, including: 401(k), 403(b), and similar workplace retirement plans—including Roth 401(k)s1 (see \"The rules around Roths,\" below) SEP IRAs SIMPLE IRAs Traditional IRAs Generally speaking, you can calculate your RMDs for a given year by taking your account balance on December 31 of the prior year and dividing it by your \"distribution period\"—a number the IRS assigns to each age beginning at 72 (see \"Running the numbers,\" below). Running the numbers A simple calculation can help you determine your RMDs for the year. Source: IRS publication 590-B (2022 draft version). Table does not include the distribution period for all ages. A separate table is used if the sole beneficiary is the account owner’s spouse who is 10 or more years younger than the owner. For example, let\\'s say you\\'re 75, single, and ended last year with $2 million in your IRA. According to the table above, your distribution period is 24.6—which means your RMD for the year would be $81,301 ($2,000,000 divided by 24.6). If you have multiple tax-deferred retirement accounts, RMDs must be calculated separately for each one. Many financial institutions, including Schwab, will calculate your RMDs for you—and may even offer automated withdrawals—but typically only for the accounts held at their firms. \"Those looking to streamline their RMDs might consider consolidating their retirement accounts with a single firm to reduce the odds of withdrawing too much or too little,\" Hayden says. The rules around Roths RMDs also are required from Roth 401(k) accounts, despite those accounts being funded with after-tax dollars. \"This rule surprises a lot of people because it differs from Roth IRAs, whose funds can stay invested indefinitely during the account owner\\'s lifetime,\" Hayden says. If you\\'d like to avoid taking RMDs from your Roth 401(k), the easiest solution is to roll the funds into a Roth IRA before you reach age 72. \"Doing so allows that money to remain invested for tax-free growth,\" Hayden says. \"Plus, you\\'ll generally have more investment options with an IRA than you would with a 401(k).\" RMDs also are required from Roth 401(k) accounts, despite those accounts being funded with after-tax dollars. \"This rule surprises a lot of people because it differs from Roth IRAs, whose funds can stay invested indefinitely during the account owner\\'s lifetime,\" Hayden says.

Take the money—or else You must withdraw your entire RMD amount by December 31 of each year, with two possible exceptions: It\\'s your first RMD. You may choose to delay your first RMD until April 1 of the year following your 72nd birthday. However, delaying your first distribution means taking your first and second RMDs in the same tax year, which could significantly increase your taxable income. \"This strategy may make sense if you’re still bringing in steady income,\" Hayden says. \"But for most people, it\\'s usually better to take the distribution by the end of their 72nd year.\" You\\'re still working. If you\\'re an active participant in your current employer\\'s qualified retirement plan and you don\\'t own more than 5% of the business, you can delay taking RMDs from that account until April 1 of the year after you retire—but you must continue taking RMDs from all other accounts. Those with significant savings should carefully consider whether it makes sense to delay withdrawals. \"By postponing those distributions, you\\'re allowing your savings to potentially grow even more in the intervening years,\" Hayden says. \"That\\'s not bad per se, but it does mean you could see a significant bump in the size of your RMDs, and thus your tax bill, once you retire.\" If you miss a deadline or don\\'t withdraw your full RMD, the penalty is stiff: 50% of the amount you failed to withdraw. For example, if your RMD was $100,000 but you withdrew only $50,000, you’d owe half the shortfall ($25,000) as a penalty. As for when in the year to take your RMDs, it will ultimately depend on your income needs and personal preferences. For example, some may choose to take a lump-sum distribution at the beginning of the year so they don’t have to think about it again until the following year, while others might find that taking regular withdrawals is the simplest way to meet their RMD requirements and manage their cash flow. However, Hayden cautions against waiting to take RMDs until the end of the year. \"You don\\'t want to accidentally forget about them during the holidays,\" he says. Regardless of when and how you take your withdrawals, you should view it as an opportunity to revisit whether your asset allocation is still in line with your risk tolerance and rebalance as needed. \"That way, you\\'re satisfying your RMDs for the year and ensuring your portfolio continues to be aligned with your goals,\" Hayden says. 3. Be tax smart Retirees sometimes find that their RMDs provide more income than they need in a given year. \"What\\'s more, when combined with other income sources, like dividends and interest payments, RMDs can push you into a higher tax bracket and could affect the taxation of Social Security benefits and the premiums you pay for Medicare,\" Hayden says. If you\\'re worried about the effects of RMDs on your tax bill and health care costs, there are several strategies you can employ before and after age 72 to reduce them: Make withdrawals prior to age 72 Once you reach age 59 1/2, you can make penalty-free withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts. The distributions are still taxed as ordinary income, but over time they will reduce the size of your tax-deferred accounts—and hence your RMDs once you reach age 72 (see \"Now vs. later,\" below). When employing this strategy, it helps to think of it as tax-bracket optimization. For example, if you\\'re a joint filer in the 24% tax bracket and you have $200,000 in taxable income from a business, you could withdraw another $140,000 from your tax-deferred accounts and stay in your current tax bracket. \"The idea is to select a tax bracket that makes the most sense for your circumstances—and then fill up that bracket with distributions from your tax-deferred retirement accounts each year,\" Hayden says. \"Those funds can then be reinvested in a taxable brokerage account, and if invested tax efficiently, could produce very little additional taxable income each year.\" Now vs. later Drawing down tax-deferred accounts without penalty starting at age 59 1/2 can reduce your RMDs starting at age 72—and help keep taxes in check. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Calculations assume a married couple with $200,000 in combined taxable income and $2 million in combined tax-deferred accounts at age 59½. Annual growth of 6% is added to the account balance at the end of each year, and nonportfolio income and tax brackets increase by 2% annually to account for inflation (based on current tax rates). This example is hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. A Roth IRA conversion Another way to optimize your tax bracket and potentially reduce future RMDs is to convert some of your tax-deferred savings to a Roth IRA in the years leading up to age 72, since such accounts aren\\'t subject to RMDs. You\\'ll have to pay tax on the converted amount at the time of the conversion, so it\\'s generally a good idea only if you think your tax bracket in retirement will be equal to or higher than it is now. \"Taxes are historically low, so it\\'s possible they could go up in the future,\" Hayden says. \"But the decision ultimately comes down to whether you\\'re comfortable locking in today\\'s tax rates on the converted funds.\" A qualified charitable distribution A QCD allows you to donate up to $100,000 per year from an IRA directly to charity—and use some or all of those funds to satisfy your IRA RMDs for the year. For example, if your RMD for the year is $100,000 but you need only $50,000 of that, you could donate the remaining $50,000 via a QCD to satisfy the rest of your RMD (see \"Cash vs. QCD,\" below). \"QCDs can be a great tool for philanthropy as well as managing taxable income in retirement,\" Hayden says. \"Just be aware that QCDs are not permitted from 401(k)s or other qualified plans.\" Cash vs. QCD Taking your full RMD and then donating cash could result in a higher tax bill than if you were to give through a QCD. Scenario 1 Take RMD of $100,000 and donate $50,000 in cash Nonportfolio income: $50,000 Annual RMD: + $100,000 QCD: + $0 Pretax income: = $150,000 Itemized deduction: – $50,000 Taxable income: = $100,000 Estimated taxes due: $17,836 Take RMD of $100,000 and donate $50,000 in cash Nonportfolio income: $50,000 Annual RMD: + $100,000 QCD: + $0 Pretax income: = $150,000 Itemized deduction: – $50,000 Taxable income: = $100,000 Estimated taxes due: $17,836 Take RMD of $100,000 and donate $50,000 in cash Nonportfolio income: $50,000 Annual RMD: + $100,000 QCD: + $0 Pretax income: = $150,000 Itemized deduction: – $50,000 Taxable income: = $100,000 Estimated taxes due: $17,836 Scenario 2 Take RMD of $50,000 and donate $50,000 using a QCD Nonportfolio income: $50,000 Annual RMD: + $100,000 QCD: – $50,000 Pretax income: = $100,000 Standard deduction: – $14,700 Taxable income: = $85,300 Estimated taxes due: $14,383 Take RMD of $50,000 and donate $50,000 using a QCD Nonportfolio income: $50,000 Annual RMD: + $100,000 QCD: – $50,000 Pretax income: = $100,000 Standard deduction: – $14,700 Taxable income: = $85,300 Estimated taxes due: $14,383 Take RMD of $50,000 and donate $50,000 using a QCD Nonportfolio income: $50,000 Annual RMD: + $100,000 QCD: – $50,000 Pretax income: = $100,000 Standard deduction: – $14,700 Taxable income: = $85,300 Estimated taxes due: $14,383 Note: This example is hypothetical, for illustrative purposes only, and should not be considered tax advice. Tax calculations are estimated using 2022 federal tax brackets for a single filer, do not reflect state taxes, and assume that 85% of Social Security benefits are taxable. In 2022, the standard deduction for individuals ages 65 and older is $14,700 ($12,950 standard deduction plus $1,750 of additional deductions based on age). When implementing an RMD-reduction strategy, there\\'s no substitute for personalized advice from a tax professional who knows the details of your individual situation. \"A professional can help you anticipate potential challenges and consider how these strategies fit into your overall financial plan,\" Hayden says. 1 Certain qualified plans can allow for those who are still working to forgo RMDs until their employment is terminated.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'We all experience losses in our portfolios, whether because of a market downturn or just lackluster performance. Fortunately, losing investments can have a silver lining. Through tax-loss harvesting, you may be able to use them to lower your tax liability and better position your portfolio. Here are four situations in which it might make sense to sell your losers—and what to consider if you plan to reinvest the proceeds. 1. You want to realize some gains When people talk about the benefits of tax-loss harvesting, it\\'s often in reference to offsetting taxable gains elsewhere in their portfolio. After all, even when the market has had a good run, lifting your holdings, you might still have some stocks that are below where you bought them. If you\\'re looking to lock in some of those gains (aka tax-gain harvesting), selling some of your losers can help minimize your capital gains taxes. Using a tax loss to get a tax break A hypothetical investor who realized $10,000 in short-term capital gains and $15,000 in capital losses could use tax-loss harvesting to reduce her tax bill—this year and in future years. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Assumes a 32% combined federal/state marginal income tax bracket, with short-term capital gains taxed at ordinary income tax rates. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to represent a specific investment product and the example does not reflect the effects of fees. 2. You want to reduce your taxable income If you don\\'t have investment gains to offset, or if you realize more losses than gains, you can use up to $3,000 in losses to reduce your ordinary income this year—and every year thereafter—until the entire loss is accounted for. 3. You need the income There\\'s an adage among traders: Let your winners run. If you don\\'t want to sell your winners prematurely, it might make more sense to generate the necessary income by selling your losers—which may allow you to offset up to $3,000 a year in ordinary income in the process. 4. The investment no longer fits your strategy Regardless of whether an investment has lost or gained value, you should never keep it if it no longer fits your strategy. That said, it can be hard to let go of an investment that’s lost value, thanks to the break-even fallacy, or our instinct to wait to sell an investment until it rebounds to our purchase price. But holding on to the investment in hopes of a turnaround could erode your returns further. Taking the loss could allow you to get your portfolio back on track more quickly—and potentially offset capital gains and/or ordinary income. Other considerations If you\\'ve decided to sell some losers, it\\'s important to understand a few of the applicable tax rules before you act: Short- vs. long-term capital gains Short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary federal income tax rates, which, for many taxpayers, are higher than the long-term capital gains rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income level. Any losses first must be applied to gains of the same type before they can be applied to gains of a different type. For example, if you have short- and long-term gains, first you must use any long-term losses to offset your long-term gains; then you can use any remaining long-term losses to offset your short-term gains. Wash-sale rule If you plan to take a loss and reinvest the proceeds, be mindful of the wash-sale rule: You can\\'t use the losses to offset gains if you purchase the same, or a \"substantially identical\" investment, within 30 days before or after the sale. Unfortunately, there\\'s no clear guidance on what constitutes a substantially identical investment. Stocks are fairly straightforward, but for exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, it\\'s best to err on the side of caution by selecting a fund that tracks a different benchmark or has a markedly different investment mix. A financial planner or qualified tax advisor can help you make the most of any investment losses—without running afoul of the IRS.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Social Security benefits recently received their biggest cost-of-living bump in four decades to help offset the blistering rates of inflation we\\'ve see over the past year. However, there\\'s a chance this adjustment won\\'t go as far you might expect after adjustments to Medicare premiums and potential taxes are taken into account. Here, we\\'ll look at how these increases work and why some retirees may not see much upside. What happened? The Social Security Administration increased monthly benefits by 5.9% for this year to help retirees retain more of their spending power in response to the surge in consumer prices we\\'ve seen in the pandemic era. The increase will boost the average benefit by about $93 a month, or more than $1,100 a year, though the actual amount will vary depending on your 2021 benefit. It was the largest such increase since July 1982. How are these increases calculated? The SSA bases these adjustments on the Bureau of Labor Statistics\\' Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), using data from the third quarter of previous year. The CPI-W tracks the spending patterns of urban wage earners—covering items such as housing, transportation, food and beverages, and medical care. One potential limitation here is that inflation rates rose sharply after the third quarter, from 5.4% in September to 6.2% in October, 6.8% in November, and 7% in December. If the rate of price increases stays high, even this year\\'s historically large cost-of-living bump might not feel like much help. There\\'s also some debate over whether the way urban workers spend their money is an accurate way to measure the cost of living for seniors. The government actually tracks a separate inflation measure for Americans age 62 or older, which places more weight on medical care and housing, and Congress is considering a bill to make the switch to a more representative index. Some studies have shown that cost-of-living increases using that measure could be slightly larger, but for now CPI-W remains the official source for cost-of-living adjustments. What about Medicare? Another thing to keep in mind is that inflation will also help push the standard Medicare Part B premium from $148.50 per month in 2021 to $170.10 per month this year. Medicare Part B premiums are generally deducted from your Social Security benefits. Although premiums are up less than $22 a month, that still represents a significant bite out of the annual cost-of-living boost. How might this affect taxes? Even though benefits are rising, the IRS rules governing how much of your benefits are taxable will stay the same—meaning more people could end up having to pay taxes on their Social Security payments. As things stand now, if a couple filing jointly has \"combined income\"—which is calculated by taking your adjusted gross income, plus half of your Social Security benefits, plus non-taxable interest—of $32,000 to $44,000, then up to half of their benefits will be taxed at their regular income tax rate. If their income is above $44,000, up to 85% of their benefits will be taxed. (For single filers, the numbers are $25,000-$34,000, and anything above $34,000.) If these limits seem low, that’s because they haven’t been adjusted since the early \\'90s. What does this mean in practical terms? Imagine a retired couple $300,000 in tax-deferred savings and combined monthly Social Security benefits of $2,599 (according to the SSA, that was the average amount for couples in 2021). If they used a simplified version of the 4% rule to draw from their tax-deferred savings, without any adjustments for inflation, their combined income would have been $43,188. That would mean up to half of their Social Security benefits would be taxed, as they would still be just shy of line beyond which the taxable portion would rise to as much as 85%. However, even if they changed nothing else, the benefits increase this year would boost their total income above $45,000, putting them over that line and exposing them to a potentially much larger tax bill. This is just a basic example, of course. A couple that had done some advance tax planning and converted some of their tax-deferred savings to an after-tax Roth account would be able to draw from those savings tax-free, assuming they met the holding requirements. Careful management of their cash flow after accounting for IRS-mandated required minimum distributions from their tax-deferred accounts could also help them stay below the Social Security tax thresholds. Social Security can be a complex topic. If you have questions about how inflation and cost-of-living increases might affect your income strategy or taxes, talk with your financial advisor.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My husband and I just came back from such an amazing vacation in Hawaii that we're considering retiring there—or possibly to another warm climate. Our kids are grown, we've paid off our mortgage on our current home, and are both in good health, but we worry about whether we can afford such a big move... to say nothing of whether we'd really be happy. Your thoughts? —A Reader Dear Reader, I like the way you're thinking—for many reasons. Too often we get stuck in our old way of doing things, regardless of whether those patterns and habits are positive. But one of the best things about retirement is that it can be an opportunity to rethink just about everything in your life—from the way you spend your time to where you choose to live. Of course, I can't comment on whether moving to Hawaii would be the best choice for you, but kudos for thinking broadly. One of the keys to making a decision—and feeling confident in that choice—will be to continue to talk out your options as a couple, analyzing both the financial and lifestyle implications. The more you're both involved in the discussions and analysis, the more likely you are to ultimately land in a good place. Start by brainstorming lifestyle choices My first suggestion for anyone who wants to explore their retirement options is to start by thinking big. Most often we have to make tradeoffs, but for now try not to rule anything out as you ask yourself some key questions: How close do you want to live near family and friends? What's your idea of an ideal community, both in terms of people and activities? What's your ideal climate, and how important is that? Will you be near top-notch doctors and hospitals? What activities are most important, whether that's cultural (theatre, museums, music), religious (church, mosque, synagogue,) or physical (golf, gardening, skiing)? How important are other support systems such as public transportation or an active senior center? Will you be looking for part-time work or volunteer opportunities? Layer on housing choices Once you've given your lifestyle choices some thought, it's time to focus on your options for housing. Stay in brainstorm mode for a little longer as you allow yourself to think freely. You'll have plenty of time later on to narrow down your choices. Is it more appealing to stay put in retirement or do you have a hankering to try someplace new? If you want to explore moving, that opens up another set of options: Do you want to try a new community, or simply a new home? Do you prefer to buy or rent? There are pros and cons to both choices: more autonomy and control as a buyer vs. less responsibility for upkeep and the ability to easily move if your circumstances change as a renter. What appeals most, city or country? Mountains or beach? A single-family home, a condominium, an apartment, or perhaps a unit in a retirement community, or even a continuing care facility? Or in your wildest dreams would you want something even more unusual, such as a house boat? Switch over to the practical Once you've allowed yourself to think big, it's time to switch gears and get a bit more practical about finances and logistics. I'm absolutely not suggesting that you abandon your dreams, but it's also essential to know if your plan is financially tenable and physically doable. The last thing you want to do is overextend yourself, adding stress to your retirement years. If you don't have a detailed retirement plan that includes a realistic estimate of your retirement income (from your investments, pensions and Social Security), now is the time to do those calculations. On the spending side of the equation, compare all costs (current and future) as you consider different options. You may save money in some areas by relocating but have bigger (or brand new) costs in other areas of your budget. One state might not have an income tax, for example, but home prices could be higher. Property taxes could be lower but you may face higher homeowner's insurance premiums. As you do your analysis, include everything from fixed expenses for things like housing (mortgage or rent, property taxes, state taxes, utilities, maintenance, renovations), insurance, healthcare (Medicare plus additional expenses that Medicare doesn't cover) to discretionary expenses for recreation, travel (especially if you're far from your family), and potentially the need for extra help or ongoing care. A financial planner can help you crunch all the numbers. Also do a gut check on the lifestyle side. If you move to Hawaii, will you regret being further away from your family? Will there be enough activities to keep you fulfilled? Will the high cost of living force you to scrimp on other extras? Most likely you won't be able to get everything you want, but you can hopefully satisfy the most important aspects of your dream. Some final thoughts My last piece of advice is to give yourself all the time you need to make your decision. This is not a time to feel rushed. You might even want to do a test run before a big move, renting in a new community for a few months as you continue to feel your way. Whatever you ultimately decide, I admire your sense of adventure. Don't let that fade. Retirement can be a wonderful new chapter in your life as long as you plan and protect your finances at the same time that you live your dream. And ultimately, this doesn't have to be a permanent decision; life can continue to evolve in a positive way, provided, of course, that you continue to carefully think through both your financial and lifestyle choices.

       "   'abstract': 'How couples can be more productive—and keep the peace—when discussing financial matters.',\n",
       "   'content': 'When Schwab senior financial planner Jim Kunkel began working with a newly engaged couple, he noticed something concerning: One carried a fair amount of credit card debt while the other had an abundance of cash on hand. “They approached their finances in totally different ways, and it was quickly becoming a source of tension,” Jim says. After helping them through some tough conversations about their respective financial values, Jim steered the couple toward a compromise: Together they would retire the debt and then commit to a set of mutually agreed upon savings goals, which included paying off any credit balances each month. “This couple was a real success story because they began a dialogue so early in their relationship,” Jim says. That said, even longtime couples on the same page about their broader financial ambitions can disagree about how best to reach those benchmarks—to say nothing of more mundane money matters. In fact, a 2021 poll by the American Institute of CPAs by the American Institute of CPAs found that financial decisions were a source of tension in 73% of married or cohabitating respondents. “Every couple should prioritize conversations about money, especially as they relate to shared finances and goals,” says Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, CFP®, president of Charles Schwab Foundation and managing director of Schwab Community Services at Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. “No matter how close you are, money issues have a way of creeping into the best of relationships.” Here are three common challenges that can upend a couple’s finances—and potentially their relationship—along with tips for resolving such conflicts in a productive, nonconfrontational way. 1. Different financial values The conflict: At the heart of many couples’ financial conflicts is a fundamental difference in their relationships with money. “If you grew up in a household that struggled to make ends meet, for example, you might be a staunch saver because you know what it’s like to go without,” says Joanna Heckman, a Certified Financial Planner™ professional with Schwab. “If your partner grew up in a free-spending family, on the other hand, he or she might feel frustrated by a more frugal lifestyle.” Likewise, some people are perfectly comfortable taking on debt, while others resist it, which can create conflict when it comes to buying, say, a new car. “When your values differ, you’re more likely to be at odds when it comes to making even relatively small financial decisions,” Jim says. The resolution: “A successful financial plan can be a tool to encourage a couple to meet in the middle,” says Jim. While you and your partner don’t have to be equally involved in your finances, you should both know the big picture—things like net worth, cash flow, debt, insurance, investment accounts, retirement savings, and estate planning. Along with examining the hard numbers, creating a plan frequently reveals deeper questions about your goals as a couple and how money can help you attain them. Start by probing what past experiences may be influencing your partner’s approach to the present. “The key is not only to listen but to be receptive to the other person’s perspective,” Joanna says. From there, you can dive into where your values align, where they differ, and how you can leverage your separate views for the good of your shared finances. “Finding common ground is almost always the quickest way out of a conflict,” Carrie adds. See more Onward articles. Go to Onward hub 2. Income inequality The conflict: When one partner earns significantly more than the other, it can trigger feelings of entitlement, inadequacy, and resentment—none of which makes for a harmonious relationship. “A lower-earning partner often feels guilty for spending money, even when it’s on something for the household,” Jim says. “Conversely, a higher earner might feel entitled to spend more because they earn more, potentially fueling feelings of second-class citizenship for their partner.” The resolution: Start by acknowledging the disparity and its causes. “As we all know, hard work and income don’t always go hand in hand,” Carrie says. “A teacher might work as hard as a CEO, and acknowledging that fact can go a long way toward keeping the peace.” Also consider contributing toward shared expenses in proportion to your incomes. “If one partner earns 25% more than the other, for example, he or she could contribute 25% more toward your household expenses,” Joanna suggests. Finally, consider making a list of all the ways you and your partner contribute to the relationship and the household. “Your partner’s value is more than the sum of her or his income, and so is yours,” Carrie says. 3. Financial infidelity The conflict: According to a 2018 Harris Poll conducted for the National Endowment for Financial Education, 41% of American adults admit to concealing certain purchases or lying to their partners about debt. The reasons range from protecting privacy to embarrassment to fear of disapproval. “ This is a particularly difficult conversation to have, but once all the details are on the table, you can explore the ‘whys’ behind your or your partner’s actions,” Carrie says. The resolution: Whether it’s about an extravagant purchase, a large debt, or someone dropping the ball, focus on resolving the problem at hand and not repeating it in the future. “Getting to the root of such actions is generally more productive than leveling accusations,” Jim says. Having an unbiased moderator can help mediate the discussion and arrive at an agreeable outcome. “People tend to be on their best behavior when they meet a financial advisor, which can help take some of the emotion out of the discussion,” Jim says. “When you’re working as a team, it’s a lot easier to accomplish your goals than by working on your own.” Act with intention Moving forward, agree to talk things out as soon as either of you has a concern. “If you let things build up, they’re more likely to blow up,” Joanna says. “And money matters, in particular, tend to compound rather than resolve themselves over time.” For most couples, having frank conversations with the help of a financial professional can provide a strong foundation for tackling even the toughest topics. Also recognize that many financial conflicts won’t be resolved in a single sit-down. “The important thing is to keep communicating,” Joanna adds. “These are rarely one-and-done conversations.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Diversification isn\\'t just for your investment portfolio. If you\\'re actively saving for retirement, it\\'s also a good idea to diversify how and when your savings will be taxed. Doing so can help you successfully navigate two unknowns in retirement: How much of your income will be taxable? You need to consider not just your retirement savings but also Social Security, pensions, nonretirement investments, and other potential sources of income. What will your tax rate be after you retire? Today\\'s rates are relatively low by historical standards, and it\\'s conceivable they could rise before or during your golden years. Given these unknowns, it\\'s still possible to plan for a potentially better tax outcome. \"One approach is to use accounts with a variety of tax treatments so you can better control your taxable income in retirement,\" says Rob Williams, CFP®, CRPC®, and managing director of financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. The big four Broadly speaking, you have four account types at your disposal, each with its own unique tax advantages: 1. Tax-deferred accounts Contributions to these accounts—which include 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and traditional IRAs—generally reduce your taxable income dollar for dollar in the year you make the contribution. What\\'s more, pretax contributions and gains aren\\'t usually taxed until retirement,1 at which point withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax rates. You can\\'t leave your savings in these accounts forever, though: The IRS requires you to take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your tax-deferred savings accounts each year starting at age 72 unless you\\'re still working and contributing to your current employer\\'s plan.2 2. Roth accounts Unlike tax-deferred accounts, contributions to Roth 401(k)s and Roth IRAs are made with after-tax dollars, so they won\\'t reduce your current taxable income. But when you withdraw the money in retirement, you won\\'t owe taxes on appreciation, income, or withdrawals.3 A Roth IRA is exempt from RMDs (unless you inherit it), while a Roth 401(k) is not—although you can still avoid RMDs by rolling it into a Roth IRA when you retire. 3. Taxable accounts These traditional bank and brokerage accounts are also funded with after-tax dollars. For brokerage accounts, you can sell securities and contribute or withdraw money at any time and for any reason without penalty. Any taxable investment income is taxed in the year it\\'s earned, and investments sold for a profit are subject to capital gains taxes. If you sell an investment for a loss, you may be able to use it to offset any gains—and/or up to $3,000 of ordinary income. These accounts are also exempt from RMDs. 4. Health savings accounts Although not traditionally considered retirement accounts, health savings accounts (HSAs) can be an effective savings vehicle (if your employer offers one, and you\\'re covered by an eligible high-deductible health plan). Contributions reduce your taxable income up to annual limits, investments grow tax-free, and you pay no tax on withdrawals for qualified medical expenses. Once you reach age 65, withdrawals for nonmedical purposes will be taxed as ordinary income.4 HSAs are also exempt from RMDs. Tax diversification in action So, what\\'s the right mix of retirement accounts for you? \"That depends on several factors, including your current marginal tax rate, your tax rate in retirement, and how much flexibility you\\'d like when making withdrawals in retirement,\" says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, and director of tax planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Nevertheless, there are some basic guidelines you can consider when deciding which retirement accounts to fund first: Capture your match If your employer offers matching contributions to your retirement account, your first priority should be to save enough to get the full match. \"That\\'s free money, and you\\'d be ill-advised to leave it on the table,\" Rob says. Consider an HSA \"We\\'re all likely to have increased medical expenses in retirement,\" Hayden notes. \"So, why not pay for them with tax-free dollars?\" In 2022, individuals can contribute up to $3,650, families can contribute up to $7,300, and account holders age 55 or older can contribute an additional $1,000. Employers sometimes provide matching contributions, though they\\'ll count against the annual limits. Maximize your tax-advantaged savings Next, consider an appropriate combination of tax-deferred and Roth accounts, depending in large part on your current tax bracket: If you\\'re in a lower tax bracket (0%, 10%, or 12%), consider maxing out your Roth accounts. \"There\\'s a chance your tax bracket in retirement will be equal to or higher than it is today, particularly when you consider that tax rates are at the lowest levels we\\'ve seen in decades,\" Rob says. \"Workers early in their careers, in particular, may be in a lower tax bracket than they will be later in life.\" If you\\'re in a middle tax bracket (22% or 24%), consider splitting your retirement savings between tax-deferred and Roth accounts. \"It can be especially difficult for people in the middle tax brackets to predict their future tax rates, but if you contribute to both types of tax-advantaged accounts you may alleviate some of that uncertainty,\" Hayden stresses. If the majority of your workplace savings are in a traditional 401(k), for example, you might opt to diversify with a Roth 401(k), if your employer offers one. If you\\'re in a higher tax bracket (32%, 35%, or 37%), there\\'s a good possibility your tax rate in retirement will be the same as or lower than it is today, so maximizing your tax-deferred accounts might make the most sense. Invest tax-efficiently in a brokerage account If you still have more left to save after you\\'ve taken the steps above, consider investing in a traditional brokerage account. Income generated in these accounts is generally taxable, but there are strategies you can employ to improve their tax efficiency, such as: Holding appreciated investments for more than a year so you can take advantage of long-term capital gains rates, which range from 0% to 20%, depending on your income. Limiting investment trades to avoid unnecessary taxes on your returns. Depending on your tax bracket and how much you trade, each trade can potentially create a \"tax drag\" that can reduce your after-tax returns by 1% to 3% annually.5 Compounded over 30 years, overtrading could result in a lot of returns lost to taxes. Considering tax-efficient investments—such as exchange-traded funds, index mutual funds, and tax-managed funds—which by and large don\\'t create as many taxable distributions as actively managed funds. Opting for tax-advantaged municipal bonds, especially if you\\'re in a high tax bracket. The interest paid on such bonds is typically free from federal taxes and, if issued in your home state, is generally free from state and local taxes as well. Consider a Roth conversion If your income precludes you from contributing to a Roth IRA,6 one potential option is a Roth conversion. With this strategy, you convert all or a portion of funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and pay ordinary income taxes on the converted amount in the year of the conversion. \"Despite the additional taxes, a Roth conversion can help diversify a mostly tax-deferred portfolio,\" Rob explains. However, \"the conversion amount is considered income, which could nudge you into a higher bracket if you\\'re not careful,\" Hayden warns. \"That\\'s why many people opt to perform several Roth conversions over multiple tax years.\" If you\\'re unsure how much to convert in a given year, a tax professional can help you decide. \"Anticipating future tax rates is always a bit of a guessing game,\" Rob says. \"But with a number of account types at your disposal, there\\'s potential to build in flexibility and a surprising level of control over future tax bills.\" 1Tax-deferred withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty, if taken prior to age 59½. Withdrawals for birth and/or adoption expenses can be made up to a certain limit without a penalty. 2If you continue to work past age 72, and do not own more than 5% of the business you work for, most plans allow you to postpone RMDs from your current—but not a prior—employer\\'s plan until no later than April 1 of the year after you finally stop working. 3Roth withdrawals are tax-free provided the account holder is over age 59½ and has held the account for five years or more. 4HSA withdrawals used for nonmedical purposes before age 65 may be subject to ordinary income tax plus a 20% penalty. 5Robert D Arnott, Andrew L Berkin, and Paul Bouchey, \"Is Your Alpha Big Enough to Cover Its Taxes? Revisited,\" Investments & Wealth Monitor, 2011, pp. 6–10, 20. 6For 2022, to contribute to a Roth IRA, single filers must have a modified adjusted gross income of less than $144,000, and contributions are reduced starting at $129,000; for those married and filing jointly, the figures are $214,000 and $204,000.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Having relationship problems with your money? Here are ideas on how to show your investments some love.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, Today let’s talk about an important relationship you may be hesitant to discuss. You know, the one you can’t live without, even though it may sometimes cause headaches and heartaches. —No, I'm not talking about you and your partner, I'm talking about the relationship between you and your investments. Sure, you’ve made some money mistakes in the past. We all have. And we’re all trying to have a healthy relationship with our finances and break destructive habits. So here’s some friendly advice from someone who over the years has not only heard tales of joy about investing but also stories of woe, worry and sorrow—and a few ideas on how you can show your investments some love. 1) It’s not your investments—it’s you As with every relationship, you have to take some responsibility for how it's going. Are you disappointed in your returns? Look at your own behavior. Most investors receive less than market returns. Why? Because all too often they chase after the hottest thing, jumping in and out of the market, rather than staying the course. If you want to be more a successful investor, you need to have a plan and stick with it. Investing is a long-term commitment. 2) Get serious Investing isn't a game to be played lightly. There's real money at stake. If you want the potential for serious returns, you need to be serious about what you're doing. Don't be satisfied with the superficial or taken in by the glitz. Rather, get to know an investment before you commit. Do your research. Read the prospectus. Make sure it’s a good fit for your asset allocation. Remember, investing isn't a fling. It's something you want to be a part of your life for the long-term. 3) Leave the past behind I should've bought TESLA when it went public…saved that raise…I should never have taken on that car payment… We all have money regrets. But rehashing the past is pointless unless you can learn from it—and change your course. Wish you had invested differently? Take a look at your goals and timeline. Want to save more? Make a budget and stick to it. Need to get out of debt? Create a realistic repayment plan. As they say in investing, past performance is no guarantee of future results. In the same way, obsessing over past mistakes can cause you more harm than good. Better to get over it and move on—with a new plan of action. 4) Pay attention It's often ignoring the little things that can ruin a perfectly good relationship—as well as the not- so-little things. With investing, you need to pay attention to essentials like your expenses. They may seem small, but they can add up. Bigger things like changes in your risk tolerance and time horizon definitely shouldn't be ignored. Plus, you need to check in periodically to make sure you're on track both with your savings and your goals. That doesn't mean you have to constantly monitor your account balance or spend hours watching the markets. But if you don't give your investments enough attention, you might be caught off guard when they go off course. 5) Stop worrying about what other people think Your relationship with your investments is unique. It's about your goals, your needs and your wants. If you're right for each other, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. Whether you made X percent more or less than your friend is irrelevant. The most important thing is whether or not you're able to reach your goals—not someone else’s. FOMO and social media can distract you from focusing on what's right for your situation. So swipe right on friends who encourage you to follow your own plan—and ghost anyone who tries to tell you to invest in something that doesn't fit your goals. No matter what others are doing, invest for yourself and what you care about most. 6) Shed the baggage Your first relationship is rarely the one that lasts forever. Finding the perfect match takes experience. The same goes for investing. Bitcoin curious? When you’re just starting out, you often experiment, trying to find what's right for you. This can result in owning a bunch of random mutual funds, ETFs and individual stocks rather than having a well-thought-out portfolio that's a good match for your goals and feelings about risk. So take an honest look at what's working and what's not. Get rid of investments that don’t fit in or support your goals. It's often better to cut your losses by rebalancing, rethinking your asset allocation and timeline—and starting fresh. 7) Find a new BFF (best financial friend) A little outside perspective can help you see your problems—and solutions—more clearly. So seek out help when you need it. There's plenty of online investing information available. But often there's nothing like expressing your concerns to someone who is knowledgeable and willing to listen. This could be a trusted friend or family member, or an investment professional. And don't forget about your spouse or partner. Money is notorious for causing personal problems. Talking openly and honestly about your financial concerns may help strengthen both your personal and investing relationships. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'The speculative exuberance around special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) seems to be over, but investors still have questions about them.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) have been around for decades, functioning as vehicles for bringing companies public. Until 2020, SPACs—also known as blank-check companies—weren't nearly as popular or common as the traditional initial public offering (IPO) process. Yet, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic—which ushered in an influx of new retail traders and investors, along with the unearthing of several speculative segments of the market—SPACs gained immense popularity. Despite a boom-bust cycle already having played out in terms of SPAC issuance, investors are still left with several questions regarding them, not least being details around historical performance and potential risks. They are incredibly complex vehicles and differ widely in size, structure, and quality. A faster track to public markets SPACs generally offer a less arduous path for companies that wish to go public. They are created by a sponsor—ranging from a private equity firm to a former corporate executive—who works with an underwriter to bring the blank-check company public. Money is raised in a public stock offering and the SPAC trades on an exchange with the intent of finding a target company with which to merge. If and when a merger is completed, the SPAC takes the identity and ticker of the target company. One of the main advantages for target companies—and effectively, SPACs—is the ability to talk about the future and make predictions, which is prohibited in the traditional IPO process. That is a particularly attractive proposition for SPACs that are hunting for innovators and disruptors. Also of interest to target companies is the lack of necessity for roadshows (a key part of the traditional IPO process), which typically consist of several meetings with institutional investors and are meant to secure capital. With SPACs, capital is already raised by a sponsor in one vehicle, making the match process with a target company a bit easier. For the individual investor, SPACs offer a direct opportunity for access to new companies—which has historically been reserved for larger institutions and hedge funds. There is also an attractive affordability trait. In most cases, investors can purchase one unit of a blank-check firm for $10, which consists of a common share and a fraction of a warrant (which gives the right to buy more shares at a specified price in the future). The capital aggregated by the SPAC is invested in Treasury bills until a target company is found, by which time it is deployed to complete the merger process. Fee structures vary but, in general, the sponsor's equity stake amounts to 20%; so, after banking fees, the cost to public investors at the time of the SPAC's IPO, and/or merger with a target company, there are many times when the costs associated with SPACs can be much higher than traditional IPOs. Measuring risk Despite offering a more efficient route to public markets, SPACs still carry a set of risks that investors should be aware of. Many have experienced significant bouts of volatility throughout their lifespans, with much stemming from excitement over a sponsor (be it a celebrity or well-known private equity firm), or hype over a potential merger. In both cases, some SPACs have seen their share prices triple in value in a matter of days or weeks, only to swiftly fall back to—or, in some cases, below—their IPO prices. Rapid and large price swings warrant an extra degree of caution because of the lack of information associated with SPACs. Given they are purely aggregators of cash, price action cannot be tied to any fundamentals (such as earnings streams) until a merger is completed. This is one of the key reasons several SPACs have seen deteriorating performance, and reinforces the importance of performing due diligence on sponsors and the target industry of interest. Another risk worth considering is a SPAC's failure to fulfill its goal of finding a merger target—forcing it to liquidate. In general, SPACs have two years to complete a merger; if they don't, they liquidate and investors get their pro-rata share of the aggregate value of the SPAC. This is a rising risk, along with the inability of new SPACs to enter a flooded market. As of early May 2022, $17 billion worth of deal value (equating to at least 63 SPACs) was aborted (per Bloomberg data), signaling investor exhaustion. Lastly, the regulatory environment may continue to pose some challenges in the future. With the pickup in speculative trading activity over the past year, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sharpened its focus on SPACs. In March 2022, the SEC issued new suggested guidance for SPACs, aimed at enhancing protection for investors. The proposals center on transparency and accountability. Among other things, under the new proposal, SPAC sponsors would be subject to additional disclosures regarding transactions; underwriters would be subject to increased liability; and the ability for SPACs to make long-term projections about future performance would be restricted. To some extent, the SPAC market was weakening prior to the arrival of this proposal. An April 2021 report from the SEC hinted at changing the way warrants are accounted for—as liabilities vs. equities. That alone pushed over 100 SPACs to restate past financial statements and caused a sharp pause in new issuance. Measuring performance In addition to risks, central to investors' focus is SPACs' performance. As mentioned earlier, a boom-bust scenario has already occurred for issuance. SPACs surged in popularity in 2020—and given the rash of issuance, so did their share of overall IPO activity (both in terms of total deal value and the number of companies), as you can see in the chart below. By February 2021—the peak in activity—SPAC value accounted for half of overall IPO value in the United States. As of April 2022, their share has collapsed back to around 10%. The SPAC boom has faded Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 4/30/2022. Performance has largely followed the path of issuance activity. For myriad reasons, several speculative pockets of the market gained steam in the latter half of 2020—not least because of the ample liquidity environment (courtesy of both fiscal and monetary aid) in the wake of the pandemic, heightened interest in day trading, and incredibly swift recovery in stocks from the S&P 500's low on March 23rd, 2020. Looking at performance since the middle of 2020 (when many frothy segments of the market started to rally), SPACs across the board—measured by the ISPAC Index—doubled by February 2021. Those that had already found a target with which to merge—measured by the De-SPAC Index—saw smaller relative gains of 60%. As you can see in the next chart, though, the peak in the frenzy looks to be behind us, as gains have completely faded for the ISPAC Index and turned into severe declines. Even worse has been performance for companies in the De-SPAC Index, which have seen their value fall by 75% from the peak in 2021 as of early May 2022. Performance has collapsed Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 5/6/2022. Both indices indexed to 100 at 4/30/2020. ISPAC Index is a passive rules-based index that tracks the performance of the newly listed special purpose acquisition companies ex-warrant and initial public offerings derived from SPACs. De-SPAC Index is a rules-based index developed to capture the performance of a group of 25 companies that came public as the result of a business combination with a SPAC. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Traditional IPO performance is a bit more difficult to track over time, given the massive number of companies that have gone the standard route. Yet one can look to the Renaissance IPO Index, which measures performance of newer IPOs and dates back to 2009. Returns have been impressive, as the index has gained over 250% since its inception. However, the run has not been uninterrupted by volatility, as evidenced by sharp drawdowns in 2015-2016 (-36%), 2020 (-38%), 2021 (-29%), and 2022 (-45%). Conclusion The speculative exuberance phase for SPACs looks to have ended, but that doesn't discount the reality that many are still active in their search for target companies. Given the playing field is still flooded with pursuant SPACs and demand for targets remains strong, key to watch will be the sustainability and longevity of merger activity. The severe drop in overall performance since the beginning of 2021 shows investors are no longer willing to pay higher premiums, the meager performance of SPACs with deals announced this year suggests that hype around deal activity has faded, and the substantial number of SPACs pulled from the market signals investors and sponsors have lost a significant amount of confidence. Even though both deal activity and performance for SPACs have fallen considerably, interest among investors remains. Moments of truth are likely to emerge this year for several companies that are still aiming to find merger targets. Many have already come to light given a high redemption rate—which measures the number of shareholders demanding their money back instead of funding mergers— but with market volatility spiking to a significant degree in 2022, the Fed raising rates, and myriad asset classes entering bear market territory, the best days for SPACs in the current cycle look to be behind us. As with any investment, risks associated with those SPACs—and the broader segment—should be carefully analyzed.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The Federal Reserve is expected to starting hiking short-term rates at its March meeting. But how fast will the pace be?',\n",
       "   'content': 'The Federal Reserve has set in motion a plan to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. Based on comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell following the central bank\\'s most recent policymaking meeting, \"lift off\"—as the first rate hike of the cycle is called—will almost certainly occur at its upcoming March 15th-16th policy meeting. Quantitative tightening, the process of reducing the amount of bonds the Fed holds on its balance sheet, is likely to start soon after the start of rate hikes. The bond market has taken the Fed’s signal and run with it. The market is pricing in five rate increases of 25 basis points each, which would put the federal funds rate at 1.25% by the end of the year (a basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point). That\\'s a huge jump from where the market was priced just a few months ago, and there are plenty of predictions that rates could move even higher. The bond market is now pricing in five rate hikes this year Source: Bloomberg. Data as of 2/1/2022. WIRP Estimated number of Moves Priced in for the U.S. - Futures Model (US0ANM DEC2022 Index). The World Interest Rate Probability (WIRP) data represents the estimated number of moves priced into the current forward-curve structure for the United States using the futures model. Flight plan is still pending While it\\'s clear that the Fed is anxious to initiate a new tightening cycle, we think it\\'s premature to forecast such a rapid pace of rate hikes without more clarity about its plans to reduce the amount of bonds the Fed holds on its balance sheet. The Fed released general principles for quantitative tightening, but hasn’t spelled out a clear plan yet. The Fed\\'s balance sheet has ballooned to more than $8 trillion Source: Bloomberg. Weekly data as of 1/26/2022. Reserve Balance Wednesday Close for Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes, Treasury Bonds, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), and Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). Allowing bonds to mature without reinvestment can have a similar impact as hiking rates in terms of the impact on the availability of funds to the banking system. The Fed has indicated it prefers using the federal funds rate as its primary tool to set policy, but given the size of its current bond holdings, it’s possible that quantitative tightening will play a bigger role in the Fed\\'s plans in this cycle than it did in the last cycle. That could mean fewer rate hikes than anticipated. Economists have estimated that a $600 billion reduction in the balance sheet is the equivalent of about a 25-basis-point rate increase.1 Moreover, amid the volatility in the economic data, there are already signs that the economy is slowing down as we enter 2022. Inventories that were built up late last year likely will be drawn down in the first half of this year, while the pace of manufacturing orders has started to decline. Consumer spending has slowed as pent-up demand for goods has been met and savings have been drawn down. In 2022, fiscal policy will provide less of a boost to incomes, as higher mortgage rates should cool down the housing market.

Expect turbulence to continue Fed Chair Powell has indicated that policy plans are not on a set course, with the Fed preferring to take a \"nimble\" approach. However, the markets have discounted a significant tightening in policy for this year. The telltale signs of tight policy expectations are already showing up in the markets. The yield curve has flattened, with short-term rates moving up sharply relative to long-term rates. The spread between 2- and 10-year Treasury yields has fallen, flattening the curve Source: Bloomberg. Daily data as of 2/2/2022. Note: The rates are comprised of Market Matrix U.S. Generic spread rates (USYC2Y10). This spread is a calculated Bloomberg yield spread that replicates selling the current 2-year U.S. Treasury note and buying the current 10-year U.S. Treasury note, then factoring the differences by 100. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Real Treasury yields—adjusted for inflation expectations—have risen steeply in the past few months. The yields are still negative, but well off the levels seen late last year. Negative real yields are usually associated with periods of weak economic growth and high global savings, where demand for safe securities exceeds the supply. Investors accept the low yields relative to inflation because they expect inflation to fall, or because they are seeking safety over returns. With the economy improving and the Fed ending its bond-buying program, it’s not surprising that real yields are moving up. That suggests that riskier segments of the market, where investors may have stretched to capture positive real yields—such as high-yield bonds—may underperform as after-inflation returns on Treasuries become more attractive by comparison. Real yields are still negative but are rising Source: Bloomberg. Daily data as of 2/2/2022. US Generic Govt TII 10 Yr (USGGT10Y INDEX) and US Generic Govt TII 5 Yr (USGGT05Y INDEX). The U.S. dollar has spiked to its highest level in two years, reflecting the high level of U.S. short-term yields relative to yields in other major developed countries. The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index has risen Source: Bloomberg, using daily data as of 2/1/2022. Option-adjusted spreads (OAS) are quoted as a fixed spread, or differential, over U.S. Treasury issues. OAS is a method used in calculating the relative value of a fixed income security containing an embedded option, such as a borrower\\'s option to prepay a loan. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Finally, the recent shakeout in speculative areas of the equity market is also a sign that markets expect tighter monetary policy to have a negative effect on the returns in highly leveraged investments. Destination neutral In the long run, the Fed\\'s goal is to sets policy rate at \"neutral,\" a level that allows the economy to grow at its potential without generating inflation. The Fed\\'s estimate of the neutral level of the federal funds rate is 2.5%. However, it only touched that level once in the past decade—in 2018—and that didn’t last long. While it\\'s possible that the neutral rate has moved up or that Fed will need to raise the federal funds above the neutral rate due to high inflation, such a move would raise the risk of leading to a recession. With the markets now priced for the fed funds rate above 2% over the next years, it has gone a long way to discounting a cycle of Fed tightening. What to do while waiting for liftoff We continue to see upward pressure on yields as the Fed\\'s liftoff date approaches. We wouldn\\'t fight the trend, preferring to keep the average duration in portfolios low. However, as the Fed\\'s plans become clearer, we are looking for potential opportunities to invest in intermediate- to longer-term bonds at higher yields. Buy-and-hold investors with a long-term time horizon can consider adding duration in high-quality bonds, such as Treasuries and investment-grade corporate and municipal bonds. 1 \"The Hutchins Center Explains: Quantitative Easing,\" The Brookings Institution, January 21, 2015.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I turn 65 in a few months and will be retiring. What do I need to know when I sign up for Medicare? Medicare Advantage? —A Reader Dear Reader, Congratulations on your upcoming retirement. The decisions you make about Medicare are critical when it comes to getting the right kind of health coverage in place. While Medicare won’t cover all your health costs (it generally covers about two-thirds), it\\'s an important benefit you should take time to understand. There are a lot of details that I won\\'t be able to cover in this column, but here are three key decisions you may have to make when enrolling. Step 1. Choose Original Medicare or Medicare Advantage This is the biggest decision when signing up for Medicare. You can get Medicare benefits either through Original Medicare (sometimes called Traditional Medicare) or a Medicare Advantage plan. Which one is right for you depends on your situation and preferences. Here are some things to consider: Original Medicare contains Part A, which provides inpatient/hospital coverage and Part B, which covers outpatient/doctor care. Under Original Medicare, the government pays directly for the health care services you receive. You can see any doctor and hospital that takes Medicare anywhere in the country without prior authorization from Medicare or your primary care doctor. Medicare Advantage (sometimes called Medicare Part C or MA plans) is an alternative to Original Medicare. It covers all services that Parts A and B offer through private insurance companies approved by Medicare. It often includes additional benefits such as dental care, eyeglasses, wellness programs and usually drug coverage. However, Medicare Advantage plans frequently have network restrictions, meaning you’ll likely be more limited in your choice of doctors and providers. You also may have to go through a primary care physician to see a specialist. You can see providers outside of the network but it will cost more. With Medicare Advantage, you have to choose a specific plan when you enroll, so make sure to check and compare available providers and facilities in your area—as well as plan costs such as premiums and co-payments. You can do this at medicare.gov. If you\\'ve decided on a Medicare Advantage plan, you\\'re pretty much done. But if you choose Original Medicare you have a couple more important decisions to make. Step 2. Choose a Medigap policy As I mentioned, Medicare doesn\\'t cover everything, so if you\\'re going with Original Medicare, you should generally purchase a Medigap policy to supplement your coverage. Medigap can help you cover out-of-pocket expenses including copayments, deductibles, and co-insurance. There are 10 types of Medigap plans with standardized benefits, all offered through private insurance companies. Premiums and out-of-pocket expenses will depend on the type of Medigap plan and insurance provider you choose. (Just a reminder: With Medicare Advantage you don’t need Medigap.) Step 3. Choose Medicare Part D—Prescription Drug Coverage If you choose Original Medicare, you should also select Part D unless you have other drug coverage, for instance through an employer, that is comparable or \"creditable\" (coverage that is, on average, as good as or better than the basic Part D benefit). Part D provides coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. (This coverage is usually included in a Medicare Advantage plan.) Each Part D plan has different costs and has a list of covered drugs. Again, you can compare Part D plans in your area at medicare.gov. Enrollment periods and changing your mind There are very specific initial and annual enrollment periods to join, switch or drop a plan. In general, the best time to enroll in Medicare and buy Parts D or a Medigap policy is during a 7-month Initial Enrollment Period. This period automatically starts three months before you turn 65, and ends three months after the month you turn 65. During this time—and once you\\'re enrolled in Part B—you can buy any Medigap policy sold in your state, even if you have health problems. After this enrollment period, you may not be able to buy a Medigap policy and, if you are able to, it may cost more due to past or present health problems. Also be aware that in most cases, if you don\\'t enroll in Medicare when first eligible, you may have to pay a higher monthly premium due to late enrollment penalties. Fortunately, once enrolled, you have some flexibility to make changes, but special enrollment periods and rules apply. You can change your Medicare health and drug plans each year during open enrollment from October 15 to December 7, including moving between Medicare Advantage plans. Do keep in mind that if you disenroll from your Medicare Advantage Plan and switch to Original Medicare, federal law doesn’t usually give you the right to buy a Medigap plan. (The laws in your state might give you more rights.) Some thoughts on costs Like choosing any type of insurance, it’s important not to make a decision solely on price. You’ll want to compare features, benefits, premiums, out-of-pocket costs, your location, and your own health needs. A plan with a low premium may cost more in the long run, so shop around and ask questions. Most people have already paid for Part A if they or a spouse paid a certain amount of Medicare taxes when working. But you’re still responsible for a monthly premium for Part B plus Medigap, Part D, or Medicare Advantage monthly premiums. You should also be aware that if you are a high earner, your Part B and D premiums will include an additional charge (Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount or IRMAA) based on your modified adjusted gross income. And remember, healthcare costs—including Medicare, Medigap, prescription drug plans, and Medicare Advantage—change over time. So what you’re paying today can be a lot different in the future. Make sure you factor health care costs into your financial plan. I know this a lot to think about, but Medicare is an important benefit that’s worth understanding. Review the 2022 “Medicare & You” handbook for more specific details. It has information about Medicare coverage, as well as Medicare plans in your area. You can also find free help from health insurance counselors in your area by phone, through your State Health Insurance Assistance Program.

       "   'link': 'https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/5-tips-talking-to-aging-parents-about-their-finances',\n",
       "   'abstract': 'Aging parents face unique challenges. Here’s how to talk to them about their finances.',\n",
       "   'content': 'When we\\'re young, our parents try to help us manage our money effectively. But as our parents get older, the tables are likely to turn. \"Older adults face a variety of challenges: They may feel less confident making financial decisions. They may have a harder time understanding their bills and brokerage statements. And studies show they have a greater chance of being targeted by financial scams,\" says Bob Barth, a Schwab wealth strategist based in Orlando, Florida. On top of that, today\\'s retirees are living longer and therefore may need help navigating long-term care and a retirement that can stretch on for decades. \"Adult children can play an important role in helping their parents anticipate potential problems and plan for the future,\" says Nancy Murphy, a Schwab senior financial planner in Indianapolis. \"The challenge becomes figuring out how to do so in a way that feels supportive rather than condescending.\" Here are five steps for helping aging parents manage their finances. 1. Start slowly and early Parents who have accumulated significant wealth over the years may be offended by the idea that they\\'d ever need help managing their money, so don\\'t be surprised if you meet resistance. That said, the earlier you bring it up, the easier it will be to step in when they do need assistance. \"First, realize this probably isn\\'t going to be a one-and-done conversation,\" Nancy says. \"It\\'s best to start slowly by finding common ground, such as a discussion about recent market performance. That should organically lead to talks about the overall health of their investments and any concerns they might have about the longevity of their retirement savings.\" Even if your parents are amenable to help, they may find it uncomfortable to talk about money. \"The goal at this stage isn\\'t to get to the bottom of every last detail—it\\'s just to get them talking,\" Bob says. \"Once they become more comfortable discussing the broad strokes, you can move on to more delicate subjects.\" 2. Alert them to scams Next, make sure they\\'re aware of the rise in financial fraud and the growing number of scams targeting seniors. In 2020, the FBI\\'s Internet Crime Complaint Center received a total of 791,790 complaints with reported losses exceeding $4.1 billion—approximately $1 billion of which were losses to victims over the age of 60.1 \"Generally speaking, older individuals aren\\'t as savvy when it comes to modern technology, so they might not pick up on what seem to us like obvious scams,\" Nancy says. For example, if they\\'re not already familiar with today\\'s phishing tactics, explain how to spot them. Make sure they also understand they should never provide their Social Security numbers or other personal details when they receive unsolicited phone calls or emails. As an extra precaution, you might suggest a power of attorney (POA) agreement to give you or another trusted family member the authority to manage and monitor their financial accounts. With a POA, your parents retain control and ownership over their assets, but their designated agent can sign checks, withdraw funds, and handle other transactions on their behalf. If your parents are Schwab clients, they can also designate a Trusted Contact that Schwab can reach out to if it suspects fraud or diminished capacity. 3. Talk about health care With health care costs continuing to rise, a 65-year-old couple would need to save roughly $325,000 to pay for routine medical care in retirement.2 And if one or both of them develop a medical condition, that number could easily double.3 Many married couples assume that one spouse will simply take care of the other should one of them need ongoing care. That’s what Bob\\'s parents thought before both became incapacitated for different reasons. \"The idea of taking care of each other becomes less realistic the older a couple gets,\" he says. Adult children can help facilitate the discussion by doing some preliminary research into the cost of care, as well as thinking through how insurance or family members might be leveraged to help keep expenses down. \"Try to help your parents see it as a form of disaster planning,\" Bob says. \"It\\'s better to be prepared for the worst than to be blindsided by disaster, and health care is no different.\" 4. Ask about estate plans As unpleasant as it is to think about, there may come a time when your parents are no longer able to make decisions on their own. That\\'s why it\\'s so important they have financial and medical POA agreements in place, which allow you or other trusted individuals to make decisions on your parents\\' behalf. It\\'s also prudent to discuss whether they expect to pass on any assets to their heirs and to review the ramifications of certain types of inheritances, especially retirement assets. \"Some older adults are reluctant to share this information,\" Nancy says. \"But the reality is that nonspousal heirs could face real tax consequences that must be planned for.\" For example, the SECURE Act now requires most nonspouse inheritors of tax-advantaged retirement accounts to deplete them within 10 years of the decedent’s passing (or face a penalty), which will likely push the recipients into a higher tax bracket. \"But the potential consequences don\\'t end there,\" Nancy says. \"Taking withdrawals from an inherited IRA can affect an heir’s decision about when to retire—and can even increase the costs for Medicare premiums. In a worst-case scenario, it could impact a disabled heir\\'s ability to qualify for government assistance.\" She adds: \"Timing is critical to minimize tax implications.\" If you haven\\'t already done so, ask your parents to introduce you to their estate-planning attorney or financial advisor. \"He or she can help everyone concerned better understand the rules at play and all the applicable estate-planning strategies,\" Bob says. \"For example, those who plan to pass on large retirement accounts could consider a variety of different trust options to help mitigate the long-term tax consequences for heirs.\" 5. Include the family Too often, important discussions between parents and adult kids happen one-on-one rather than as a family—and that can create problems down the road. \"We see it all the time,\" Bob says. \"An absentee sibling shows up and starts second-guessing everything.\" That\\'s why he urges families to air out issues such as care and estate plans together. \"There\\'s a natural tension when it comes to questions about who\\'s going to take care of Mom and Dad,\" Nancy says. \"The best way to avoid any hard feelings is to make sure all relevant parties are included in the conversation.\" 1 \"Elder Fraud Report,\" FBI\\'s Internet Crime Complaint Center, 2020. 2 \"A Bit of Good News During the Pandemic: Savings Medicare Beneficiaries Need for Health Expenses Decrease in 2020,\" Employee Benefit Research Institute, May, 28, 2020. 3 John Bailey Jones, Mariacristina De Nardi, Eric French, Rory McGee, and Justin Kirschner, The Lifetime Medical Spending of Retirees, nber.org, 07/2018.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"The Federal Reserve has indicated it plans to start raising short-term interest rates soon. Because bond yields and bond prices generally move opposite one another, investors may assume that rate hikes lead to negative returns for municipal bonds. However, that hasn't been the case during the three most recent cycles. While each cycle is unique and this time may be different, we don’t think the prospect of Fed rate hikes is a reason to wait to invest in munis. The Fed is poised to begin raising rates again Source: Bloomberg, as of 1/26/2022. No two rate-hike periods have been identical. The table below illustrates how the economic situation varied at the start of each period. However, we can still draw some conclusions. For example, the most recent rate-rising cycle began in December 2015, a period during which the Fed raised the federal funds rate target nine times. The federal funds rate (the rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend their excess reserves to each other overnight) rose from the zero-to-0.25% range to the 2.25%-to-2.50% range over the course of three years. The Fed raised rates despite stubbornly low inflation and relatively weak economic growth in an attempt to bring the rate back to a more normal level following the 2008 credit crisis. The Fed likely will move more aggressively than in the last cycle because inflation is much higher and unemployment is lower than in 2015. In addition, we expect the Fed to start shrinking its balance sheet this year, serving as an additional form of tightening. Each rate-hike period has been unique Each rate-hike period has been unique Date of first rate hike Starting fed funds rate (%)** Number of hikes CPI (%)* Unemployment rate (%)* YOY GDP* 10-year Treasury yield Current 0.25 7.0 3.9 9.8 1.88 12/16/15 0.25 9 0.5 5.1 3.2 2.30 6/30/04 1.00 17 3.1 5.6 6.7 4.58 6/30/99 4.75 6 2.1 4.2 6.1 5.78 2/4/94 3.00 7 2.5 6.6 5.0 5.87 Disclosures *Designates this was the most recent reading prior to the first rate hike. Source: Bloomberg, as of 1/27/2022. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. Year-over-year (YOY) gross domestic product (GDP) growth measures change in the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period. Fed rate hikes haven’t been bad for muni returns in the past Basic bond math says that yields and prices move opposite one another, so many assume that when the Fed hikes rates it results in negative returns for muni bonds. However, that hasn't been the case during the three most recent cycles, which began in 1999, 2004, and 2015, respectively. In fact, total returns for municipal bonds were positive in all three periods. (We are focusing our analysis on the three most recent periods due to index limitations.) In 2004 and 2015, munis outperformed other highly rated fixed income asset classes. Total returns over rate-hike periods have been positive Source: Bloomberg Indices, as of 1/26/2022. Municipal bonds = Bloomberg US Municipal Bond Index; Bloomberg US Aggregate = Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index; US Treasuries = Bloomberg US Treasury Bond Index; Investment-grade corporates = Bloomberg US Corporate Bond Index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Part of the reason why munis have performed relatively well is likely because of the longer duration of the municipal bond index relative to the other indices, and how longer-term rates change before and after the Fed starts hiking rates. Duration measures how much a bond's price varies with changes in interest rates; the higher the duration the more price tends to change. Both short- and longer-term rates tend to rise prior to Fed rate hikes because the market moves in anticipation of higher short-term rates. In the 2004 and 2015 cycles, longer-term rates fell, which might seem counterintuitive as the Fed was raising short-term rates. Portfolios with longer durations benefited. Rates tend to rise before the Fed starts hiking rates Source Bloomberg, as of 1/26/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Digging under the muni-market hood helps illustrate why managing duration matters when the Fed is hiking rates. In the two most recent cycles where longer-term yields fell, there was a clear pattern of longer-term bonds outperforming their shorter-term counterparts. The 1999 cycle is an outlier because longer-term rates drifted higher shortly after the Fed started hiking rates. This initially resulted in negative total returns for munis. However, in time—and partially due to reinvesting—returns eventually turned positive and delivered slightly less than 0.6% over the whole period for the broad index. Total return 6 months after first rate hike Source: Components of the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index, as of 1/26/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Duration only tells part of the story The state of the economy is also a factor to consider, because the Fed usually hikes rates when the economy is strong to prevent it from overheating. Historically, lower-rated issuers have generally outperformed higher-rated issuers when the economy is strong. The opposite is also true—higher-rated issuers tend to outperform when the economy is weak. When the economy appears to be slowing, investors usually favor higher-rated issuers, which generally have more stable credit characteristics and financial flexibility. This greater financial flexibility can help an issuer better weather an economic downturn. When looking at the performance of different credit buckets, the 2004 and 2015 cycles display similar patterns (again, the 1999 cycle is somewhat of an outlier). In the 2004 and 2015 cycles, the lower-rated (A/A and Baa/BBB) portions of the muni market outperformed the higher-rated portions. Another reason lower-rated issuers outperformed in the 2004 and 2015 cycles is because their higher coupons were reinvested. Lower-rated munis have historically performed well during rate hiking cycles, with 1999 being the exception Source: Components of the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index, as of 1/26/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Summing it all up Despite each cycle being unique, munis tend to post positive returns when the Fed is hiking interest rates. We can also generalize that lower-rated and longer-term munis tend to outperform once the Fed starts hiking rates but that's really because of the change in the shape of the yield curve and the health of the economy. Based on how munis typically have performed in the past, and the current environment, we suggest targeting some lower-rated issuers and favor a benchmark or slightly shorter-than-benchmark duration. Looking at yields for AAA-rated municipal bonds relative to Treasuries, intermediate-term munis are more attractive relative to short-term munis, as illustrated in the chart below. When considering valuations today, and keeping in mind that longer-term munis generally have outperformed during Fed rate hikes, this suggests investors should add some intermediate-term munis in moderation rather than focus the core of their holdings in short-term munis. Relative yields are more attractive for intermediate munis Source: Bloomberg. Munis are represented by the Bloomberg AAA BVAL Muni Curve, as of 1/26/2022. “After-tax Treasury” assumes a 37% federal tax rate. We suggest that the bulk of a muni portfolio be in highly rated (AAA/Aaa and AA/Aa) issuers. However, given the current state of the economy, investors should consider adding some lower-rated issuers. Economic growth is expected to be strong in 2022, with a consensus economic estimate at 3.8%, albeit down from 2021. In addition, we think credit conditions for most municipal issuers are favorable. Tax revenues have soared, led by a surge in income and business taxes. Putting it into action The prospect of Fed rate hikes shouldn’t dissuade investors from taking action in the muni market. This cycle may be different from those in the past, but we still expect munis to perform relatively well despite Fed tightening.

       "   'content': \"Markets appear to be reacting to military developments in Ukraine. Russia's stock market usually trades in sync with oil prices. But recently, as oil hits new highs, Russian stocks have fallen into a bear market, likely tied to the rising risk of a Russian incursion into Ukraine. Stocks and oil prices Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 1/28/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Russia's buildup of military forces around Ukraine is larger in scope than the exercises of March 2021 and echoes the Russian invasions in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014. As in 2014, both the U.S. and NATO have communicated that they are not considering the deployment of their forces to Ukraine to repel a Russian invasion. The human costs of military action are unmeasurable. Yet, the stock market reaction to an incursion or invasion of Ukraine may echo those of the past with little measurable impact for diversified investors. Previous incidents involving Russia had little impact to the markets. Most similarly, Russia's invasion and subsequent annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 saw the S&P 500 and other developed and emerging markets around the world dip less than 2% on the day it occurred and rebound at least partially during the following five days.

Russia has very small equity exposure in the global indexes, making up only 3.2% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and just 0.4% of the global stock market measured by the MSCI AC World Index. Ukraine has no exposure in either index. Sanctions Any sustained market impact could be influenced by economic sanctions imposed on Russia. The United States has discussed with its allies measures that include cutting off Russia's largest financial institutions from global transactions to hurt Russia's businesses and imposing an embargo on American-made technology to exert pressure on Russia's military and its consumers. But there isn't unanimous support for these measures among U.S. allies. Russia is the U.S.'s 30th-largest trading partner—that is pretty far down the list. But that isn't true for Europe. Russia is Europe's fifth-largest trading partner—and accounts for 40% of the Europe's gas imports. Trade relationships Source: Charles Schwab, US Census Bureau, European Commission, Data for 2020 retrieved as of 1/28/2022. European officials worry that the proposed U.S. sanctions might prompt Russia to retaliate by cutting off natural gas and oil flows to Europe, something Russia has done previously to exert its influence. Europe is very dependent upon Russia for its energy supplies and has not been able to build up its reserves for the winter heating and energy demands. While both the U.S. and Qatar have already stepped up production to meet increasing shortages, supplies remain tight. Instead of U.S.-led sanctions, a key lever for sanctions in Europe may be Germany's willingness to halt the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline should there be an invasion of Ukraine. The Nord Stream 2 bypasses Ukraine in its delivery of natural gas from Russia to Europe, depriving the country of the approximately $2 billion in annual transit fees Russia currently pays to use the first Nord Stream pipeline. These tariffs contribute to the Russia-Ukraine hostilities. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline construction was finished in September, but German regulators have yet to issue the final legal permission Russia needs to begin operations. Germany's new Chancellor, Olaf Scholtz, has said he may not approve it if Russia invades Ukraine. Impact of sanctions Russia has taken steps in recent years, such as building up foreign currency and gold reserves (source: Central Bank of the Russian Federation) and bolstering relationships with China, to minimize the impact of financial and trade sanctions on its economy after being subjected to them for almost a decade. The 2014 sanctions imposed by the Obama administration on Russia, after its invasion of Crimea, remain in effect. Additional sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election remain in place. Further sanctions were applied by the Biden administration in 2021 after the SolarWinds cyberattack, which exposed data from both the U.S. government as well as hundreds of American companies. Any further sanctions imposed are unlikely to have meaningful economic impact on the U.S., due to limited economic exposure. There has been little impact on the U.S. economy from the sanctions listed above. U.S. exports to Russia are primarily agricultural and are unlikely to have any measurable impact on the U.S. market indexes. In Europe, the main economic impact is likely through energy prices. However, a lot of the impact to energy prices may be already priced in from politically motivated Russian supply cuts last year. Oil and gas prices have soared in Europe over the past year and are contributing to inflation and weighing on growth. To counteract this, the government in France, and others in Europe, have put freezes on consumer energy prices to try to lessen the impact. Natural gas prices in Europe Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 1/31/2022. European growth is set for a strong pace in 2022 at 3.9% according to the International Monetary Fund, despite the risks that include high energy prices. This should lend support to European stocks, especially with price-to-earnings multiple for the MSCI Europe Index which is in line with the 20-year average, in contrast to the still historically high valuations for U.S. stocks represented by the S&P 500. So far this year, European stocks have outperformed the U.S. market. A risk to continued outperformance is that the higher natural gas prices climb, the more utilities in Europe may struggle to quickly pass on those costs to consumers. China-Taiwan On the surface, there seem to be similarities between Russia invading Ukraine and China's threats to invade Taiwan. But, they are fundamentally different, and we should not assume anything about one from the other. Unlike the situation in Ukraine, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would most likely bring China's industry to a halt as semiconductor shipments flatline and might invoke a sympathetic backlash in other Chinese territories and may bring global military action from Taiwan's allies that are also dependent upon its manufacturing output. Additionally, Taiwan seems unwilling to make moves toward independence that would provoke China. A June 2021 survey conducted by Taiwan's National Chengchi University showed that only 31% support independence—not enough to empower Taiwan's leaders to break away from China, despite the impression given by the recent headlines. Most in Taiwan support the status quo, which is China's preference. Survey: Taiwan independence vs. unification Source: Election Study Center, National Chengchi University. https://esc.nccu.edu.tw/PageDoc/Detail?fid=7801&id=6963 The kinds of events that could likely push China to take military action against Taiwan include: A formal declaration of independence by Taiwan (unlikely given the limited support for independence noted above). The end of negotiations surrounding unification by all of Taiwan's main political parties (unlikely since the Chinese Nationalist Party in Taiwan has a friendly stance toward the mainland). Formal defense agreements with Taiwan signed by Western allies (possible, but the United States currently does not have such an agreement with Taiwan). The widespread acceptance of Taiwan as a country and/or equal partner in multiple international organizations, like the United Nations (50 years ago the United Nations admitted the People's Republic of China and expelled Taiwan, re-entry is not likely in the near-term). None of these appear to be on the verge of happening. Takeaway We don't believe that diversified investors need to take actions to protect portfolios from the market risks tied to potential invasion in Ukraine.

       "   'content': 'If you trade long options, you are likely familiar with one of the biggest drawbacks of this strategy, which is the impact of time decay. Once you purchase a long call or put, you can expect that your option is going to lose a little bit of value every day until expiration, all other things being equal. An estimate of how much might be lost is expressed in the \"Greek\" measure known as Theta. One way you can help offset the impact of time decay on a long option is by simultaneously selling another option against your initial position to form what is known as an options spread. There are other benefits that spreads can offer but like all options strategies there are also some trade-offs. In this article, I\\'d like to compare a long call with a vertical bull call spread in order to help illustrate some of those benefits and risks. Spread trading is considered an intermediate options strategy and requires options approval level 2 at Charles Schwab. For more information on long calls and bullish spreads, please visit Understanding Options on Schwab.com. Strategy comparison using an example I find that the best way to help establish the grounds for a meaningful comparison is through the use of an example. Let\\'s assume that there are two traders who are equally bullish on XYZ in the near-term and intend to use options to potentially capitalize on that bullish forecast. Trader #1 decides to purchase a long call while Trader #2 decides to establish a bull call spread. Let\\'s start by evaluating Trader #1\\'s long call strategy using some common strategy attributes and options Greeks, such as Delta, Theta and Vega. Then we will perform the same assessment on Trader #2\\'s bull call spread. Finally, we will put these two strategies side by side and review their respective benefits and trade-offs. Long call example To start, let\\'s assume that XYZ is trading for $173.92 and trader #1 decides to purchase the 165.00 call that expires in 45 days. With the help of some Greeks from the option chain below, let\\'s assess what this implies about this particular contract. Source: StreetSmart Edge® XYZ 1/21/2022 165.00 C Summary XYZ 1/21/2022 165.00 C Summary Cost Break-Even Price Delta Theta Vega Maximum Gain 165.00 Call $1270.00 $177.70 0.7012 -0.0721 0.2117 Unlimited Cost: As you can see from the image above the 165.00 call has an ask price of $12.70 so the total cost, taking the 100 multiplier into account, is $1,270.00, excluding commissions. The cost (as with any long options strategy) is also the maximum potential loss. Break-even price: The break-even price is calculated by adding the cost of the 165.00 call to the strike price, so 165.00 + $12.70 yields a break-even price of $177.70. By purchasing this call trader #1 is essentially indicating that he or she believes that XYZ will close above the break-even price of $177.70 at expiration (let’s assume this trader does not intend to close out the position prior to expiration). Delta: The 0.7012 Delta has two implications – this particular call has an approximate 70% chance of closing in the money at expiration, and initially you can expect the value of this contract to increase/decrease by about $0.7012 for a corresponding $1.00 move higher/lower (respectively) in the price of XYZ. Delta is a dynamic number which changes when any of the other option pricing variables change. Theta: A Theta of -0.0721 suggests that, initially, the value of this contract is expected to lose roughly $0.07 per day until expiration, all other variables held constant. Like Delta, and all of the Greeks for that matter, Theta is also a dynamic number which changes when any of the option pricing variables change. Vega: A Vega of 0.2117 tells you how much you can initially expect the value of the contract to change in reaction to a 1% change in the implied volatility of XYZ. For example, if the implied volatility on XYZ decreases 1% you can expect the value of this contract to initially lose $0.2117. Maximum gain: Similar to a long stock position the price of XYZ really doesn’t have a theoretical limit to how high it can rise and therefore neither does the long call (at least up until expiration). Bull call spread example Now let\\'s turn to trader #2 who also decides to buy the 165.00 call which expires in 45 days but also decides to simultaneously sell the 175.00 call which expires at the same time, thereby establishing a 165.00/175.00 vertical bull call spread. Source: StreetSmart Edge® XYZ 1/21/2022 165.00 C/175.00 C Summary XYZ 1/21/2022 165.00 C/175.00 C Summary Cost Break-Even Price Delta Theta Vega Maximum Gain 165.00 Call $1,270.00 $177.70 0.7012 -0.0721 0.2117 175.00 Call -$655.00 -0.4946 +0.0780 -0.2435 Combined Spread $615.00 $171.15 0.2066 +0.0059 -0.0318 $385.00 Cost: As we previously established, the cost of the 165.00 call is $12.70 so when taking into account the $6.55 received from selling the 175.00 call, the total cost of the spread is $6.15, or $615.00, when taking the 100 multiplier into account (excluding commissions). The $615.00 cost of this spread represents the maximum potential loss and occurs if XYZ closes at or below $165.00 at expiration. Break-even price: The break-even price for this spread is calculated by adding the $6.15 combined cost of the spread to the lower strike price of 165.00 which gives us a price of $171.15 at expiration. Delta: The combined Delta for this bull call spread is calculated by subtracting the 0.4946 Delta of the 175.00 call from the 0.7012 Delta of the 165.00 call. The Delta of the 175.00 call is subtracted from the 165.00 call since the contract is being sold and the combined spread Delta of 0.2066 indicates that the value of the overall spread will initially increase or decrease by about $0.2066 with a corresponding $1.00 move (higher or lower) in the price of XYZ. Theta: Since the 175.00 call is being sold, the Theta is positive since a short call gains value with the passage of time (all else held constant). Similar to Delta, this +0.0780 Theta is then combined with the -0.0721 Theta of the 165.00 call, which gives us a positive 0.0059 Theta for the overall spread. While this suggests that the value of the spread will initially gain a little bit of value with the passage of time, keep in mind the Theta of each contract is subject to change with the passage of time, or when any of the option pricing variables are altered. Vega: Similar to Delta and Theta, the Vega of 0.2117 on the 165.00 call is combined with the negative Vega of the short 175.00 call which gives us a Vega of -0.0318 for the combined spread. This low Vega suggests that volatility risk has essentially been taken out of the equation. If implied volatility rises or falls significantly, the gain or loss from the long contract (i.e., the 165.00 call) is nearly completely offset by the corresponding gain or loss from the short contract (i.e., the 175.00 call). Maximum gain: The maximum gain of this bull call spread equals the distance between the two strikes, or $10.00, minus the cost of the combined spread ($6.15). Therefore, the maximum gain is $10.00-$6.15 =$3.85 or $385.00, when taking the 100 multiplier into consideration (excluding commissions). The maximum gain is achieved if XYZ closes at or above $175.00 at expiration. Now let\\'s compare these two strategies to get a better sense of their respective benefits and drawbacks. Long call vs. bull call spread Long call vs. bull call spread Cost Break-Even Price Delta Theta Vega Maximum Gain 165.00 Call $1,270 $177.70 0.7012 -0.0721 0.2117 Unlimited 165.00/175.00 Call Spread $615 $171.15 0.2066 +0.0059 -0.0318 $385.00 Cost: Lower overall cost is a primary driver of establishing a debit spread and the bull call spread in this example costs about 52% less than the long call. Advantage: bull call spread. Break-even price: In order for the long call to break-even the price of the underlying needs to increase by $3.78 ($177.70 - $173.92) in 45 days. Conversely, at a current price of $173.92, XYZ can go mainly sideways for the next 45 days and the bull call spread will still manage a small gain since the break-even price is $171.15. Additionally, if you think of a trade strictly in terms of the \"probability of making a profit,\" and consider all of the possible XYZ closing prices at expiration, then the nod goes to the 165.00/175.00 bull call spread in this category. Advantage: bull call spread. Delta: The disparity between the Delta\\'s of these two strategies highlights one of the biggest drawbacks of a spread trade: lower relative gain with a beneficial move in the price of the underlying. Both traders are bullish on XYZ but trader #1 will see the value of his long call increase by about $0.70 with a $1.00 increase in XYZ while trader #2 will only see an increase of about $0.20. As expiration approaches, the combined Delta on the spread is likely to move closer to parity with the 165.00 call, but bull call spread traders need to be aware of this trade-off: the increase in value from the long option is going to be partially offset by the increase in value from the short option when you get a beneficial move in the price of the underlying. Advantage: long call. Theta: Time decay can be one of the biggest profit eliminators for long option traders and as you can see in the table above the 165.00 long call is initially set to lose approximately $0.07, or about 0.5%, per day due to time decay. Conversely, you can see that not only has time decay been eliminated on the 165.00/175.00 bull call spread but there would actually be an initial (albeit small) gain after one day elapses (all other variables held constant). Advantage: bull call spread. Vega: The value of the 165.00 long call stands to gain $0.2117 with a 1% increase in implied volatility but lose $0.2117 with a 1% drop in implied volatility. Therefore, you can see that there is \"volatility risk\" to the long call strategy. However, with a Vega of -0.0318 you can see that the 165.00/175.00 bull call spread has essentially eliminated volatility risk. Some might consider taking the volatility risk out of the equation a benefit of spread trading but since the benefit is not necessarily clear-cut we will mark this category as neutral. No advantage to either long call or bull call spread. Maximum gain: The potential for significant profits is probably one of the most alluring factors for long option traders. As you can see from above, the 165.00 long call offers (theoretical) unlimited upside while the 165.00/175.00 bull call spread can only achieve a $385.00 profit at best. The maximum gain of $385.00 profit on the bull call spread represents a 62% profit when compared to the $615 cost (excluding commissions). Advantage: long call. Bottom line The intent of this article is not to necessarily persuade you to select one strategy over another, it is meant to help shed light on the benefits and trade-offs to assist you when deciding which strategy to initiate. If you are comfortable with the risk and you are exceptionally bullish on a stock, then you might prefer a long call strategy over a bull call spread since it offers more profit potential. Having said that, even if you are bullish on a stock, it may not make the desired move within the needed timeframe in order to achieve a profit, so you might consider a bull call spread since it substantially reduces the time decay component. Regardless of how you proceed, I hope this article has helped provide some insight into how these two strategies match up.'}],\n",

       "   'abstract': 'If the Federal Reserve hikes rates, investment-grade floating-rate note yields may rise—but there are pros and cons to investing in them.',\n",
       "   'content': 'With the Federal Reserve likely to begin raising its target short-term interest rate as soon as its March meeting, we believe investment-grade floating-rate notes are worth consideration today. As the federal funds rate rises or falls, floater coupon rates tend to follow, and their prices aren\\'t overly sensitive to fluctuating interest rates. There are pros and cons to investing in floaters, however, and performance relative to fixed-rate corporate bonds can vary. While they are certainly worth consideration today, it\\'s important to understand their various nuances, and to pay attention to the outlook for Federal Reserve policy, as the pace and magnitude of rate hikes can play an important role in floating-rate note performance. The basics of floaters Investment-grade floating-rate notes, commonly referred to as \"floaters,\" are a type of corporate bond investment whose coupon rates are tied to a short-term benchmark rate. A measure of additional yield is usually added to the reference rate to compensate investors for the risks of lending to a corporation, such as the potential that it will default and fail to make timely payments on its debt. Because these are issued by investment-grade-rated corporations, the \"spread\" between the reference rate and the floating-rate note yield tends to be relatively low, usually in the 25- to 100-basis-point range.1 The underlying reference rates for floaters can vary these days. Historically, floaters were referenced to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) but that rate is in the process of being retired. Many recent floater issues use the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the reference rate. Any way you slice it, the underlying reference rates are short-term rates and tend to have a strong relationship with the federal funds rate. Floater coupon rates tend to follow the lead of the federal funds rate Source: Bloomberg, using weekly data as of 1/21/2022. Bloomberg U.S. Floating Rate Note Index (BFRNTRUU Index) and U.S. Federal Funds Target Rate Mid Point of Range (FDTRMID). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Floaters are attractive in a rising-interest-rate environment because their prices are not very sensitive to changing interest rates. Their coupon rate adjusts to shifts in short-term interest rates, so their prices don\\'t need to. That results in more stable prices regardless of what Treasury yields are doing. However, floater prices can fluctuate due to credit concerns. If the economic outlook deteriorates, floater prices can fall if corporations\\' ability to service their debts declines. Three things to consider with floaters The prospect of rising short-term interest rates doesn\\'t necessarily mean that floaters are the right investment for all investors. There are pros and cons to investing in floaters, and their performance compared to fixed-rated corporate bonds has been mixed during previous Fed rate-hike cycles. Here are three things to consider before adding investment-grade floaters to your portfolio: 1. Floater yields are lower than fixed-rate corporate bond yields The bond market tends to be forward-looking. When market participants expect the Fed to start hiking rates, many bond yields will rise in anticipation. For example, the 2-year Treasury yield rose above 1% in mid-January for the first time since before the pandemic began. Meanwhile, the 3-month Treasury bill yield was anchored at roughly 0.15%. One- to five-year fixed-rate corporate bond yields have risen due to this dynamic with Treasury yields, while floater yields remain stubbornly low. Keep in mind that floater coupon yields should rise once the Fed begins to hike rates, but it will take a number of hikes before the average yield catches up to the yield-to-worst2 of the fixed-rate index. If you\\'re looking for higher income payments today—rather than waiting for the Fed to hike rates—short-term corporate bonds might make more sense. As the chart below illustrates, it would take roughly five Fed rate hikes for the yield of the floater index to catch the yield of the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate 1-5 Year Bond Index. Floater yields are well below short-term, fixed-rate corporate bond yields today Source: Bloomberg, using weekly data as of 1/21/2022. Bloomberg U.S. Floating Rate Note Index (BFRNTRUU Index) and Bloomberg U.S. Corporate 1-5 Year Bond Index (LDC5TRUU Index). Yield-to-worst is the lower of the yield-to-call or yield-to-maturity. It\\'s the lowest potential rate of return for a bond, absent a default. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 2. Floater prices tend to be very stable This is a key benefit for investors, especially for those who are worried about the effect of rising interest rates on their bond holdings. The prices and yields of fixed-rate bonds have an inverse relationship. If a fixed-rate bond\\'s yield rises, its price falls (and vice versa). If market interest rates rise, a low fixed coupon rate may no longer be attractive—the price will generally fall to make its yield more in line with market interest rates. That\\'s not the case with floaters. Because their coupons adjust with market interest rates, their prices don\\'t need to. Over time, floater prices tend to be very stable, whether the Fed is raising or lowering interest rates. Keep in mind that floaters can help mitigate interest rate risk, but they still have credit risk, like the risk of default. If credit conditions deteriorate and the creditworthiness of corporate bond issuers declines, floater prices can fall just like the prices of fixed-rate bonds. Sector concentration is another risk. Bonds from the financial institutions sector make up 58% of the Bloomberg U.S. Floating-Rate Notes Index, meaning it\\'s difficult to get much sector diversification and the market could be sensitive to periods of financial stress. The chart below illustrates these risks, as floater prices fell during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the 2011 European debt crisis, and in the early days of the 2020 pandemic. Floater prices tend to be much more stable than fixed-rate bond prices Source: Bloomberg, using weekly data as of 1/21/2022. Bloomberg U.S. Floating Rate Note Index (BFRNTRUU Index) and Bloomberg U.S. Corporate 1-5 Year Bond Index (LDC5TRUU Index). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 3. Performance varies The pace and number of rate hikes tend to influence how floaters perform relative to short-term, fixed-rate corporate bonds. During the 2004-2006 rate-hike cycle, floaters significantly outperformed as the Fed hiked rates a total of 17 times, raising its target rate from 1% in June 2004 all the way to 5.25% by June 2006. Not only did floaters outperform their fixed-rate counterparts, but they also experienced a lot less volatility. Floaters outperformed during the 2004-2006 rate hike cycle, with little volatility Source: Bloomberg. Total returns from 6/25/2004 through 6/30/2006. Bloomberg U.S. Corporate 1-5 Year Bond Index (LDC5TRUU Index) and Bloomberg U.S. Floating Rate Notes Index (BFRNTRUU Index). Total returns assume reinvestment of interest and capital gains. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Fast-forward to 2015, and the performance numbers are not as impressive. Over the three-year rate-hike cycle, floaters only modestly outperformed short-term, fixed-rate corporate bonds, but much of that outperformance came at the end of the rate-hike cycle. For the first two years of the rate-hike cycle, floater performance lagged as the Fed took a very patient approach to rate hikes. The Fed raised its target rate by 25 basis points in December 2015, and then waited a full year to hike rates again. When all was said and done, the Fed hiked rates a total of nine times over three full years, compared to 17 times over just two years in the previous cycle. Floaters eventually outperformed fixed-rated corporates during the last cycle, also will little volatility Source: Bloomberg. Total returns from 12/11/2015 through 12/21/2018. Bloomberg U.S. Corporate 1-5 Year Bond Index (LDC5TRUU Index) and Bloomberg U.S. Floating Rate Notes Index (BFRNTRUU Index). Total returns assume reinvestment of interest and capital gains. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. As we approach the beginning of the next Fed rate hike cycle, the pace and number of rate hikes will play a large role in the performance of floaters. If the Fed hikes too quickly and the economic outlook deteriorates as a result, it might not be able to even get to a 2% federal funds rate. In that scenario, floaters could underperform, as their income payments might not rise enough to make up the difference that fixed-rate corporate bonds provide today. However, if the Fed takes a more patient approach to rate hikes—enough to slow inflation but not enough to derail the strong economic momentum—then it may be able to successfully increase the federal funds rate above the 2% level (or potentially even higher), in which case floaters may outperform as their coupon payments continue to grow. What to consider now Investment-grade floaters can make sense as the Fed begins to hike rates. While performance has been mixed compared to fixed-rate corporate bonds during previous rate hike cycles, their low interest rate sensitivity may make them more attractive for investors worried about the risk of rising rates on their bond holdings. Floaters can allow you to stay invested in the bond market, rewarding investors with higher income payments as the Fed hikes rates, rather than trying to time the market and waiting for the \"right\" time to invest in bonds. One way to get direct exposure is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks a floater index. Unfortunately there isn\\'t a specific Morningstar category for investment-grade floating rate notes, but there is a way to screen for funds using the ETF screener. First start with \"Taxable Bond\" as the Fund Category, and then under Morningstar Category, select \"Ultrashort bond.\" Finally, on the left side of the screen, select \"Fund Name\" and include \"float\" as a descriptor. Using those criteria should provide some ETFs that focus on investment-grade floaters, but keep in mind that might not be the comprehensive list. 1 One basis point is equal to 1/100th of one percent, or 0.01%, or 0.0001. Thus 50 basis points is equal to 0.5% and 100 basis points is equal to 1%. 2 Yield-to-worst is the lower of the yield-to-call or yield-to-maturity. It\\'s the lowest potential rate of return for a bond, absent a default.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'You’ve got the basic concepts and tools, so are you ready to invest? Not quite. Read part 3 before you buy.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, In the past two columns I\\'ve introduced different types of investments and the concepts you need to understand to put them to work. First, you need to know why asset allocation (how you divide your money between stocks, bonds and cash) and diversification (having a broad mix of each of these types of investments) are crucial to your long-term success. Then you need to understand the differences between core investments and how they work together. So let\\'s say you know you’re looking for long-term growth, and you\\'ve researched and chosen a couple of mutual funds. Are you ready to buy? Not quite. There are a few more things to consider: what type of account to open, the impact of taxes, and how to keep your portfolio healthy—and, hopefully, growing. Why the type of account is important When you\\'re simply putting money aside, whether for a rainy day or for something special in the next couple of years, a bank savings account can work just fine. You\\'ll only make a small amount of interest but you will have easy access to your money. An investment account is very different. It\\'s offered through a brokerage firm and allows you to buy and sell investments like stocks and bonds. There may be an initial minimum deposit and account fees, depending on where you open your account. And some firms also charge a commission to buy and sell certain investments, so you\\'ll want to do some comparison-shopping to be sure you get the best value for your needs. The financial institution is one decision, but you also have to decide what type of investment account best suits your goals: a taxable brokerage account, a tax-advantaged account—or both. The type of account will determine how much you can invest and when, and how your earnings will be taxed. Taxes are important because after all, it\\'s not just what you gain, but what you keep, that matters. Let\\'s break all of that down according to some common goals. Get more from Ask Carrie. Go to Ask Carrie hub Taxable accounts for \"anytime\" investing A brokerage account is the most flexible. (Although remember, investing is for goals that are at least five years in the future. This allows you to weather the volatility of the stock market but benefit from the growth stocks provide.) There are no limits on how much you can invest, and no timing considerations other than your own. You can invest as much as you want at any time and make unlimited withdrawals. That\\'s pretty straightforward. The tax rules, however, are a little more complex. In a savings account you pay income taxes on interest income whether or not you withdraw the funds. In a taxable brokerage account, taxes are a bit more complicated. You\\'ll pay income taxes on interest income, but you\\'ll pay either short- or long-term capital gains tax on any money you make when you sell an investment that\\'s gone up in value. In addition, you\\'ll pay long-term capital gains tax on qualified dividends. Short-term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate and apply to investments you\\'ve held for a year or less; long-term rates are generally lower than ordinary income rates—currently 0, 15 or 20 percent depending on your income. They apply to investments you\\'ve held for more than a year. Tax-advantaged accounts for retirement and more Tax-advantaged accounts are tailored to a specific goal like retirement or college savings. Earnings grow tax deferred to help you grow your money but penalties apply to early or non-qualified withdrawals. There\\'s more to take into consideration, including contribution limits, tax benefits and withdrawal rules depending on the account. Here\\'s an overview of the most common tax-advantaged accounts. Employer-sponsored retirement account—With a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored account that allows voluntary contributions, those contributions can be made automatically from your paycheck and you may get an upfront tax deduction. Annual contribution limits are sizeable—$20,500 for tax-year 2022, plus a $6,500 catch-up for those age 50 or older for some plans. Note: Some employers will contribute or match a certain percentage of your 401(k) contributions; you should always take advantage of this extra money. Individual retirement account (IRA)—As an individual with earned income, you have a choice of a traditional or Roth IRA (although a Roth IRA has income limits). Each has the same general annual contribution limit—currently $6,000 with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older. (Special contribution rules apply to Roths). With a traditional IRA, you generally get an upfront tax deduction on contributions and withdrawals are typically taxed as ordinary income. With a Roth IRA, there\\'s no upfront deduction, but both earnings and withdrawals are tax-free as long as you\\'re at least 59½ and have held the Roth for five years. So if you think you’re going to be in a higher tax bracket when making withdrawals, the Roth is likely the better bet. Health Savings Account (HSA)—If your health plan has a high annual deductible ($1,400 for individuals, $2,800 for families in 2022), you may qualify for an HSA. HSAs let you make annual deductible contributions (currently $3,650 for an individual; $7,300 for a family) and earnings grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals for qualified healthcare expenses are tax-free. 529 College Savings Account—This is a state-sponsored program that allows parents, family members—anyone—to invest in education. There is no federal up-front tax deduction, but earnings grow tax-deferred and withdrawals are tax-free for qualified education expenses. How to stay on top of your investments Once your investments are up and running, take a long-term view. That doesn\\'t mean you can ignore them, however. The closer you are to using the funds, the more you want to monitor your investments. You\\'ll want to re-examine your asset allocation and possibly rebalance. Basically, rebalancing means looking at the percentage of stocks, bonds, cash and other investments in your portfolio to make sure it aligns with your risk preferences and time to invest, and making changes if necessary. For instance, if stocks have done well, it might be time to sell some and use the proceeds to buy bonds. If bonds have had an exceptional year, it might be time to sell a few in favor of stocks. This is the strategy the largest institutional investors, such as university pensions, use and will help you keep your overall plan on track. When to get help Even when you understand investing, it pays to get help once in a while. A periodic consultation with a financial professional can help you deepen your knowledge and refine your decisions. But whether you work with a financial advisor or go it alone, the main point of these last three columns is this: Don\\'t be afraid to ask questions.

       "   'abstract': 'What does a “correction” mean, what’s likely to happen next and what can investors do now?',\n",
       "   'content': 'When a stock index falls more than 10% from a recent high, it is often said to have entered \"correction\" territory. That\\'s a fairly neutral term for what can be an unpleasant experience to many investors. What does a correction mean? What could happen afterward, and what can you do to help your portfolio weather the downturn? Here are answers to some commonly asked questions: What is a correction? There\\'s no universally accepted definition of a correction, but most people consider a correction to have occurred when a major stock index, such as the S&P 500® index or Dow Jones Industrial Average, declines by more than 10% (but less than 20%) from its most recent peak. It\\'s called a correction because historically the drop often \"corrects\" and returns prices to their longer-term trend. Do corrections mark the start of a bear market? Nobody can predict with any degree of certainty whether a correction will reverse or turn into a bear market (that is, periods when the market is down by 20% or more). However, historically most corrections haven\\'t become bear markets. There have been 24 market corrections since November 1974, and only five of them became bear markets (which began in 1980, 1987, 2000, 2007, and 2020). Since 1974, only five market corrections have become bear markets Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Morningstar, Inc. Each period listed represents the beginning month/year of either a market correction or a bear market. The general definition of a market correction is a market decline that is more than 10%, but less than 20%. A bear market is usually defined as a decline of 20% or greater. The market is represented by the S&P 500 index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. But what if it really is the start of a bear market? No bull market runs forever. While they can be scary, bear markets can be expected to occur periodically throughout every investor\\'s lifetime. It\\'s also helpful to keep them in perspective. Since 1966, the average bear market has lasted roughly 15 months, far shorter than the average bull market. And they often end as abruptly as they began, with a quick rebound that is very difficult to predict—a case in point is the S&P 500\\'s pandemic-fueled bear market in early 2020, which lasted a mere 33 days from the previous high on February 19 to the trough on March 23. That\\'s why long-term investors are usually better off staying the course and not pulling money out of the market. Past bear markets have tended to be shorter than bull markets Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Bloomberg as of 12/31/2021. The market is represented by daily price returns of the S&P 500 index. Bear markets are defined as periods with cumulative declines of at least 20% from the previous peak close. Its duration is measured as the number of days from the previous peak close to the lowest close reached after it has fallen at least 20%, and includes weekends and holidays. Periods between bear markets are designated as bull markets. Indices are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. What should I do now? Worrying excessively about a bear market can be counterproductive but being prepared for one is always a good idea. Consider investing strategies that potentially could help your portfolio—and your emotional wellbeing—in case of a significant downturn. Here are some additional steps all investors should consider: If you don\\'t have a financial plan, consider making one. A written financial plan can help you craft an appropriately balanced portfolio. It can also calm your nerves and make it easier to stay the course when markets get bumpy. Review your risk tolerance. It\\'s relatively easy to take risks when the market is rising, but market downturns sometimes can be a wake-up call to consider adjusting your target asset allocation. Consider how much loss you have the emotional and financial capacity to handle. Schwab\\'s investor profile questionnaire can help you determine your investor profile and match it to an appropriate allocation. Rebalance regularly. Market changes can skew your allocation from its original target. Over time, assets that have gained in value will account for more of your portfolio, while those that have declined will account for less. Rebalancing means selling positions that have become overweight in relation to the rest of your portfolio, and moving the proceeds to positions that have become underweight. It\\'s a good idea to rebalance at regular intervals. Take your life stage into consideration. If you\\'re a younger investor saving for a goal that is 15 or more years away, you have time to potentially recover from a market drop. However, the picture may change for investors nearing or in retirement. Regular rebalancing and appropriate diversification are important for you at this stage, and your risk profile typically will become more conservative as retirement approaches. If you\\'ve recently retired and begun to withdraw from your portfolio, you also should be aware that poor returns in the early years of retirement can have a very negative effect on a portfolio; consider taking steps to avoid selling assets in a down market, such as reducing your planned withdrawals or postponing large expenses.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'When it comes to options trading, education and awareness are important for establishing a strong foundation. Consider these common mistakes that traders often encounter.',\n",
       "   'content': 'If you are reading this article there\\'s a good chance that you have never traded options or are just getting started. Regardless of whether you fall into one of those categories or not, this article is meant to highlight some common hazards that may be encountered by options traders to potentially help you avoid them. If you are considering options trading but you don\\'t have a lot of experience trading stocks, I\\'d suggest gaining more experience with trading stocks before venturing into the world of derivatives. Options fall into the category of derivatives because their value is \"derived\" from a different (underlying) asset, such as a stock, index or ETF. However, options are sophisticated instruments and have different risks that you won\\'t find in stocks. Therefore, education and understanding are crucial before placing your first trade or determining whether options are appropriate for you. I\\'m not trying to deter you from options, because they aren\\'t necessarily riskier than stocks, it\\'s just that you should have an understanding of how they work before engaging any options strategy. The intent of this article is to provide a better understanding of those nuances and potentially help you avoid some of the mistakes highlighted below. Pitfall #1: Over-Leveraging Options are leveraged products, meaning that each standard call or put is generally equal to 100 shares of the underlying stock or ETF and cost significantly less to initiate versus an equivalent stock/ETF position. When you first begin trading options, you may realize that you have additional capital to put to work that may have been tied up with equivalent stock/ETF positions in the past. Therefore, there may be a tendency to use that capital to purchase additional contracts on the same position or extend yourself into other positions that you might otherwise not have acquired due to capital constraints. Regardless of the strategy or the number of shares you own on a given stock, you may want to consider starting with small contract positions in the beginning until you gain more experience with options. For example, if you own 500 shares of XYZ and are interested in generating some income on this position, you might consider selling only 1 or 2 covered calls against the position in the beginning and then after expiration you can determine how you want to proceed (sell the same number of contracts or more, or select another position to sell calls against, etc.). Pitfall #2: Using Long Near-Term Calls or Puts for Speculation When buying long options, it\\'s not uncommon for new option traders to gravitate toward near-term call or put options because of the lower relative prices and the potential to achieve higher percentage returns. It\\'s not that you can\\'t trade long call and put options successfully, it\\'s just that most new option traders don\\'t fully understand the impact of time decay, especially for near-dated option contracts. Looking at the time decay curve below, you can see that the rate of decay generally accelerates as the option approaches its expiration date, especially for at-the-money options: Yes, you can potentially achieve big percentage returns by buying short-dated options, but that also tends to be where the highest degree of risk occurs. If you decide to buy calls or puts in order to speculate on near-term stock movement, understand that time is working against you, so you\\'ll typically need the stock to make a sizeable move in a relatively short period of time in order to make a profit. Therefore, if you decide to buy them you may want to consider a shorter-term mindset and be willing to take a quicker profit or loss than you might otherwise take with other options strategies. The above chart helps illustrate why many option traders prefer to sell near-dated options and take advantage of that accelerated time decay. Pitfall #3: Altering Your Trading Strategy on a Losing Trade This pitfall could essentially apply to any trading strategy with any financial product but it\\'s important to highlight since options are a leveraged instrument. As you are probably aware, when it comes to trading it\\'s important to have a willingness to admit you are wrong when a trade turns against you and exit the position to avoid additional losses. However, since there is a financial as well as an emotional investment (i.e., pride) in every trade that you place, there can be a tendency to justify an adjustment to your original trading strategy in an effort to potentially avert a loss. This potential problem could arise in a number of forms, so keep an eye out for the following behaviors: Refraining from exiting the losing trade to avoid the potential regret if the stock reverses course after you close out the position. Doubling the contract quantity of your option position (i.e., \"doubling down\") in an effort to improve your break-even/profit Taking on more risk (increasing your normal contract quantity) on your next trade following a losing trade to offset the negative emotion associated with the previous loss. Going back to a stock that you lost money on in an effort to \"get it back.\" The bottom line is that all traders encounter losing trades, but those who learn how to cut losses and move on tend to have more success in the long-run. Pitfall #4: Not Being Aware of the Strategy Trade-Off Every option strategy provides a benefit and has a corresponding trade-off in exchange for that benefit. If you are a Schwab client and brand new to options trading, when you apply for options your account will likely be approved for options level 0, which essentially includes the income generating and/or protective options strategies: covered calls, protective puts (for stocks), cash-secured equity puts (CSEPs), and collars. Often the first trade that a new options trader places is a covered call trade, which involves selling a call against an existing stock position to generate a small amount of income on that position. This is often the most appropriate options strategy for beginners since it can help you monitor and understand how option prices fluctuate over time. However, it\\'s important to understand that, while the benefit of this strategy is potential income generation, the trade-off is that you sacrifice the potential upside gain on the stock beyond the strike price of the call. For example, if you sell a $65.00 strike call against your XYZ stock position for $1.00 and XYZ gaps up to $75.00 on positive news afterwards, you are obligated to sell your position at $65.00 at any time until expiration (assuming it is still trading above $65.00), and you will not profit on any of the stock price movement from $65.00 to $75.00. Pitfall #5: Believing that the More Complex the Strategy Is, the More Profitable It Will Be Like other investment products that are publicly traded, options are priced very efficiently. Options are listed on exchanges and allow you to take either side of the market meaning, if you believe a quoted price on a given call or put is too low or too high, you can decide to take the other side of the market and buy or sell that option, respectively. In other words, option prices are efficiently priced and reflect the known information about the underlying security. There may be a tendency for new options traders to believe that the more sophisticated the option strategy, or the more legs the strategy has, the more likely it will be to make money, but this simply isn\\'t the case because of that price efficiency. While each options strategy offers its own unique risk/reward characteristics, and some may be more appropriate than others based on your objective in a given circumstance, don\\'t assume that you will have a higher probability of success if you trade the more complex strategies. Many options traders use covered calls and cash-secured equity puts and are generally satisfied sticking with those strategies. The important thing is that you find a strategy that you are familiar with (from an education standpoint), comfortable with (from an experience standpoint), and successful with most of the time (from a P/L standpoint). Final Tips Whatever option strategy you start with, I suggest paper trading the intended strategy and tracking the results before putting real money to work. Always use limit orders when you place an order, which may allow you to get some price improvement from the quoted bid or ask price. However, keep in mind that limit orders could also cause you to miss the trade altogether if the price moves away from you. You don\\'t have to hold any options position, long or short, until expiration. If your reason for entering the trade changes (i.e., you bought a protective put but now you no longer feel concerned about the potential downside) then consider exiting the trade to preserve capital and/or time value. I hope that the above information helps you avoid unnecessary mistakes and perhaps trade with a little more confidence.

       "   'abstract': 'Puzzled by how to choose investments? Here’s part-2 in a 3-part series to help you decide what’s right for you.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, Last week, I wrote about the investing concepts people need to understand but often hesitate to ask about—things like asset allocation, diversification and risk. But if you're unclear on a concept, I say ask. And ask again if you have more questions. The same goes for types of investments. Stocks and bonds might seem pretty basic but there's a lot to understand about the different types and why one might be a better choice than another. So this week, I want to discuss what to look for when choosing investments. Starting with stocks A share of stock is a portion of ownership in a company, allowing you to participate in a company's growth. While owning stocks carries the risk of loss as well as the potential for gain, historically it has been one of the best ways to build wealth over time. When you choose a specific stock, however, you have to look closely. Here are some things to consider: Market capitalization—Companies vary by size, or market capitalization, which is the total value of outstanding shares of a company's stock. Apple currently has the largest market capitalization in the world and is a great example of a large-cap stock. But there are also small-cap and mid-cap stocks. Style—Getting more detailed, there are two basic styles of stock: growth and value. A growth stock is considered poised for a rapid rise (think high tech); a value stock is considered underpriced for its earnings and long-term prospects. Sector and industry—Stocks are also generally divided into 11 sectors (such as information technology, utilities, and health care) and 69 industries within those sectors (such as retailing, banks, and building products). International/Domestic—You can invest in companies based in the U.S. or abroad. International markets can be further divided into developed markets (such as Japan or the U.K.) and emerging markets (such as China or India). The ideal is to invest in a globally diversified mix of stocks of all of the above. This helps control risk, although it certainly doesn’t ensure a profit or eliminate risk. Sounds challenging, but don't get discouraged. Here's where mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) come in, which I'll get into in just a bit. Moving into bonds Bonds operate much like an IOU; you lend money to a company, government or government agency and, in return, you receive a promise of repayment, plus interest, at specific dates. Bonds complement stocks and are particularly useful for retirees as they can provide a predictable income stream. They're generally less volatile than stocks but not without risk. There are many types of bonds (for example, corporate, government, and municipal), each of which carries varying degrees of different types of risk, including: Default risk—if the issuer defaults on its promises of repayment or goes bankrupt and you won’t get your money back, Interest rate risk—if interest rates rise and the value of your bond goes down, Purchasing power risk—if the price and/or interest you receive loses value relative to inflation. In general, bonds that have the highest risk have the highest yield and the longest maturity. For example, a long-term bond from a start-up company would be high risk, and even higher if it had an unclear future or was already heavily indebted. U.S. Government bonds, which include Treasury bonds, notes and bills, are considered the safest. Shorter-term bonds are less volatile than longer-term bonds but generally have a lower yield. To help clarify the risks, credit rating agencies issue a grade, or credit rating, to virtually every corporate or government bond. Keep in mind that these ratings can change after you buy. Get more from Ask Carrie. Go to Ask Carrie hub Giving a nod to cash and its equivalents Cash isn't only the balance in your savings account; it can also be a type of investment. Cash investments, also called cash equivalents, are low risk but have minimal potential for return. Think CDs, Treasury bills and money market funds. Thinking about the plusses and minuses, cash is great for stability and liquidity, but it’s not the best choice for building long-term wealth. In fact, returns may well be lower than the inflation rate. Therefore, if you have too much of your money in cash, it could be harder to meet your long-term goals. Making the most of mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) If you're thinking it's time-consuming and complicated to evaluate all the choices—you're right. Luckily, mutual funds and ETFs can help simplify the process because they do much of the choosing and monitoring of individual securities for you. Mutual funds—A mutual fund pools money from many investors and invests in a broad range of securities. That way, you can achieve a certain level of diversification without having to choose each individual security. Be careful, though, because the amount of diversification you achieve depends on the mutual fund(s) you choose (there are stock funds, bond funds, money market funds, and funds that invest in all of these). Mutual funds are professionally managed, so you don’t have to follow the day-to-day market. But there are two fundamentally different approaches to consider: passive and active. Passively managed funds, known as index funds, are designed to track—rather than beat—a specific index such as the S&P 500®. (The S&P 500 index tracks the performance of 500 large companies representing nearly 80% of the total U.S. market.) Actively managed funds, on the other hand, strive to beat the market. While active management may result in better performance than an index, it’s no guarantee and higher costs may result in worse performance. You can mix and match passive and active strategies based on your preferences. ETFs—With an ETF, you own a single security representing a basket of underlying securities that track an index. The main difference between mutual funds and ETFs is the way they're traded: mutual fund trades are processed at the end of the day; ETFs trade like stocks any time during the trading day. ETFs are also professionally managed—most passively similar to index mutual funds—but there are some actively managed ETFs. Another important consideration is cost. Index funds generally have low fees; actively managed funds can cost a pretty penny. In the case of small-cap or international markets active managers may have better odds to beat an index, but low costs are still important. However you invest, the advantages of low cost investing compound and can make a big difference in your returns over time. Always read the prospectus to understand the fee structure and how your money is invested. Lastly, even if a mutual fund or ETF has low fees, you may be charged a commission when you buy or sell. Taking the next step There are other types of investments, but stocks, bonds and cash are the core building blocks of an investment portfolio to implement asset allocation and diversification. Next week, I'll talk about types of accounts, taxes, and staying on top of your investments. Then you should be ready to get started! Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': \"Last week, U.S. Treasury bond yields, climbed back to their pre-pandemic levels. In Europe, German 10-year yields climbed to near 0%, touching their highest level since May 2019. What are the implications of rising global yields for stock prices? Increasing yields could help lift stocks and may even signal outperformance of cyclical European stocks and value stocks. The end of an era? Interest rates and stocks have moved together for the past 20 years, but this hasn't always been the case. In the prior multi-decade period, from the 1970s into the 1990s, when interest rates went up, stocks generally fell. Changing relationship between stock prices and bond yields Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 1/17/2022. Stocks = MSCI World Index (S&P 500 prior to 1970) Bonds = 10 year US Treasury bond yield The relationship between bond yields and stocks prices has changed over time. So, how can we tell if the current era may be ending? Well, the ten-year U.S. Treasury yield remains well below 5% and historically, that has been the threshold for a change in the relationship. Same direction — When rates were below 5%, both in the 1960s and since 2000, stock prices and bond yields tended to move in sync with each other (a positive correlation). Opposite directions — When rates were above 5% in the 1970-90s, stock prices and bond yields tended to move in opposite directions (a negative correlation). The only exception to this was the period around the 1987 stock market crash, when stocks and yields moved together. However, these circumstances were unique; the market decline was not precipitated by an economic recession-driven drop in bond yields. Why does 5% matter? The different eras may be the result of the changing relationship between yields and the economic outlook. Stock returns typically move in sync with the outlook for economic growth because economic growth is reflected in corporate earnings, which are one of the most important drivers of stock market performance. However, bond yields have become increasingly cyclical over time. In the current era, the U.S. Treasury bond yield and the world's leading economic indicators have moved in sync. Prior to the 1990s they moved in opposite directions. This phenomenon is seen with global growth and U.S. bond yields, as well as within Europe. Bond yields have become increasingly cyclical over time Source: Charles Schwab, Macrobond and Bloomberg data as of 1/17/2022. World = Total Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Leading Economic Indicator Europe = Europe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Leading Economic Indicator Today, U.S. 10-year yields are still well below 5%. Even more importantly, we expect the relationship between bond yields and economic activity to remain positive, maintaining the current era in which bond yields and stock prices generally move in the same direction. We believe global bond yields have more upside, even if inflation slows in 2022, as we expect. Although in Europe and the U.S., long-term inflation expectations have been flat for the past three months, the outlook for the real yield (10-year Treasury yield minus 10-year inflation expectations) is driving higher as confidence grows in the economic growth outlook and monetary policy begins normalization. Now, runaway global inflation could still pose a risk. If inflation does not stabilize in 2022, the subsequent increase in yields could turn negative for stocks and for the economic outlook. The current scenario does have the potential to herald the return to a negative correlation between stock prices and bond yields. What to do? An investment implication of rising bond yields is that investors should consider an overweight to their stock allocation. Note that rising rates have historically accompanied the outperformance of European stocks compared to the U.S. and within European stocks, outperformance of value stocks over growth stocks. This is largely attributed to the greater cyclicality of both European equities and value stocks. The ten-year European bond yield, which has been in decline since 2007 may be starting a meaningful rise, a possible indication that European value stocks could begin to outperform growth stocks, as you can see in the chart below. Reversal of rates to reverse growth/value performance? Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 1/17/2022. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. U.S. and global benchmark yields are gaining traction, moving higher along with positive global economic sentiment. Because they are still low by historical standards, we believe they will still be positively correlated to market returns. In this rate environment, economically sensitive stocks, such as European stocks and value stocks, may be poised to outperform based on historical patterns. While rising inflation could risk breaking down this correlation, investors may want to consider increasing their overall stock allocation, with a focus on more cyclical areas of the market.

       "   'abstract': 'Here’s a calendar of financial tips and tasks for the year, including important deadlines and changes.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Would you like to manage your money more thoughtfully, but aren't quite sure how to do it? Here are some guidelines to get you started and help you stay engaged with your finances throughout the year ahead. 1. Set SMART financial goals The first step is to set financial goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound, or SMART. The idea is not just to proclaim a goal, but to give yourself benchmarks against which you can measure your progress. Using the SMART approach will force you to be more precise about what you want to achieve and give you less room to make excuses should you fall short. Here's an example to get you started: Vague goal: Contribute to my 401(k) each month. SMART goal: Contribute 5% of my salary to my 401(k) each month in order to receive my employer's full matching contribution. The goal is specific: If you don't already know your employer's matching percentage, ask your Human Resources department. The goal is measurable: You can easily see whether you're having enough deducted from your paycheck each month to get the match. The goal is likely achievable, since it's a small percentage of your pay and can be automatically withheld. The goal is relevant, since saving for retirement is among the most important financial issues anyone will face. The goal is time-bound, because you've committed to contributing a specific amount each month. Be sure to take the time to actually write down your SMART goals, which will form the basis of your financial plan. Research has shown that creating a written financial plan is more effective than simply thinking or talking about your goals. Indeed, 65% of people who have a written financial plan say they feel financially stable, whereas 40% of those without a plan feel the same way, according to Schwab's 2021 Modern Wealth Survey. 2. Make a plan to achieve your goals Once you've set SMART goals, rank them in order of priority and assign a price tag to each. Start with your needs; then include your wants and wishes. This will give you a sense of how much money you'll need to save each month to achieve them. The key here is to arrive at a number that you can realistically stick to—and then committing to your target with a written financial plan. Even if your goals are challenging, trust that it's better to make progress gradually, month by month, than to do nothing and hope for the best. That said, if this exercise reveals that your plans are simply too much of a stretch, then you know it's time to adjust. For example, if your home-buying plans give you sticker shock, you might want to reconsider your housing budget or give yourself more time to save for the down payment. If the cost of a child's education looks too challenging, you might need to spend more time investigating grants, loans, and scholarships. Or maybe you'll see places in your monthly spending where you could scale back. Be sure to root your plan in realistic assumptions as well. For example, how much can you expect to earn on your retirement portfolio each year? How much will a four-year college education cost, on average, by the time your child is ready to enroll? Historical rates are a good starting point for such projections, as are retirement and college savings calculators. In the case of stock market returns, however, past performance may not be indicative of what you can expect in the future. Many analysts—including those at Charles Schwab Investment Advisory—expect much slower growth in the next decade. It can also be useful to look at different scenarios when making your projections. If you can reach your retirement goal with your current contributions and a 6.5% annual return on your investment portfolio, for example, it might be good to look at how a 5% return would affect your situation. If even a slightly smaller annual return would leave you far short of your goal, you may want to consider upping your savings target to account for that possibility. 3. Stay engaged with your finances all year Of course, plans don't count for much if you don't stick to them. So, consider creating financial calendar for yourself. This could offer two benefits: It'll keep you engaged with your finances and break your efforts into more manageable tasks spread out across the year. We've broken some of the more common tasks into quarterly chunks to give you an example of how this might work: First quarter (January–March) Portfolio review. The start of the year is a good time to check on your investment portfolio. Does it have a mix of assets that matches your risk tolerance? If investment gains or losses have caused the portfolio to stray from your intended allocation, bring your portfolio back into balance by selling some assets that have overperformed and using those funds to buy assets that haven't done as well. Taxes. If you're self-employed or if your paycheck withholding isn't going to cover all your earnings, incentive pay, and investment income, you should pay taxes on a quarterly basis. These are due on January 15. Health care. Funds in your flexible spending account (FSA) are use-it-or-lose-it. You usually have until March 15 to spend unused balances from the previous year, so the start of the first quarter is a good time to check on what's left. Money in a health savings account (HSA), on the other hand, doesn't expire. Credit reports. It's important to pay attention to your creditworthiness. You're entitled to a free credit report every year from each of the three big credit reporting companies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion), so why not space them out? You should also be watching your credit score regularly, which is easy to do, as many credit card companies now provide free access to scores. Second quarter (April–June) Taxes. When the second quarter begins, the annual tax filing deadline is usually imminent (April 15). Retirement. Tax Day is usually also the last day you can contribute to an individual retirement account (IRA) for the prior tax year. You can contribute up to $6,000, plus an additional $1,000 if you're age 50 or older. Insurance. Consider doing a policy checkup. Are your home, auto, and life insurance policies adequate to protect you? Life events such as divorce, marriage, or illness can affect what you need. Social Security. It's good to review your Social Security benefits at least once a year, checking for errors but also keeping track of how much you can count on for retirement (which you should include in your financial plan). Credit reports. Consider requesting your second credit report. Third quarter (July–September) Taxes. If you're self-employed or paying estimated taxes for some other reason, look at whether your contributions are on track. You still have time to set aside more so you don't face an ugly surprise at the end of the year. Check your progress. Now that half the year is behind you, check your progress toward your goals. If you're falling behind on any of them, revisit your financial plan to see where you might need to adjust. Credit reports. Consider requesting your third credit report. Fourth quarter (October–December) Health care. If you need to make any changes to your FSA or HSA savings or health insurance coverage, you can generally do so during open enrollment periods in late fall. Take this opportunity to reexamine how you're using all these benefits. Taxes. Start thinking about any tax-deductible donations you want to make while you still have time to do research and aren't distracted by the holidays. You can also take advantage of tax opportunities before year-end, such as tax-loss harvesting, to manage taxes before year-end. Estate planning. If you have a will, check to see if it's up to date. If not, consider getting one. Take the opportunity to also make sure the beneficiaries named on retirement accounts or life insurance are up to date. Get moral support Having a plan to refer back to, update, and monitor is the first step toward being a better money manager. Now get some help keeping yourself accountable by telling someone about your goals and plans. Behavioral science research shows we're much better at sticking to our goals when we share our intentions with a relative or friend. Enlisting someone to help hold ourselves accountable.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Find out what traders should watch for during earnings season.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Happy earnings season, traders! Consistent earnings are arguably the most important driver of individual stock performance—and by extension, the performance of the overall stock market—over the long run. If most companies, particularly the established market leaders, report increasing sales and earnings, traders tend to feel more confident about the market’s prospects. When earnings are trending below expectations, it can be a warning sign of potential trouble ahead. Here, we look at the three things that traders should track during earnings season: whether companies\\' reported results are broadly in line with expectations across the market, how bellwether companies are performing, and individual earnings surprises. Performance relative to expectations Analysts spend a lot of time estimating how well a given company or industry is likely to perform in terms of generating earnings and sales. As a result, when earnings season begins, there are already built-in expectations among the investing public about how earnings should look overall. If the results companies report are generally in line with analysts\\' positive expectations or exceed them, this can be a sign of an improving environment for the stock market and business overall. When disappointing reports start to pile up, it can have a chilling effect on investors over the course of the next quarter or longer. This may all seem obvious enough, but it\\'s worth noting that there are both fundamental and psychological reasons for these dynamics. On one hand, earnings and sales growth on their own can be fundamental drivers of stock prices. On the other, perceptions of strength relative to expectations also matter, so that traders might punish a company that reports growing earnings that nevertheless fall short, or reward one that loses less money than they’d feared. Bellwether performance Certain companies and industries are thought of as \"bellwethers,\" meaning they are considered broadly representative of the health of the stock market and overall business activity. Classic examples from the last century include General Motors and IBM, though today analysts are more likely to look at companies like Microsoft or Apple. If a bellwether is doing well, the thinking goes, so is the market, and vice versa. Think of it as another perspective on the market. Individual earnings surprises Many traders plan and prepare for earnings seasons by knowing what is expected of the stocks they\\'re tracking. As noted, surprises, whether positive or negative, can have a profound impact on the performance of individual stocks—potentially enough to push them into a new rising or falling trend. Be aware that companies can report results when markets aren\\'t even open, which can cause their stocks to \"gap,\" or make a sharp move up or down with no trading occurring in between. One way to protect yourself against a precipitous slide in the event of negative surprise is to set up a stop-limit order, which is an order to sell a security at a specified limit price once the security has traded at or through a specified stop price. If a stock trades at or below the stop price, the order will trigger and become a limit order to sell at the price you\\'ve specified. However, your order won\\'t be executed unless a buyer is willing to pay the limit price you\\'ve specified (or better). If no buyers will pay your price, your order won’t be executed. Stocks that \"gap up,\" on the other hand, may present a great selling opportunity. To prepare for these situations, some traders consider using a trailing stop that trails the bid price of the stock as it moves higher. The stop price essentially self-adjusts and remains below the market price by the number of points or the percentage that you specify, as long as the stock is moving higher. Once the stock begins to move lower, the stop price freezes at the highest level it reaches. In other words, the stop price can move higher indefinitely, but it can never move lower.'},\n",

That\\'s the idea behind a technique from the behavioral sciences known as a \"nudge.\" Broadly speaking, a nudge is a way of framing choices that subtly favors the more desirable outcome. It can be a way of encouraging people to do what\\'s in their best interest—even when other perfectly human tendencies, such as the urge to procrastinate, are conspiring against them—without taking away the ability to choose otherwise. Governments and companies use nudge theory to encourage people to make socially desirable or individually beneficial choices, whether the goal is to boost organ donation or get people to save more for retirement. And these techniques can work, as we\\'ll see below. The good news for investors is that the ideas behind nudges can help people make better saving and investing decisions for themselves, even without outside involvement. Here we\\'ll look at how nudges work and offer some tips investors can use to bring this technique to bear on their portfolios. Anatomy of a nudge Nudges had their moment in the public spotlight thanks to the book \"Nudge,\" by Nobel Prize–winning economist Richard Thaler and law professor Cass Sunstein. The book explains how findings from the worlds of psychology and behavioral science could help people make better choices with their money, health and other issues. Several countries have since set up \"nudge units\" to inject such thinking into public policymaking. Thaler and Sunstein explain that people have two modes of thinking: The reflective system, in which longer-term, more deliberative thought happens; and the automatic system, where quick, instinctive decisions are made. Unfortunately, these two systems don\\'t always cooperate. The automatic system likes the status quo and tends to shy away from anything that might delay gratification—which can lead to decisions that might feel good in the moment but aren\\'t good for our longer-term interests. So, whereas our reflective system might grasp the need to save for retirement, our automatic system insists on another dinner on the town with a promise to save more next month. That\\'s where nudges can come in. If you can frame a decision in a way that makes it easy for the automatic system to gravitate toward the more desirable choice, you can set yourself up for success. It\\'s a question of putting the best outcome along the path of least resistance and letting the automatic system do its thing. Opt in/opt out A common nudge is to reframe opt-in/opt-out defaults for programs that involve enrollment decisions. Organ-donation programs in Europe offer an example. One study found that countries where people must choose to become organ donors—say, by filling out forms, making calls or mailing documents—end up with far fewer registered donors than countries where adults are automatically registered as donors but can choose to opt out.1 Opt-in countries such as Denmark, the U.K. and Germany all had participation rates below 18%. In contrast, opt-out countries such as Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, and Poland had participation rates of 98% or above. In all cases, adults were free to choose whether to become donors, and the differences weren\\'t based on cultural preferences or educational campaigns. In fact, the study notes that the Netherlands, which had an opt-in system, launched an extensive campaign to boost organ donor registration—with little effect. The opt-out countries simply realized that when the brain\\'s automatic system meets some paperwork or a bit of effort, it tends to recoil. Stacking that paperwork in front of the exit rather than the entrance can help keep enrollment high. Companies have had similar results with 401(k) programs. A study of four companies found that asking employees to opt out of 401(k) programs instead of opting in boosted participation rates for new employees from less than half to almost 90%.2 \"Opt out plans\" have since become the norm: 62% of employer-sponsored retirement plans used automatic enrollment as of 2020, according to data from the Plan Sponsor Council of America (PSCA), compared with less than 42% in 2010. Other kinds of nudges can also boost savings. For example, asking workers to commit to saving pay raises can also encourage them to save more.3 Adjusting the default savings rate and employer matches can also help overcome procrastination and prompt more saving.4 These are all examples where a thoughtfully designed default option—the easier option—helped people save more without forcing their hand or taking away their freedom to choose. Investor, nudge thyself Nudging is a powerful idea—which is all well and good if you\\'re already being nudged. But what if you want to nudge yourself? You have some options. After all, saving and investing can be kind of like striking a deal with your current self on behalf of your future self. Every dollar you invest is a dollar you can\\'t spend today—but the payoff in the future could be worth it. So why not make it easier to save with a nudge? Think of it as your future self nudging your current self. Then again, it also works in reverse: Your reflective system probably already knows you must save, so how can you nudge your future self to stay on track? Here are some ideas: Lean into the nudge. If you\\'ve already automatically been enrolled in a 401(k), stick with it. One thing working in savers\\' favor these days is that the most common default savings rate for workplace retirement plans is now 6%, according to the PSCA, rather than 3% rate that had been the norm since 2006. But even at that level, you may want to go a little higher—say an extra percentage point or two. Use automatic contributions. This may already be a feature of your 401(k) account, but you can also use it with other kinds of investments or savings accounts. Setting up automatic monthly contributions, say, can help you accumulate savings and take advantage of strategies such as dollar cost averaging. And most importantly, it can pre-empt an urge to delay saving. It\\'s hard for the automatic system to spend the money if the reflective system has already put it to use. Use annual step-ups. Consider increasing the contributions to your savings and investment accounts over time. One approach developed by Thaler and the behavioral economist Shlomo Benartzi asks participants to commit to saving pay increases.5 Or you could just boost your 401(k) contribution by a percentage point each year. Be specific about your goals. A large body of research shows people who set concrete goals that are difficult to achieve end up doing better than those who set unambitious or vague goals.6 Think of it this way: Your goal should be specific enough that you can tell whether you\\'re on or off track. Create prompts for yourself to rebalance and review. Use your mobile device to send yourself annual reminders to revisit your financial plans, think about your goals and risk tolerance, and, if necessary, rebalance your portfolio. Use guardrails if you\\'re trading stock. Think about committing to a trade plan that restricts how much you\\'re trading and sets price thresholds that can help you keep your emotions at bay when markets shift. For example, you can try to protect your downside using stop orders, which are orders to buy or sell a stock at the market price once the stock has traded at or through a specified price (the \"stop price\"). If the stock reaches the stop price, the order becomes a market order and is filled at the next available market price. Another idea is when you buy stock, decide in advance the conditions under which you would sell it. 1Eric J.

       "   'content': 'You\\'ve got a sense of your ideal retirement age. And you\\'ve probably made certain plans based on that timeline. But what if you\\'re forced to retire sooner than you expect? Early retirement is nothing new, but it\\'s clear how much the COVID-19 pandemic has affected an aging workforce. Whether due to downsizing, objections to vaccine mandates, concerns about exposure risks, other health issues, or the desire for more leisure time, the retired population grew by 3.5 million over the past two years—compared to an annual average of 1 million between 2008 and 2019—according to the Pew Research Center.1 At the same time, a survey conducted by the National Institute on Retirement Security revealed that more than half of Americans are concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their ability to achieve a secure retirement.2 There\\'s no need to panic, but those numbers make one thing clear, says Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Flexible and personalized financial planning that addresses how you\\'d cope if you had to retire early can help you make the best use of all your resources. Here are six steps to follow. We\\'ll use as an example a person who\\'s seeing if they could retire five years early, but the steps remain the same regardless of your individual time frame. Step 1: Think strategically about pension and Social Security benefits For most retirees, Social Security and (to a lesser degree) pensions are the two primary sources of regular income in retirement. You usually can collect these payments early—at age 62 for Social Security and sometimes as early as age 55 with a pension. However, taking benefits early will mean that you get smaller monthly benefits for the rest of your life. That can matter to your bottom line, even if you expect Social Security to be merely the icing on your retirement cake. On the Social Security website, you can find a projection of what your benefits would be if you were pushed to claim them several years early. But if you\\'re part of a two-income couple, you may want to make an appointment at a Social Security office or with a financial professional to weigh the potential options. For example, when you die, your spouse is eligible to receive your monthly benefit if it\\'s higher than his or her own. But if you claim your benefits early, thus receiving a reduced amount, you\\'re likewise limiting your spouse\\'s potential survivor benefit. If you have a pension, your employer\\'s pension administrator can help estimate your monthly pension payments at various ages. Once you have these estimates, you\\'ll have a good idea of how much monthly income you can count on at any given point in time. Step 2: Pressure-test your 401(k) In addition to weighing different strategies to maximize your Social Security and/or pension, evaluate how much income you could potentially derive from your personal retirement savings—and there\\'s a silver lining here if you\\'re forced to retire early. Rule of 55 Let\\'s say you leave your job at any time during or after the calendar year you turn 55 (or age 50 if you\\'re a public safety employee with a government defined-benefit plan). Under a little-known separation-of-service provision, often referred to as the \"rule of 55,\" you may be able take distributions (though some plans may allow only one lump-sum withdrawal) from your 401(k), 403(b), or other qualified retirement plan free of the usual 10% early-withdrawal penalties. However, be aware that you\\'ll still owe ordinary income taxes on the amount distributed. This exception applies only to the plan (including any consolidated accounts) that you were contributing to when you separated from service. It does not extend to IRAs. 4% rule There\\'s also a simple rule of thumb suggesting that if you spend 4% or less of your savings in your first year of retirement and then adjust for inflation each year following, your savings are likely to last for at least 30 years—given that you make no other changes to your withdrawals, such as a lump sum withdrawal for a one-time expense or a slight reduction in withdrawals during a down market. To see how much monthly income you could count on if you retired as expected in five years, multiply your current savings by 4% and divide by 12. For example, $1 million x .04 = $40,000. Divide that by 12 to get $3,333 per month in year one of retirement. (Again, you could increase that amount with inflation each year thereafter.) Then do the same calculation based on your current savings to see how much you\\'d have to live on if you retired today. Keep in mind that your money will have to last five years longer in this instance. Knowing the monthly amount your current savings can generate will give you a clearer sense of whether you\\'ll have a shortfall—and how large or small it might be. Use our retirement savings calculator to test different saving amounts and time frames. Step 3: Don\\'t forget about health insurance Nobody wants to spend down a big chunk of their retirement savings on unanticipated healthcare costs in the years between early retirement and Medicare eligibility at age 65. If you lose your employer-sponsored health insurance, you\\'ll want to find some coverage until you can apply for Medicare. Your options may include continuing employer-sponsored coverage through COBRA, insurance enrollment through the Health Insurance Marketplace at HealthCare.gov, or joining your spouse\\'s health insurance plan. You may also find discounted coverage through organizations you belong to—for example, the AARP. Step 4: Create a post-retirement budget To make sure your retirement savings will cover your expenses, add up the monthly income you could get from pensions, Social Security, and your savings. Then, compare the total to your anticipated monthly expenses (including income taxes) if you were to retire five years early and are eligible, and choose to file, for Social Security and pension benefits earlier. Take into account various life events and expenditures you may encounter. You may not pay off your mortgage by the date you\\'d planned. Your spouse might still be working (which can add income but also prolong certain expenses). Or your children might not be out of college yet. You\\'re probably fine if you anticipate that your monthly expenses will be lower than your income. But if you think your expenses would be higher than your early-retirement income, Rob suggests that you take one or more of these measures: Retire later. Save more now to fill some of the potential gap. Trim your budget so there\\'s less of a gap down the road. Consider options for consulting or part-time work—and begin to explore some of those opportunities now. To the last point, finding a job later in life can be challenging, but certain employment agencies specialize in this area. If you can find work you like that covers a portion of your expenses, you\\'ll have the option of delaying Social Security and your company pension to get higher payments later—and you can avoid dipping into your retirement savings prematurely. Step 5: Protect your portfolio When you retire early, you have to walk a fine line with your portfolios asset allocation—investing aggressively enough that your money has the potential to grow over a long retirement, but also conservatively enough to minimize the chance of big losses, particularly at the outset. \"Risk management is especially important during the first few years of retirement or if you retire early,\" Rob notes, because it can be difficult to bounce back from a loss when you\\'re drawing down income from your portfolio and reducing the overall number of shares you own. To strike a balance between growth and security, start by making sure you have enough money stashed in relatively liquid, relatively stable investments—such as money market accounts, CDs, or high-quality short-term bonds—to cover at least a year or two of living expenses. Divide the rest of your portfolio among stocks, bonds, and other fixed-income investments. And don\\'t hesitate to seek professional help to arrive at the right mix.

Step 6: Reevaluate your current spending Many people are unaccustomed to thinking about their expenses because they simply spend what they make when working, Rob says. But one of the most valuable decisions you can make about your life in retirement is to reevaluate where your money is going now. This serves two aims. First, it\\'s a reality check on the spending plan you\\'ve envisioned for retirement, which may be idealized (e.g., \"I\\'ll do all the home maintenance and repairs!\"). Second, it enables you to adjust your spending habits ahead of schedule—whichever schedule you end up following. This gives you more control and potentially more income. For example, if you\\'re not averse to downsizing, moving to a less expensive home could reduce your monthly mortgage, property tax, and insurance payments while freeing up equity that could also be invested to provide additional monthly income. \"When you are saving for retirement, time is on your side,\" Rob says. You lose that advantage when you\\'re forced to retire early, but having a backup plan that anticipates the possibility of an early retirement can make the unknowns you face a lot less daunting. 1Richard Fry, \"Amid the Pandemic, A Rising Share Of Older U.S. Adults Are Now Retired\", Pew Research Center, 11/04/2021, https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/04/amid-the-pandemic-a-rising-share-of-older-u-s-adults-are-now-retired/. 2Tyler Bond, Don Doonan and Kelly Kenneally, \"Retirement Insecurity 2021: Americans\\' Views of Retirement\", Nirsonline.Org, 02/2021, https://www.nirsonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FINAL-Retirement-Insecurity-2021-.pdf.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Most of us know we should save money. But when it comes to actually doing it, people tend to fall into two camps: non-planners and planners. Non-planners typically save when they can, perhaps putting a small amount into a workplace retirement plan, hoping that everything will work out in the long run. Planners generally know what they\\'re saving for, how much they need to put away, and how long it will take them to reach their goals. Does the first type sound more like you? If so, you\\'re not alone: Only 33% of Americans have a written financial plan, according to Schwab\\'s 2021 Modern Wealth Survey.1 Of the rest, almost half said they didn\\'t have enough money to make a plan worthwhile. Others said it was too complicated, or they didn\\'t have time to develop a plan. Respondents face various roadblocks to creating a financial plan Source: 2021 Schwab Modern Wealth Survey. In the rush of daily life, planning for anything more than a few days in advance can seem like a headache. It\\'s natural to wonder: Does financial planning really help? We think it does. Here are five reasons why: 1. A written financial plan increases confidence Our survey found that 65% of people with a written financial plan say they feel financially stable, while only 40% of those without a plan feel the same level of comfort. Fifty-four percent of planners felt \"very confident\" they would reach their financial goals, compared with only 18% of non-planners. Having a written financial plan gives you a measurable goal to work toward. Because you can track your progress, you can reduce doubt or uncertainty about your decisions and make adjustments to help overcome obstacles that could derail you. 2. A financial plan can jumpstart savings, even with a small amount of money The most common reason cited for not having a plan is \"I don\\'t have enough money.\" This is a misconception. Planning, even in small steps, doesn\\'t take large sums of money to start. In fact, financial planning can have a profound impact on lower-income households by helping people improve their saving and budgeting habits. A written plan helps savers prioritize their goals and, as mentioned earlier, provides a way to gauge success. 3. A financial plan can help you create an investment portfolio Your financial plan can give you the full lay of the land: You\\'ll know what your goals are, how much time you have to reach them, and how comfortable you are with risk. Once you have a comprehensive view, you can figure out how to reach each individual goal. That will involve both saving—setting aside money you\\'ll need in the short term or for emergencies—as well as investing, which is setting aside money you\\'ll need in the long term and that, ideally, can grow. And with your financial plan as a roadmap, you\\'ll be better able to make thoughtful investing decisions—instead of heading out without a sense of direction and just hoping for the best. 4. A financial plan can lead to better habits Financial planning isn\\'t just about investing; it\\'s about what money can do for your confidence, security, and quality of life—such as the protection that life insurance offers or the peace of mind that an emergency fund can provide. Research also shows that planning supports sound money habits as well. Americans who have a financial plan also have healthy money habits Source: 2021 Schwab Modern Wealth Survey. There are good investing habits, and there are healthy money habits. A written financial plan can lead to both. 5. Planning can be tailored to every personality type Your approach to life can influence every decision you make, including those that involve your finances. By understanding the type of person you are with regard to planning, you can take proper steps toward reaching your financial goals. Here are six types of financial planning personalities: Organizer: Organizers love lists. Categorizing and arranging everything from their sock drawer to their personal finances gives them a warm, fuzzy feeling. Architect: Architects are masters of both creativity and logic. They not only imagine the future but design solutions to make it happen. Philosopher: Taken from the Greek word meaning \"lover of wisdom,\" philosophers enjoy thinking about and solving problems. Dreamer: Dreamers are the free spirits of our world who shake their head in confusion at all those who schedule their lives to the last detail. Improviser: Improvisers are typically quite self-sufficient with a deep desire for independence and doing things their own way. Maverick: Mavericks are unafraid and unapologetic individuals who would rather reshape their world than try to fit in it. What\\'s your financial personality type? Take Schwab\\'s Modern Wealth Quiz. How can you plan according to your personality? For organizers, architects, and philosophers, forethought and proactively finding solutions are in their nature. A written financial plan can offer a sense of security while leaving room for improvement and possible growth. Dreamers, improvisers, and mavericks may prefer spontaneity, but even a bit of planning can significantly help them achieve the freedom to live the way they want while fulfilling the future they imagine. A written plan can provide the structure to keep them financially grounded while allowing them to make changes on the fly or use their earnings to support a carefree lifestyle. Why consider a professional financial planner? Research has shown that households that work with a professional financial planner were more likely to make better financial decisions than those without a planner, taking into account portfolio risk levels, savings habits, life insurance coverage, revolving credit card balances, and emergency savings.2 In a study published in the Journal of Financial Planning, David M. Blanchett, Ph.D., CFA, CFP®, used six rounds of the triennial Federal Reserve Board\\'s Survey of Consumer Finances (from 2001 to 2016) to examine the results achieved by people using four information sources: financial planners (defined as advisors who provided more holistic services); transactional financial advisors (such as a banker or broker); friends; or the internet. \"Households working with a financial planner were found to be making the best overall financial decisions, followed by those using the internet, while those working with a transactional adviser were making the worst financial decisions,\" Blanchett wrote.

Bottom line A financial plan may sound like a chore. But for successful investors, it\\'s the foundation on which to build, understand and achieve your goals. Having a written plan can increase confidence and result in more constructive financial behavior. However, the potential value of financial advice may vary based on the nature of the planning engagement. People working with a financial planner who is taking a holistic look at their needs, beyond just products and portfolio, are likely better off than those working with a planner who takes a transactional approach.

       "   'abstract': 'Our experts answer common questions about Social Security to help you maximize your retirement benefits.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Social Security can be a complex topic, so it pays to ask questions and understand the answers. Here are some of the more common ones. 1. Who\\'s eligible to receive Social Security benefits? To qualify, you or your spouse must have worked in jobs covered by Social Security and paid the Social Security payroll tax for at least 10 years (those years needn\\'t be consecutive). A nonworking spouse is potentially entitled to up to half of the working spouse\\'s benefit. To collect benefits, you must generally be age 62 or older, disabled, or blind. 2. How are benefits calculated? There are two formulas at work: one based on your 35 highest-earning years indexed for inflation and another that transforms that calculation into the monthly benefit estimates we understand. The bottom line is the more you earn over your lifetime, the more you can expect to receive from Social Security. Higher earnings in the years just prior to retiring may increase your benefit, too. That said, there\\'s a limit to the amount of annual income that qualifies for the Social Security calculation. The taxable maximum is $142,800 for 2021 and $147,000 in 2022.1 If you earn more than the annual maximum in a given year as an employee, the income above that threshold won\\'t be subject to the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax (for the self-employed, the rate is 12.4%). 3. How can I increase my benefit? Although there\\'s nothing you can do to revise your earnings history, there are other steps you can take to boost your Social Security payouts. Work longer: If you don\\'t yet have 35 years of income history, every additional year you work replaces a zero-income year. And if you\\'re currently earning your peak income, every additional year you work could replace a year in which your earnings were lower. Wait to collect: Although you can start collecting Social Security as early as age 62, waiting to collect will boost your monthly check. Receiving your benefits before full retirement age—which is between 66 and 67, depending on your birth year—will reduce your payment between 5% and 7% each year. If you can afford to wait, every year you delay past retirement age will increase your annual payout about 8% until age 70, when the benefit increases stop. You\\'ll receive from 24% to 32% more than if you had begun collecting at your full retirement age—and roughly 76% more than if you had begun collecting at 62. Of course, it\\'s not always possible to work longer or wait to collect. Those in poor health or who need the income to make ends meet, for example, might decide to take Social Security as soon as possible. When waiting pays off For those who live to age 76 or older, waiting to collect Social Security can be rewarding. But remember, Social Security isn\\'t just an investment or a break-even analysis. It\\'s a form of insurance to protect you by providing income that increases with inflation for as long as you live. Source: SSA.gov Hypothetical cumulative benefits assume the retiree was age 62 in 2022, age 67 in 2027, and age 70 in 2030 and began collecting a monthly benefit in January of each year. Monthly benefit for starting at age 62 would be $2,364 compared to $3,751 at age 67 and $4,953 at age 70. Benefits increase by 2.12% annually to account for inflation. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. Monthly benefit at any age varies widely by individual based on their earning history. 4. What\\'s a good strategy for spouses? A lot of couples want to start collecting both spouses\\' Social Security right away, but doing so may not be the best choice if one of you earned significantly more than the other. It often makes sense for the higher-earning spouse to wait as long as possible—up to age 70. Depending on health and finances, the lower-earning spouse can collect benefits earlier. After the death of one spouse—regardless of whether it was the lower- or higher-earning one—the surviving spouse receives the larger of the two benefits for the remainder of his or her lifetime. There are other factors and strategies to consider when filing for benefits as a couple. A financial planner or National Social Security Advisor can help you weigh your options. 5. Can my kids inherit my Social Security benefit? In addition to your spouse, dependent children and even grandchildren may be eligible to receive benefits when you die, become disabled, or retire. To qualify, your dependent must be unmarried and meet certain age requirements: Be under age 18; Or under age 19 and attending a primary or secondary school full time; Or any age if they were disabled before the age of 22 For minors, payments stop when they turn 18. For students, payments end when they graduate or two months after their 19th birthday, whichever comes first. For dependents with a disability, payments continue until they marry. \"The rules are complex, especially around disability,\" cautions Rob Williams, CFP® and managing director of financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. He recommends consulting the appropriate benefit specialists at the Social Security Administration (SSA). 6. Is Social Security going to run out of money? According to the SSA, the surplus in the two Social Security trust funds—the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, which pays retirement and survivors benefits, and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, which pays disability benefits—will be exhausted in 2034.2 However, \"exhausted\" is a relative term. It doesn\\'t mean that benefits are projected to stop. As of August 2021, Social Security would still be able to pay out 78% of current and future benefits.3 \"We believe, as do most analysts, that Social Security will continue to pay—but there may be changes, depending on action from Congress,\" says Rob. That could mean later retirement dates for future recipients, reduced benefits for retirees who can afford it, or increases to the Social Security payroll tax to raise more money. \"Lawmakers may well do something in each of those three categories,\" adds Rob, \"though it\\'s unlikely that benefits would go away entirely.\" Of course, if you\\'re worried about potential changes, there\\'s one sensible way to try to hedge against that risk: save more. \"Today, there\\'s a greater individual burden than ever before to save for retirement,\" says Rob. \"It\\'s important to fully understand and plan for your Social Security benefit but just as necessary to understand that it was never intended to be your sole source of retirement income.\" 1\"Contribution and Benefit Base\", ssa.gov, 12/08/2021, https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/cbb.html. 2\"Trustees Report Summary\", ssa.gov, 12/08/2021, https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/. 3Ibid.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, For those of you new to investing, I know it can be exciting, challenging and sometimes a bit overwhelming. After all, investing doesn’t generally come naturally. It\\'s not like riding a bike. The reality is that the language of investing is often obscure and the rules and regulations can be complicated. That said, investing is the best way I know to build wealth. So I\\'m offering a three-part series to help you crack the code—starting with the most important foundational concepts. Then in the next two columns I\\'ll define and describe the investments, accounts, and steps to take to put these concepts to use. If you\\'ve been afraid to ask questions and start investing, I encourage you to read on. The challenge is worth the effort. A few words about risk Like everything in life, investing carries risk. The only way to have a chance at a gain is to take the chance of having a loss. Sometimes more risk means the potential for more gain—but not always. As an investor, your most important job is to understand how and when to take on smart risk—risk that\\'s appropriate for your situation and that carries the potential for commensurate reward. Get more from Ask Carrie. Go to Ask Carrie hub Two cornerstone concepts for building a portfolio—asset allocation and diversification Asset allocation and diversification may sound complicated, but the concepts behind them are quite simple. Plus, they are the most important building blocks for creating a portfolio. 1) Asset allocation: Building an investment portfolio is a bit like building a house; you need a master plan. In investing, this master plan is your asset allocation, or the way you divvy up your money between various asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, cash. Your asset allocation can range from aggressive to conservative and will help determine both your level of risk as well as your potential for gain. Here are some examples: An aggressive asset allocation is made up largely of stocks, which carry significant risk of loss and higher volatility but also the potential for significant growth. This would be appropriate for someone young and saving for retirement because they can keep their money invested for the long term and ride out market ups and downs. At the other end of the spectrum, a conservative allocation is made up largely of investments that have less risk of loss as well as lower potential for growth. Investments such as U.S. Treasury bonds, CDs, or other types of fixed income investments are more stable than stocks. These investments are most appropriate for an older person with a shorter time to keep their money invested or someone who has a short-term goal. These types of investments can also add ballast to a stock portfolio. A moderate portfolio falls somewhere in between. As an investor, selecting and adhering to your chosen asset allocation is job number one. Before you decide to buy an investment, ask yourself, \"Will stock XYZ or fund ABC fit into my asset allocation and provide enough potential growth to justify its risk?\" If not, it\\'s not the investment for you. 2) Diversification: In plain English, diversification means not putting all your eggs in one basket; in other words, spreading your risk among many different types of investments that aren’t likely to go up or down at the same time. In practice this means owning lots of stocks and/or bonds, each with different characteristics. Even if you want to invest aggressively, it\\'s more prudent to have a portfolio that\\'s globally diversified across a wide variety of industries and sectors of the economy rather than owning a small handful of companies. Diversification isn\\'t a magic bullet; it can\\'t guarantee a profit or eliminate the risk of loss. However, if you don\\'t diversify, you\\'re setting yourself up for a huge hit if your chosen investment falters. (If any one investment equals more than 10 percent of your portfolio\\'s value, that\\'s known as a concentrated position—a red flag!) As I\\'ll discuss in the next column, purchasing mutual funds or exchange-traded funds is an efficient way to diversify, and can provide the foundation for your portfolio regardless of what kind of investor you are. Why you shouldn\\'t try to time the market There\\'s a saying, \"time in the market is more important than timing the market.\" Before you invest a penny, repeat those words. Even the most experienced investors can\\'t accurately predict how much and when the market will move in a particular direction. So what\\'s an investor to do? Get in and stay in. Missing out on even a few days of the market can be costly. Missing just the top 10 days of the market represented by the S&P 500 from 2001-2020 would have changed an investor\\'s return from 7.5% to 3.4%. With an asset allocation that matches your risk tolerance and time horizon, you don’t need to constantly monitor and tinker with your portfolio. Dollar-cost averaging: A prudent strategy especially for new investors Sometimes getting started can be the hardest part of investing. The good news is you don\\'t have to jump in with both feet. A strategy known as dollar-cost averaging can help you ease in over time. Here\\'s how it works: every month (or any regular interval), you invest a set amount of money—regardless of how the stock market is performing. When the market is down and prices are low, you can buy more shares for your money. When the market and prices are up, you\\'ll buy fewer shares. For example, let\\'s say you invest $400 a month for a year. In the first month, you purchase 40 shares of Stock XYZ at $10 per share. If the price goes up to $12 in month two, you\\'ll only purchase 33.33 shares. If the price falls to $8, you\\'ll purchase 50 shares. The key is holding steady at $400 every month. Despite the inherent volatility of the stock market, it tends to go up over time. Of course, no strategy, dollar-cost averaging included, can protect against losses when stock prices tumble. The best course of action is to create an appropriate plan and take action on that plan by getting invested—and staying invested. Coming up next In this column I\\'ve introduced concepts that will be the foundation of your success as an investor. In the next two weeks you\\'ll learn ways to put these concepts to work.

       "   'abstract': 'Support your strategy and portfolio by knowing when to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), index funds, and actively managed mutual funds.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Investors looking for diversification often turn to the world of funds. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), index mutual funds and actively managed mutual funds can provide broad, diversified exposure to an asset class, region or specific market niche, without having to buy scores of individual securities. The challenge, however, lies in narrowing down your options. Do you choose an ETF that tracks an index, such as the S&P 500® Index—or a low-cost index mutual fund that does the same? Or perhaps a fundamentally weighted index ETF that may improve a portfolio’s overall risk-adjusted performance? Or maybe a mutual fund with stellar management? The answer depends on your goals and needs. Before you decide on the mix that’s right for you, let’s look at the benefits and potential drawbacks of each type of investment. ETFs ETFs trade like stocks and are primarily passive investments that seek to replicate the performance of a particular index (although actively managed ETFs are also available). A passive management style often results in lower expense ratios than those charged by actively managed funds. Some passive ETFs charge less than 0.05%, with some even charging 0.00%. That’s a sizeable advantage over actively managed funds that charge an average of 0.66%, according to Morningstar.1 Passive ETFs also tend to be tax efficient, in part because tracking an index usually doesn’t require frequent trading, and ETFs have a structural ability to minimize the capital gains they have to distribute. Historically, investing in ETFs has meant paying trading commissions every time ETF shares were bought or sold, but at Schwab and several other brokerages, listed ETFs now trade commission-free2. Consider investing in an ETF if: You trade actively. Intraday trades, stop orders, limit orders, and short selling are all possible with ETFs, but not with mutual funds. You want niche exposure. ETFs focused on specific industries or commodities can give you exposure to particular market niches. Niche investing often isn’t possible with index mutual funds, though some actively managed niche funds might be available. You want tax-efficiency. Both passive ETFs and index mutual funds are more tax efficient than actively managed funds. In general, ETFs can be even more tax efficient than index funds. Potential drawbacks in an ETF include: Some have large bid/ask spreads. When you purchase or sell ETF shares, the price you are given may be less than the underlying value of the ETF’s holdings (the net asset value, or NAV). This discrepancy—called the bid/ask spread—is often minuscule, but for niche ETFs that don’t get a lot of trading activity, the spread can be wide. Watch out for fee creep. Some ETFs use fee waivers to temporarily offer lower expense ratios to investors (termed the “net expense ratio”). Although these waivers are often extended, the fund sponsor may decide to allow the waiver to expire. If that’s the case, the expense ratio will increase from the “net” amount to a higher “gross” amount. Investors can find the net, gross and fee waiver expiration date (if applicable) in the ETF’s prospectus. Mutual funds Mutual funds are generally bought directly from investment companies instead of from other investors on an exchange. Unlike ETFs, they don’t have trading commissions, but they do carry an expense ratio and potentially other sales fees (or “loads”). Index mutual funds Like most ETFs, index mutual funds are considered passive investments because they mirror an index. They can also be a low-cost way to invest—many have annual expenses of less than 0.10%.3 A few scenarios where an index fund may be a better option than an ETF: You can buy an index mutual fund that has lower annual operating expenses. Don’t assume ETFs are always going to be the lowest-cost option. You may be able to find an index fund with lower costs than a comparable ETF. The ETF is thinly traded. As we covered earlier in the potential ETF drawbacks, you may have to consider the size of the bid/ask spread of a low-volume ETF before purchasing it. Mutual funds, by contrast, always trade at NAV without any bid-ask spreads. An index fund’s drawbacks are: It’ll never outpace the market. Since index funds are tied to the performance of an index, they’ll never be able to beat a top-performing actively managed fund. Index funds follow the tortoise’s “slow and steady wins the race” philosophy, and as a result can’t give you that thrilling short-term market-beating performance an actively managed fund might. You have no control over holdings. An index fund might not include a company or set of companies you like or believe will perform well. Conversely, companies you may not like might be included in an index. You have no control over the individual holdings in an index fund. You have no downside protection. While an index fund like the S&P 500 has proven to be a relatively sound long-term investment, you are still at the mercy of the market. When the market takes a downturn, so does your index fund. Actively managed mutual funds The investments in an actively managed mutual fund are selected and managed by a portfolio manager (or multiple managers), who are often supported by a team of research analysts. Active managers build a portfolio that reflects their strategy and outlook. For example, in rough markets, active managers can play defense by selling more speculative or risky assets and adding more conservative investments. Actively managed funds are typically more expensive than ETFs or index funds—in large part, to compensate management. Consider investing in an actively managed mutual fund if: You want a fund that could outperform the market. The main reason people invest in actively managed funds is the potential that they might beat their benchmarks (though most aren’t able to do so consistently). Additionally, active management with a specific strategy may complement index funds in a portfolio. For example, some managers aim to reduce downside risk and volatility. You are investing in a less efficient part of the market. Some markets are considered to be highly “efficient,” meaning the businesses or markets are so popular and information is so quickly and widely distributed that there isn’t much opportunity for active managers to add value. Large-cap U.S. stocks are an example of an efficient market segment. Emerging market stocks or high-yield bonds are less efficient markets where deep research and a proven strategy could pay off. Potential drawbacks of an actively managed mutual fund are: They could underperform the market. This is the flipside of an actively managed funds’ potential to beat the market. There is also the potential that it can underperform versus the market. They tend to have higher fees. As the name would suggest, actively managed funds are, well, actively managed, and those managers will be taking their fee with every adjustment they make to the fund. They are generally less tax efficient. Actively managed funds tend to have a higher tax cost than index funds because as a manager liquidates and purchases investments in an attempt to beat the market, capital gains are realized more frequently and those are taxed. The more activity in a fund, the more those taxes add up. 1 Morningstar’s April 2019 U.S. Fund Fee Study, published June 2020. 2 Standard online $0 commission does not apply to over-the-counter (OTC) equities, transaction-fee mutual funds, futures, fixed-income investments, or trades placed directly on a foreign exchange or in the Canadian market. Options trades will be subject to the standard $0.65 per-contract fee. Service charges apply for trades placed through a broker ($25) or by automated phone ($5). Exchange process, ADR, and Stock Borrow fees still apply. See the Charles Schwab Pricing Guide for Individual Investors for full fee and commission schedules. 3 According to Morningstar’s 2019 U.S. Fund Fee Study, some asset managers now charge \"next to nothing” for core index funds, and some index funds charge zero fees.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, Are your finances suffering from neglect? Many of our money habits can seem pretty insignificant on a day-to-day basis, but when you add them up, they can make a big difference. With the holidays behind us, the new year can be the ideal time to give your money a fresh look—and a fresh start. Budget Busters Eliminate even some of these budget busters, and your bank account will thank you. Carrying a credit card balance. Not paying your credit card in full every month is one of the biggest ways to waste money. On average, credit card companies currently charge an annual interest rate of about 16%—and that's if you have good credit; with poor credit, you can pay considerably more. As an example, if you only pay the minimum each month on a $1,000 balance, you'll end up paying about $560 in interest over the course of seven years. Add in a late fee, and you’re even more in the hole. Not researching car financing. After you've spent countless hours researching a new car, it can feel overwhelming to dig into the details of how to finance it. But take your time with this important step. With contracts sometimes stretching out six or more years, you can end up paying a massive amount over time—and easily get stuck owing more than the car is worth. The dealer may not be offering the best terms, so know your options before you step onto a lot. Not paying attention to investment fees. As an investor it's natural to focus on the performance of each individual security, overlooking the impact of fees. But saving 1%, or even 0.5%, can make a big difference over time. For example, if you earn a 7% return for 40 years, a $1,000 initial investment will grow to almost $15,000. But if you just pay an extra 1% in fees, this return will be reduced to about $10,000. Paying for too many subscription services. From streaming services to gym memberships to your favorite food-of-the-month club, subscription services can add up fast. According to a recent study most consumers don't even know how much they spend on these items. So if you haven't recently tallied up your monthly total for those things that automatically show up on your doorstep or screen, do that pronto. You may be shocked at what you find and inspired to trim away some of the excess. Going overboard on personal services. I love pampering as much as the next person, but I also know how easily the costs add up. So, take a few minutes to tally up all of these charges—from haircuts to color, to manicures and pedicures, to the occasional massage. And how about personal training at the gym? These are all wonderful services, but you may be able to save a bundle by whittling them down to the ones you care about most—and can afford. Get more from Ask Carrie. Go to Ask Carrie hub Budget Boosters Much like the budget busters, the following boosters aren't difficult or complicated—but they're all powerful ways to improve your bottom line, especially over time. Be a strategic spender. I'm not suggesting you obsess over every penny, but being mindful about your spending can save you a bundle. Think comparison shopping, researching sales, buying last year's model, and sometimes just walking away from an unnecessary purchase. If you enjoy eating out on a regular basis, how about planning lunch instead of dinner? And remember, paying more doesn’t always get you more—a big-name brand might be more show than go. Commit to your savings. Here's an idea: take all of that money you've saved by eliminating your budget busters and direct it to savings. Every month. Automatically. And possibly even more. And you know what? If you do this every single month, the rest of your budget will pretty much take care of itself. Once you've got your savings on track (think emergency fund, retirement savings, and the money you want for other important goals), the rest is yours to spend—without guilt or worry. Be an investor. If you're a dedicated saver, kudos to you—but if your goal is to build long-term wealth, investing is the key. Saving is all about security and making sure your money is readily available whenever you need it. That's important. When you invest, you take on more risk, but you're also giving yourself the opportunity for a greater return. One caveat: if you're new to investing, it's essential to learn the basics—and seek out professional advice when you need it. Start saving for retirement early. Retirement is one of the biggest things you will ever have to save for, so it's essential to take advantage of one of your greatest assets: time! Not only does starting early give you more years of compound growth, but it also helps you ride out the inevitable market declines. Another imperative: always invest enough in your company retirement plan to capture the maximum match. Skipping a match is like turning down part of your paycheck or saying no to a bonus! Use tax-advantaged accounts. From a 401(k) to an IRA or even a health savings account, don't overlook the power of a tax deduction, tax-deferred growth, or a tax-free withdrawal. The rules for each kind of account are a little different, but all can increase your bottom line by reducing your income tax bill. Don't let these great opportunities from Uncle Sam slip away. So there you have it. As we head into 2022, my hope is that these suggestions will inspire you to give your finances a fresh look. With just a bit of care, you’ll be paving the way for a financially healthy and happy new year. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': \"Do you spend more time planning your annual vacation than you do thinking about your personal finances? And when you finally do get around to thinking about your finances, do you usually end up waiting until the last minute? If so, you’re not alone. A lot of people put off financial planning or avoid it altogether. At Schwab, we view personal financial planning as an ongoing, lifelong process—not a one-time event. When you're proactive about your financial planning and break it into small, achievable tasks, it's a lot less daunting—and it can pay huge dividends to you and your loved ones over time. The following personal finance calendar should help you get started. January Resolve to make yourself financially fit in 2022: Manage your debt. Start by paying off all of your high-cost, non-deductible credit cards, and then establish an emergency fund equal to three to six months of expenses, if you haven't already. Create (or update) your cash flow statement (prior year income minus expenses) and statement of personal net worth. Give your portfolio a checkup, and make sure its mix of assets still matches your time horizon and risk tolerance (Schwab clients can log in and use the Portfolio Checkup tool for this). Market changes can cause your portfolio to drift away from its original target asset allocation because as investments gain and lose value, they become a larger or smaller part of your overall portfolio. This may be a good time to rebalance your portfolio back to your chosen asset allocation. If you’re retired and drawing from your portfolio, you can combine your portfolio rebalancing with your cash-flow planning for the next 12 months. Double-check if and how much you can contribute to your workplace retirement plan. If possible, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of any available employer match. Also, if you're at least 50 years old (or will turn 50 this year), consider making additional catch-up contributions if allowed (up to $6,500 in 2022 for 401(k) and 403(b) plans). If you don't pay enough income tax through regular payroll withholding, file your fourth-quarter estimated income tax payment by January 18. (See the IRS Tax Calendar for other federal tax items due throughout the year). Any annual tax forms 1099, 1098, and W-2 should be mailed to you no later than January 31 (February 15 for some 1099s). If your employer has granted you stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) or restricted stock awards that are vesting, you'll need to decide how to handle them. Tax treatment is slightly different for each one, so make sure you understand the impact before exercising options or selling shares. February Check your insurance policies (property and casualty, liability, health, disability, life) to be sure you're not paying too much for the wrong kind of coverage. Certain mutual funds could restate their distribution information after your initial Form 1099 is mailed to you at the end of January. Though not common, when such fixes are necessary, a corrected 1099 is usually mailed sometime in February. Schwab clients can access tax tools and resources on schwab.com. March If you receive an annual bonus from your employer, use it thoughtfully to increase its potential benefit. It's tempting to splurge, but consider using a bonus to pay down debt, contribute to your retirement plan, or build an emergency fund. Check your credit report. You're entitled to a free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. (Note: Free weekly credit reports that are available due to the pandemic ends April 20, 2022.) April File your income tax return by April 15. If you're requesting an automatic six-month extension, you still need to pay any taxes due by April 15. April 15 is also the last day to make a contribution to your IRA or Coverdell Education Savings Account for the prior year. If applicable, first-quarter estimated income tax payments are due by April 15. May Create (or update) an inventory of your home and personal property for insurance or estate planning. Use your phone to record a video of your valuable possessions, and then store the video in a secure, remote location. Review your estate plan. June Perform a mid-year review of your finances to be sure you're on track: Double check your actual year-to-date income and expenses against your cash-flow projections. Are you on track with your retirement contributions and other savings? Run a projection of your income taxes to be sure you're not paying too much or too little income tax (either through withholding or quarterly payments). If applicable, second-quarter estimated income tax payments are due by June 15. July Build or refresh your money skills. Add at least one good book on personal finance or investing to your summer reading list. August Compare what you actually spent on vacation to the amount you projected in your annual cash-flow plan. Start thinking about your holiday budget. As the kids or grandkids get ready for school, think about establishing or contributing to a Coverdell Education Savings Account and/or 529 College Savings Plan on their behalf. September If applicable, third-quarter estimated income tax payments are due by September 15. If you want to establish a SIMPLE IRA this year for your small business, the account must be opened by October 1. October If you have children heading to college next year, keep in mind that the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) window opens on October 1. It's best to complete the FAFSA as early as possible, because states and colleges use it to award their own grants, scholarships, and loans, and that aid is limited. File your income tax return by October 15 if you requested a six-month extension back in April. If you want to establish and fund an individual 401(k) or SEP IRA for 2022, the account must be opened by your tax filing deadline plus any extensions, which is typically October 15 for most small businesses. Run a projection of your current-year income-tax liability to get a head start on your year-end tax planning. As open enrollment season rolls around at work, take the time to review your health insurance coverage and other employer benefits. November Don't charge more for holiday gifts than you can comfortably pay for in full when the January credit card statements come around. Take time to give thanks for another year of financial success. Review your charitable giving program and consider making tax-deductible gifts to charity or to a donor-advised fund account before the end of the year. December If you have investments that have lost value during the year, consider tax-loss harvesting to potentially lower your tax liability and better position your portfolio going forward. If you're 72 or older in 2022, don't forget to take your annual required minimum distribution (RMD) from your IRA or 401(k) by December 31. If you turn 72 on July 1, 2022 or later, you do not need to take an RMD until April 1 next year. Learn more here about when and how to take RMDs. Get your annual Social Security Statement.

       "   'content': 'When investors think about retirement plans, many focus on putting away cash and then investing it wisely to grow their nest egg. But there’s a critical piece of retirement income planning that’s often overlooked: a strategy to withdraw those carefully tended savings. While everyone’s circumstances are unique, general principles apply to any retirement withdrawal strategy. It’s just a matter of drawing up a budget that reflects all your income and spending expectations and devising a suitable distribution strategy. Avoid tapping your more volatile investment assets to cover regular costs when you could be using income from more predictable sources. Using predictable income or cash to cover expenses You may no longer be getting a paycheck, but with proper planning, you can continue earning a steady income after you retire. Good practice is to pay for essential expenses with predictable income, and if possible, fund discretionary expenses with fluctuating income as appropriate for your needs. For example, Social Security, pension payments, annuities,1 interest income, or even cash or short-term bonds kept in reserve are among the stable and predictable sources of income you can use to cover necessities like housing, car loans, food, and utilities. For most retirees, we suggest setting aside two to four years of essential expenses in cash or short-term bonds after accounting for other predictable income sources. Then, fund discretionary expenses (i.e., “nice-to-haves”) with growth assets or less certain or less guaranteed income sources from your portfolio. Stock dividends, distributions from mutual or exchange-traded funds, and proceeds from selling investments are often consistent, but not guaranteed, compared to the predictable income sources cited above. This can make them a better fit for nonessential items, like vacations, charitable donations, or gifts to a grandchild. Another source of retirement “income” may be withdrawals from investments that have increased in value. Stocks or stock mutual funds, for example, provide potential for growth in your portfolio. However, they can be more volatile than predictable or guaranteed income sources. Avoid tapping your more volatile investment assets to cover regular costs. Selling volatile assets when the market is down can be particularly costly. Instead, use a reserve of lower-volatility investments or cash balances to supplement income from more predictable sources of income. Rebalancing your portfolio to generate cash flow Selling investments to generate cash to support spending as part of annual or periodic portfolio rebalancing can provide another opportunity to generate cash flow. Generally speaking, this rebalancing process is especially important for retirees to manage the amount of more volatile investments, such as stocks, in their portfolio. For most retirees, decreasing your risk and exposure to stocks as you age may make sense, depending on your goals and distribution rate. An out-of-balance portfolio can leave you with more risk or less potential for growth. In volatile markets, these risks can be magnified because retirees have less time than younger investors to potentially recover from losses or lackluster returns of a portfolio that’s strayed from a chosen asset allocation. Portfolios drift away from target allocations as certain asset classes rise or fall, leaving them over- or underweight areas of the market. To get your portfolio back on target during periods when stocks rise in value, you can sell from the stock portion of your portfolio to generate the cash you need to supplement other income sources. In fact, in down markets, the rebalancing process may lead you to tap investments that held their value or rose in value. (See “Selling investments in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts” below for more information.) With an eye on the market, the natural process of rebalancing helps you know what to tap and when. However, remember that rebalancing won’t protect you against losses or guarantee that you’ll meet your goals. Selling investments in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts When selling assets, a general guideline is to tap investments in taxable accounts before taking money from tax-deferred or tax-free accounts, such as a traditional or Roth individual retirement account (IRA) or a 401(k). That’s assuming you have enough retirement savings in taxable brokerage accounts and haven’t yet reached age 72 (70½ if you turned 70½ in 2019 or earlier), the age when the IRS requires you to begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from traditional IRA or 401(k) accounts. Tapping your IRA earlier means losing potential opportunities for tax-deferred compound growth. A possible exception is if your IRA balance is very large relative to other savings or if you need the money sooner. In that case, you might want to start taking distributions before you reach age 72. Otherwise, when you start taking RMDs after age 72, you might be bumped up to a higher tax bracket. Withdrawals of pre-tax contributions and income from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are treated as ordinary income—which is typically taxed at a higher rate than long-term capital gains in taxable accounts.2 Talk with your advisor or a tax professional to time your retirement income distributions wisely. Funding your retirement with a strategic distribution plan One mistake many retirees make is relying only on investment income to support retirement spending and not considering all return sources, including a rise in the value of their investments. If you can live on investment income only, great. But don’t do so at the expense of potential for growth in your portfolio or forget that you have four sources in your portfolio you could tap: interest, dividends, capital gains, and stable assets like cash. Keep these points in mind as you structure your retirement portfolio and create your own distribution plan, and be sure to watch for changes in your spending or income to ensure that your expectations are on track. In a prolonged down market, for example, you may want to curb or postpone discretionary spending to avoid drawing down your portfolio too quickly. Creating income during retirement might sound daunting, but it doesn’t have to be. Three steps—starting with a plan, investing in a balanced portfolio, and then distributing income from a variety of sources—can help you simplify the process and lay the groundwork for the kind of retirement you’ve always wanted. 1 Annuity guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims‐paying ability of the issuing insurance company. 2 Withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax, and prior to age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Despite the strong year for stocks in 2021, markets have confidently priced in some negative trends gathering more momentum in 2022 which may help markets, should trends reverse.',\n",
       "   'content': \"History shows us that the biggest risks in a typical year aren’t usually from out of left field (although that sometimes happens, as it did in 2020 with the COVID-19 outbreak). Rather, they are often hiding in plain sight. As goes one of my favorite quotes often attributed to Mark Twain: “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you in trouble, it’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” Risk appears when there is a very high degree of confidence among market participants in a specific outcome that doesn’t pan out. So, by identifying the unexpected, here are our top five global risks for investors in 2022, in no particular order: Shortages turn into gluts Rate hikes slower than expected China goes from cracking down to propping up COVID waves may not resemble those of 2021 Geopolitical surprises In 2020, economies around the world were worse than anyone had forecast. But that wasn’t true in 2021: in most countries, recoveries were surprisingly rapid. That’s a useful reminder that the risk of surprises is not always to the downside. The balance of our unexpected risks may skew to the upside in 2022. Despite the strong year for stocks in 2021, markets have confidently priced in some negative trends gathering more momentum in 2022 that may help the market should these trends reverse. Shortages turn into gluts Supply shortages lifted inflation and slowed production throughout 2021 as strong demand outstripped supply, amplified by supply chain logjams. Although many expect these delays to linger through the next year, history shows us that shortages often rapidly lead to gluts. Should a supply glut emerge in 2022, it may lead to a fall in inflation with excess inventory prompting price cuts and posing risks to industries that have thrived on the shortage-fueled pricing boost. The transition from shortages to gluts can be rapid. The pandemic created a shortage of masks and gloves in the first half of 2020. Top Glove, the world’s biggest maker of disposable gloves, saw its earnings prospects and stock price soar. Analysts’ earnings estimates jumped by 1400% and the stock price rose by over 400%. When demand began to return to normal, earnings forecasts plunged and the stock gave up all of its gains. We also saw this pattern unfold with home exercise equipment, as you can see in the chart below for Peloton Interactive, of one of the largest fitness companies in the world. After strong order growth in 2020 created shortages leading to both surging earnings and stock prices, demand quickly turned around leading to a round trip for both. Home exercise equipment shortages turned around quickly Source: Charles Schwab, Factset data as of 12/19/2021. This year we have seen a boom and bust swing in both coal and natural gas prices, which have both fallen by 38% after surging to 10 year highs in October. After a year of supply shortages, we may be closer to the end of the supply chain problems than the beginning. Since markets tend to look six-to-twelve months ahead, they may soon begin to reflect the possibility that some shortages may have started to ease, and gluts may have started to form by the second half of next year. If key components become more available and finished goods output takes off, it may be welcome news for markets as a key driver of inflation pressure should ease and be accompanied by improving confidence in a slower tightening cycle from central banks. But it could also pose a risk to some industries that have thrived on the pricing boost from shortages. For more on this risk, please read my recent commentary: Will Shortages Lead To Gluts? Rate hikes are slower than expected Surging global inflation has led markets to anticipate three or more rate hikes next year by each of the Bank of England, Bank of Canada, Reserve Bank of Australia, and the U.S. Federal Reserve. Markets even reflect a rate hike by the European Central Bank (ECB). Should inflation pressures ease in 2022 as we expect, so may the expectations for the number of rate hikes and the corresponding tightening of financial conditions. Inflation in the Eurozone surged to 4.9% in November, the highest in its 23-year history. In response, the market is pricing in high likelihood of an ECB rate hike by the end of 2022, which would end a decade long pattern of looser monetary policy. Energy contributed about two-thirds of the rise in Eurozone consumer price inflation in 2021, which may make it the most important factor to watch. We believe European inflation is likely to slide from a record high of around 5% at year-end 2021 to below the ECB's 2% target by the end of 2022. It could even drop to around 0% if energy market futures prices (including those for electricity and natural gas) for year-end 2022 become a reality. Inflation fears may be peaking, along with concerns that central banks may stall the recovery by acting too quickly to raise rates in 2022. China goes from cracking down to propping up China’s economy slowed to a below average pace this year, due in part to regulatory changes. Over the past few quarters, Chinese authorities have been on a mission to restructure some industries including China’s property sector, in line with the idea that housing should be primarily a place to live and not an investment vehicle. China wants to drive private investment into other, globally competitive industries, not domestic housing. Counteracting this economic drag is the implementation of stimulus following December’s Politburo meeting and Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC). The CEWC statement called for coordination of fiscal and monetary policy. These meetings confirmed that President Xi supports measures to ease policy and stabilize the housing sector. The People’s Bank of China cut bank reserve requirements by 50 bps on December 15 and cut the loan prime rate on December 20, the rate on which most new loans are based, as they attempt to put a floor under the growth rate. China policy rates are well above other countries Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 12/19/2021. China’s monetary policy is shifting into easing mode, as the rest of the world shifts to tightening. With more stimulus on tap, the news flow on China may go from a focus on a crackdown on some industries in 2021 to propping up other industries in 2022. COVID waves may not resemble those of 2021 Investors may have grown confident in how to trade the stock market’s leadership rotations this year. Each time waves of new daily global COVID-19 cases receded to 350,000 they reversed and began a two-month climb. These resurgences tended to be accompanied by the outperformance of defensive, lockdown-era leaders, like tech stocks. After the case count peaked, it would fall for two months, accompanied by the outperformance of economically sensitive, reopening beneficiaries, like energy stocks. You can see this recurring pattern in the chart below of global COVID-19 cases and the relative performance of the world’s tech and energy sectors. Leadership rotation pattern breaking down? Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 12/19/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The repeating pattern suggests each wave lasts two months and has been driving investors to rotate consistently among these stocks. Yet, this winter’s omicron wave (and future waves) may pose a risk to investors, since they may not be unfolding in the same way in terms of COVID-9 cases or market leadership. For this most recent cycle, tech stocks have failed to make new relative highs to energy since the news of omicron broke (circled in red). One reason might be that the valuations of the lockdown leaders are now very high relative to reopening beneficiaries, providing less scope for the latest wave of the sector rotation. Geopolitical surprises Geopolitical risk a regular part of investing. After the globe weathered the COVID crisis without conflict in 2021, the risks of conflict may be higher than expected by the markets in 2022. Hunger may drive social unrest- Food prices are near record highs, according to the United Nation's FAO Food Price Index, which tracks the monthly change in international prices for a basket of cereals, dairy, meat, sugars, and oil/fats. Past spikes in the price of food to current levels have helped to trigger periods of social unrest, like the Arab Spring in 2011. Popular uprisings are rarely localized events, often bringing in developed world powers in response to government collapse and risking broader instability. Food prices in instability danger zone Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 12/19/2021. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) World Food Price Index is a measure of the monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities. It consists of the average of five commodity group price indices weighted by the average export shares of each of the groups over the 2014-2016 period. New leaders in Europe- Italy and France will see elections in early 2022, with the potential for euro-skeptics gaining power in these key economies. Any shift in appetites for the Euro could deprive the ECB of the political support needed to close any widening spreads in the European bond markets. Brexit flare up- Tensions over negotiations between the United Kingdom and European Union over the Northern Ireland Protocol (NIP), a compromise intended to keep an open land border and closed customs union, are escalating as 2022 gets underway. The EU said it was working on punitive trade measures if the U.K. suspended the NIP, potentially. Military conflict- A military conflict between China and Taiwan, from a blockade to an invasion, could draw in other world powers. An invasion of Ukraine by Russia could prompt world powers to impose new sanctions which may elevate energy cost inflation. Iran’s frustration over the lack of progress on lifting sanctions imposed over its nuclear program may even stir up regional conflict in the Middle East The runner-up risk: stagflation With so much speculation about stagflation, the stock market unfriendly combination of slow economic growth and high inflation, it’s hard to say it’s a risk being ignored by market participants. Yet, with valuations above average in many countries, markets aren’t priced for even a small risk of stagflation. In particular, a more contagious and deadly variant could act as a major economic drag and worsen the world’s supply problems, keeping workers out of labor markets and exacerbating logistics snarl-ups. The combined impact of these effects could result in a stagflation shock; leaving central banks with no good options for monetary stimulus and pushing markets into a downfall. Be prepared Whether or not these particular risks come to pass, a new year almost always brings surprises of one form or another. Having a well-balanced, diversified portfolio, whose risk profile is consistent with your goals, and being prepared with a plan in the event of an unexpected outcome are keys to successful investing.

       "   'abstract': 'The end of the year is a great time for a portfolio review—and to evaluate your overall approach to saving and investing. Consider these five tax-smart steps now.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Now is a good time to review your investment portfolio and your overall financial plans to ensure you’re saving as much as you can and working to reduce your tax bill. If you wait until after the holidays to reassess your finances, you could miss out on opportunities that disappear at year end. Here are five end-of-year tax-smart portfolio tips to consider implementing right now: 1. Maximize your retirement savings A tax tip you may already know: Contributions to tax-deferred retirement accounts—such as a 401(k)—reduce your taxable income and provide tax-deferred growth until retirement.1 The end of the year is a good time to re-evaluate your overall savings, do a portfolio checkup, and determine if you can bump up what you’re putting away for retirement. You can also make lump-sum contributions from an annual bonus to give your savings a boost. And remember, if your employer offers matching contributions, don’t leave free money on the table. It’s a good idea to contribute enough to meet your employer’s full match and take advantage of those additional funds. If you’re currently in a lower tax bracket, and you’re likely to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire (a lot of younger people fall into this category), you could benefit from making contributions to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Though contributions to Roth accounts are made with after-tax dollars, that money can grow tax-free. And when you retire, you won’t have to pay taxes on the withdrawals.2 If you are self-employed or own a business, you can contribute to a tax-deferred retirement account, such as a SEP-IRA, a SIMPLE IRA, or an individual 401(k). These contributions will lower your taxable income and could help you stay under the phase-out limitations for the 20% deduction on pass-through income.3 2. Consider a Health Savings Account (HSA) If your employer offers an HSA—and you qualify to contribute to one—this can be a smart way to set aside money for qualified medical expenses.4 HSAs offer a triple tax advantage: You pay no federal taxes on your contributions, no federal taxes on investment earnings, and no taxes on withdrawals as long as the money is used for qualified medical expenses.5 If you are fortunate enough not to have many medical expenses, are 65 or over, and have money left over in your HSA during retirement, you can use that money to pay for living expenses—the only caveat being you’ll have to pay taxes on the withdrawals when they’re not for qualified medical expenses. 3. Give to a favorite charity As with other aspects of your finances, it’s important for charitable giving to be part of a broader financial plan, and it’s worth looking into when doing a year-end portfolio review. One way to take full advantage of the tax benefits of charitable giving is to concentrate your giving into a high-tax year—maximizing your itemized deductions in that year and taking the standard deduction the next.6 Giving appreciated investments (like stocks) in this manner is a great way to maximize your charitable giving deduction, and a donor-advised fund (DAF) could be used to facilitate that gift. DAFs allow you to make a contribution of cash or appreciated investments held for more than one year, receive a current-year tax deduction, and avoid paying capital gains tax on the sale of assets contributed. If you’re age 70½ or older, you could also donate up to $100,000 directly to a charity from your IRA using a qualified charitable distribution (QCD). A QCD allows you to take money directly from your IRA and give it to a qualified charity without having to recognize that withdrawal as income on your tax return. In addition, if you’re subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs), a QCD can be used to cover all or a portion of your annual RMD. 4. Gift assets to your loved ones Each year, you’re allowed to give up to $15,000 to any number of people without having to pay a gift tax. Using this gifting strategy can allow you to transfer a large amount of wealth to your loved ones tax-free and without eating into your gift and estate tax exemption. Those gifts can be used for any number of financial goals, including funding a grandchild’s 529 college savings plan or helping a loved one make a down payment on a new house. 5. Rebalance your portfolio in a tax-smart way The end of the year is also a good time to take a look at your portfolio and make sure it’s aligned to your goals and risk tolerance. Over time, assets that have gained in value will account for more of your portfolio, while those that have declined will account for less. This can leave you exposed to unintended risk if the market environment should suddenly change. That’s where rebalancing your portfolio comes in—and it can be an especially important task for people nearing or in retirement who might be more sensitive to market volatility. Rebalancing involves selling positions that have exceeded your target allocation and moving the proceeds to positions that have become underrepresented. Each time you sell a position, a taxable event occurs. With a bit of planning, you can help reduce the tax impact of rebalancing by using a strategy called tax-loss harvesting. Investors have a tendency to avoid selling anything at a loss, but there can be a significant tax benefit to selling a losing position if you have capital gains to offset. Those losses can be used to reduce your capital gains all the way to zero, and if you have more losses than gains, you can offset up to $3,000 of your ordinary income each year. Tax-loss harvesting can also serve as a motivation to sell underperforming investments or to re-diversify overly concentrated stock positions. The bottom line As you’re taking stock of the year past and looking forward to the year ahead, review your portfolio. You may be able to make some adjustments in order to save more for your goals and pay less on taxes. 1For 2021, the maximum employee 401(k) contribution is $19,500. If you’re age 50 or older, you are allowed to contribute an additional $6,500 in catch-up contributions, for a total of $26,000. 2For Roth accounts, you must be over the age of 59½ and have held the account for five years before withdrawals of income are tax free. 3The 20% deduction (IRC 199A) is available to owners of pass-through entities, such as sole proprietors, partnerships, and S-corporations. There are numerous limitations and rules related to this deduction, so be sure to meet with a tax professional well before year end to go over your specific situation. 4In 2021, the contribution limit for HSAs is $3,600 for self-only health insurance coverage and $7,200 for family coverage. People age 55 or older may contribute an additional $1,000 in either scenario. 5HSA contributions are not deductible in several states, including California and New Jersey. Check with your tax advisor for specific tax advice. State taxes on investment earnings may vary. See IRS Publication 502 for a list of qualified expenses. 6The standard deduction for 2021 is $12,550 for single filers and married couples filing separately, $18,800 for single heads of household, and $25,100 for married couples filing jointly.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"The biggest savings goal you're likely to ever have is retirement. But it's probably not the only one. Life is full of wants and needs, and some of them are expensive. Most people can't write a big check for a wedding, a new home, college tuition, or a business venture without putting money away first. So, what do you do when you need to save for retirement and meet other important milestones along the way? You plan for it. Like navigating with a map, the process of financial planning helps you determine where you'd like to go, even if you have several destinations. You'll have choices when it comes to how you get there and where you stop along the way. Detours may slow you down until you're able to get back on track. As with any journey, a good financial plan starts with your goals, but you can make adjustments as conditions change. Set your priorities When you have multiple goals and a budget that only stretches so far, every goal can't be the most important one. Financial planning starts with identifying your goals and then prioritizing them based on importance, cost, and when you want to reach each one. For most people, retirement is up there at the top and requires the most advanced planning. After all, you could need your nest egg to last 25 to 30 years—or longer. Besides retirement, what matters to you financially might vary depending on your life stage, family needs, and other considerations. When you're starting out, paying off high-interest credit cards or student loans, building an emergency fund, and saving for your first home might come next. Later, long-term wealth and security for your family, including potential for a legacy, could take priority. Planning doesn't come naturally to every investor. A financial planner can help you identify goals, land on a savings amount, create an investment plan for each goal, and put your plan in writing so you can stay focused on what you want to achieve. As new goals enter the picture, a financial plan can guide you toward which ones you can afford given your income, expenses, and time horizon. Then, you can reprioritize if you need to. Find your next step In addition to helping you estimate the costs and timing to reach each goal, a good financial plan generally has personalized action steps, including check-ins with your financial planner. Based on your goals and budget, a financial planner can help you determine what steps to take next and consider different ways of keeping your goals on track. This can be especially helpful when you have competing goals. Take education, for example. Once you have kids, you might feel pressure to cut back on retirement savings to put money away for their college years. But an action step from a planning session could suggest specific ways to reprioritize or augment your budget so you can make progress on both goals. You might find you have more wiggle room than you thought in managing your costs. Or you might be inspired to supplement your income, investigate scholarships, or start saving and investing earlier to give your money more potential opportunity to grow. A good plan will also help you choose strategies, such as use of tax-advantaged accounts, so you can potentially minimize fees and invest tax-efficiently. Adjust as you go Life comes at you fast, and often changes. What's important to you today might not be so important tomorrow. You might face expenses or losses that weren't supposed to be part of the picture. Or you might have an unexpected windfall and be able to reach your goals faster and add new ones. Whatever happens, you can better manage life's inevitable changes with a good financial plan that adjusts along with your goals and priorities—and by getting personalized help when you need it.

       "   'abstract': 'A 529 college savings plan offers many advantages, but it can come with some surprising pitfalls. Here are five mistakes to avoid.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Opening a college savings account is a smart way to invest in the education of a family member, a friend, or even yourself—and it often comes with tax benefits. A popular option is a 529 college savings plan. This investment vehicle was primarily designed to cover higher-education expenses with tax-deferred growth and the potential for tax-free qualified distributions. Almost all states and the District of Columbia offer some type of 529 plan. Although you’re not restricted to your own state’s plan, you should always consider the tax benefits provided by your state before investing in another’s. A 529 plan doesn’t guarantee that you’ll save enough to pay for tuition by the time the first bill comes due. It still requires careful management, such as determining your contribution rate and how to invest your contributions, between the time you set it up and when you begin to pay tuition. (This is also the case for pre-paid tuition 529 plans. While they offer certain guarantees to keep up with the cost of tuition, you still have to save enough to cover other expenses.) You can help improve the benefits you receive from investing in a 529 plan by avoiding these five common mistakes. Mistake #1: Assuming your money will grow A 529 plan might be called a college savings account, but don’t let the word “savings” fool you. Like a 401(k), your money isn’t guaranteed to grow, and your plan’s performance depends on your investment selection, as well as market conditions. It’s important to note that your investments can fluctuate, and you can lose money in a 529 plan. Your purchasing power can also decrease due to inflation, which means your investments may not keep up with the cost of college. You can help mitigate these risks by starting a 529 plan early so that you have more time to potentially recover from market losses, choosing a diversified portfolio of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, and taking advantage of potential compounding growth over time. Mistake #2: Forgetting to adjust your asset allocation and savings rate When you shop for a 529 plan, you typically have the option of choosing an age-based or a static portfolio allocation. An age-based portfolio initially holds more stocks than bonds when the child is younger and then becomes more conservative the closer the child gets to college age (similar to a target-date fund). A static portfolio allocation sticks to the mix of assets you pick. If you go with this option, bear in mind that you’re responsible for periodic rebalancing and for adjusting the asset allocation over time. As with many investment goals, the standard advice here is to reduce your allocation to stocks as college enrollment approaches. Setting up automatic 529 contributions is a great way to get things rolling without having to think about it, but it can also make you complacent about your savings goal. It’s not a bad idea to increase your annual contribution as your earnings grow, particularly if you’re starting off with a modest amount. Many parents supplement regular deposits with periodic contributions from birthday or other holiday gifts from friends and family.1 Mistake #3: Missing your contribution deadline For most states, contributions to 529 plans must be made by December 31 to have them count toward the current year for gift tax purposes. This differs from tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts like IRAs, where you typically have until mid-April of the following year to contribute for income tax purposes. However, if your 529 plan offers a state income-tax deduction, the April deadline might apply. Mistake #4: Withdrawing funds too late or for unqualified expenses Once your child has begun college, and the bills start rolling in, make sure to take out only the money you’ll use for qualified college expenses within that calendar year. This is particularly important for tuition bills that arrive in December and aren’t payable until January. In other words, withdraw the funds and pay the full tuition bill before the end of the year–don’t wait until January. Otherwise, this distribution may be seen as unqualified. Also, make sure the expenses you intend to claim are on the IRS-approved list of qualified expenses for 529 plans and aren’t already covered by other tax-advantaged sources or scholarships. Mistake #5: Emptying an account when your child doesn’t need the money Speaking of scholarships, what if your child ends up with a full or partial free ride to college? In that case, you can withdraw the exact amount of the scholarship, and the usual 10% penalty on nonqualified distributions of earnings would be waived. Ordinary income taxes will still apply, however. The remaining funds can be used for qualified expenses not covered by the scholarship. If some of your child’s college expenses don’t qualify, you don’t have to resign yourself to paying taxes and penalties. For example, if your child intends to pursue an advanced degree, you could leave the money in the plan where it will continue to have tax-deferred growth potential until you pay for graduate school. Another option is to change the beneficiary. You could name your other children as beneficiaries of the funds without paying any penalty or tax. Just be sure to make the switch before the next child begins college. You can also wait and designate the funds for your grandchildren. A 529 plan isn’t just for children. You can appoint yourself the beneficiary and apply the funds to your own continuing education courses. Also, siblings, parents, grandparents, or other eligible family members can be named a beneficiary as long as the funds are used for educational purposes. Creating a savings strategy In addition to the tips above, you can avoid costly missteps with thoughtful planning. Do your research to find the appropriate college savings plan for your family. Then, work with a financial planner or tax advisor to find ways to make tax-smart savings and investing decisions.

It’s also possible to contribute a lump sum of up to $75,000 to one or more 529 college savings plans in a single year ($150,000 for couples) without being subject to the gift tax. The IRS views the money as an annual $15,000 (or $30,000 for couples) gift over five years. However, if you contribute more money on behalf of the same child during those five years, you may trigger the gift tax. States can also put a cap on how much can accumulate in a 529 account. Most states set the limit in the $300,000–$400,000 per beneficiary range, though some states have higher limits.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'If you’re someone who likes to make resolutions on New Year’s Day, you already know how hard it is to stick to them. Here are five resolutions that can help increase your financial fitness and hopefully inspire you to stay committed to them in the new year. An added bonus is that the steps below are also steps we suggest that all investors take as part of creating a financial plan, the foundation, we feel, for any investor looking to own, plan for, and then take the steps needed to save, invest, and reach their financial goals. Resolution 1: Create a budget Saving and investing during your working years, if you stick with it, should lead to a rising net worth over time, enabling you to achieve many of life’s most important goals. Creating your own budget and net worth statement can help you build your road map and stay on track. Here are steps that can help: Pay yourself first. At a minimum, be sure to have a high-level budget with three things: how much you’re taking in after taxes, how much you’re spending, and how much you’re saving. If you’re not sure where your money is going, track your spending using a spreadsheet or an online budgeting tool for 30 days. Determine how much money you need to cover your fixed monthly expenses, such as your rent or mortgage and other living expenses, and how much you’d like to put away for other goals. For retirement, our rule of thumb is to save 10–15% of pre-tax income, including any match from an employer, starting in your 20s. If you delay, the amount you may need to save goes up. Add 10% for every decade you delay saving for retirement. Once you commit to an amount, consider ways you can save automatically. Research shows that saving is easier when you “pay yourself first.” Calculate your personal net worth annually. It doesn’t have to be complicated. Make a list of your assets (what you own) and subtract your liabilities (what you owe). Subtract the liabilities from the assets to determine your net worth. Don’t panic if your net worth declines during tough market periods. What’s important is to see a general upward trend over your earning years. If you’re retired, you’ll want to plan an income and distribution strategy to help make your net worth last as long as necessary and to support other objectives. Project the cost of essential big-ticket items. If you have a big expense in the near term, like college tuition or roof repair, put the money aside or increase your savings and treat that money as spent. If you know that you’ll need the money within a few years, keep it in relatively liquid, safe investments like short-term certificates of deposit (CDs), a savings account, or money market funds purchased within a brokerage account. If you choose to invest in a CD, make sure the term ends by the time you need the cash. If you have more than a few years, invest wisely, based on your time horizon. Retired? Invest your living-expense money conservatively. Consider keeping 12 months of living expenses after accounting for non-portfolio income sources (Social Security or a pension) in short-term CDs, an interest-bearing savings account, or a money market fund. Then consider keeping another two to four years’ worth of spending laddered in short-term bonds or invested in short-term bond funds as part of your portfolio’s fixed income allocation. This helps provide the money you need in the short-term. It also allows you to invest other money for a level of growth potential that makes sense for you, while reducing the chances you’ll be forced to sell more volatile investments (like stocks) in a down market. Prepare for emergencies. If you aren’t retired, we suggest creating an emergency fund with three to six months’ worth of essential living expenses, set aside in a savings account. The emergency fund can help you cover unexpected but necessary expenses without having to sell more volatile investments. Resolution 2: Manage your debt Debt, depending on how you use it, is neither inherently good nor bad—it’s simply a tool. For most people, some level of debt is a practical necessity, especially to purchase an expensive long-term asset to pay back over time, such as a home. However, problems arise when debt becomes more of a burden than a tool. Here’s how to stay in control. Keep your total debt load manageable. Don’t confuse what you can borrow with what you should borrow. Keep the monthly costs of owning a home (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) below 28% of your pre-tax income, and your total monthly debt payments (including credit cards, auto loans, and mortgage payments) below 36% of your pre-tax income. Eliminate high-cost, non-deductible consumer debt. Try to pay off credit-card debt and avoid borrowing to buy depreciating assets, such as cars. The cost of consumer debt adds up quickly if you carry a balance. Consider consolidating your debt in a low-rate home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC), set a realistic budget, and implement a schedule to pay it back. Match repayment terms to your time horizons. If you’re likely to move within five to seven years, you could consider a shorter-maturity loan or an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), depending on current mortgage rates and options. Don’t consider this if you think you may live in your home for longer, or may not be able to manage mortgage payment resets if interest rates or your plans change. We also don’t suggest that you borrow money under the assumption that your home will automatically increase in value. Historically, long-term home appreciation has significantly lagged the total return of a diversified stock portfolio. And, for any type of debt, have a disciplined payback schedule. Create a plan to pay off the mortgage on your primary home before you plan to retire. Resolution 3: Optimize your portfolio We all share the goal of getting better investment results. But research shows timing of markets is difficult and can be counter-productive. So create a plan that will help you stay disciplined in all kinds of markets. Follow your plan and adjust it as needed. Here are ideas to help you stay focused on your goals. Focus first and foremost on your overall investment mix. After committing to a savings plan, how you invest is your next most important decision. Have a targeted asset allocation—that is, the overall mix of stocks, bonds, and cash in your portfolio—that you’re comfortable with, even in a down market. Make sure it’s still in sync with your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and time frame. The longer your time horizon, the more time you’ll have to potentially benefit from up or down markets. Diversify across and within asset classes. Diversification can help reduce risk and can be a critical factor in helping you reach your goals. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are great ways to own a diversified basket of securities in just about any asset class. Consider taxes. Place relatively tax-efficient investments, like ETFs and municipal bonds, in taxable accounts, and relatively tax-inefficient investments, like mutual funds and real estate investment trusts (REITs), in tax-advantaged accounts. Tax-advantaged accounts include retirement accounts, such as a traditional or Roth individual retirement account (IRA). If you trade frequently, do so in tax-advantaged accounts to help reduce your tax bill. Monitor and rebalance your portfolio as needed. Evaluate your portfolio’s performance at least twice a year using the right benchmarks. Remember, the long-term progress that you make toward your goals is more important than short-term portfolio performance. As you approach a savings goal, such as the beginning of a child’s education or retirement, begin to reduce investment risk, if appropriate, so you don’t have to sell more volatile investments, such as stocks, when you need them. Choose appropriate benchmarks. Last, your benchmark to measure investment performance should match your portfolio and your goals. Don’t be tempted to compare your portfolio to what performed best in the market last year or even a portfolio invested 100% in stocks. You should have a portfolio selected to best meet your goals, with an appropriate balance of potential return and risk as well. Progress toward your goals is more important than picking the top-performing stocks each year—which, for any investor, isn’t possible to predict. Resolution 4: Prepare for the unexpected Risk is a part of life, particularly in investments and finance. Your financial life can be upended by all kinds of surprises—an illness, job loss, disability, death, natural disasters, or lawsuits. If you don’t have enough assets to self-insure against major risks, make a resolution to get your insurance needs covered. Insurance helps protect against unforeseen events that don’t happen often, but are expensive to manage yourself when they do. The following guidelines can help you prepare for life’s unexpected moments. Protect against large medical expenses with health insurance. Select a health insurance policy that matches your needs in areas such as coverage, deductibles, co-payments, and choice of medical providers. If you’re in good health and don’t visit the doctor often, consider a high-deductible policy to insure against the possibility of a serious illness or unexpected health-care event. Purchase life insurance if you have dependents or other obligations. First, take advantage of a group term insurance policy, if offered by your employer. These don’t generally require a medical check, and can be cost-effective to provide income replacement for dependents. If you have minor children or large liabilities that will continue after your death for which you can’t self-insure, you may need additional life insurance. Unless you have a permanent life insurance need or special circumstances, consider starting with a low-cost term life policy before a whole life policy. Protect your earning power with long-term disability insurance. The odds of becoming disabled are greater than the odds of dying young. According to the Social Security Administration, a 20-year-old American has a 19% chance of becoming disabled before normal retirement age, and a 3% chance of dying before retirement age.¹ If you can’t get adequate short- and long-term coverage through work, consider an individual policy. Protect your physical assets with property-casualty insurance. Check your homeowner’s or renter’s and auto insurance policies to make sure your coverage and deductibles are still right for you. Obtain additional liability coverage, if needed. A personal liability “umbrella” policy is a cost-effective way to increase your liability coverage by $1 million or more, in case you’re at fault in an accident or someone is injured on your property. Umbrella policies don’t cover business-related liabilities, so make sure your business is also properly insured, especially if you’re in a profession with unique risks and aren’t covered by an employer. Consider the pros and cons of long-term-care insurance. If you consider a long-term-care policy, look for a policy that provides the right type of care and is guaranteed renewable with locked-in premium rates. Long-term care typically is most cost-effective starting at about age 50, and generally becomes more expensive or difficult to find after age 70. You can get independent sources of information from your state insurance commissioner. A sound retirement savings strategy is another way to plan ahead for long-term-care costs. Create a disaster plan for your safety and peace of mind. Review your homeowner’s or renter’s policy to see what’s covered and what’s not. Talk to your agent about flood or earthquake insurance if either is a concern for your area. Generally, neither is included in most homeowner’s policies. Keep an updated video inventory of valuable household items and possessions along with any professional appraisals and estimates of replacement values in a safe place away from your home. Consider storing inventories and important documents on a portable hard drive. It’s also a good idea to have copies of birth certificates, passports, wills, trust documents, records of home improvements, and insurance policies in a small, secure evacuation box (the fireproof, waterproof kind you can lock is best) that you can grab in a hurry in case you have to evacuate immediately. Make sure your trusted loved ones know about this file as well, in case they need it. Resolution 5: Protect your estate An estate plan may seem like something only for the wealthy. But there are simple steps everyone should take. Without proper beneficiary designations, a will, and other basic steps, the fate of your assets or minor children may be decided by attorneys and tax agencies. Taxes and attorneys’ fees can eat away at these assets, and delay the distribution of assets just when your heirs need them most. Here’s how to protect your estate—and your loved ones. Review your beneficiaries, especially for retirement accounts, annuities, and life insurance. The beneficiary designation is your first line of defense, to make your wishes for assets known, and ensure that they transfer to who you want quickly. Keep information on beneficiaries up-to-date to ensure the proceeds of life insurance policies and retirement accounts are consistent with your wishes, your will, and other documents. Update or prepare your will. A will isn’t just about transferring assets. It can provide for your dependents’ support and care, and help you avoid the costs and delays associated with dying without one. It can also spell out plans to repay debts, such as a credit card or mortgage. Keep in mind that a beneficiary designation or asset titling trumps what’s written in a will, so make sure all documents are consistent and reflect your desires. When writing a will, we recommend working with an experienced lawyer or estate planning attorney. Coordinate asset titling with the rest of your estate plan. The titling of your property and non-retirement accounts can affect the ultimate disposition and taxation of your assets. Talk with an estate attorney or lawyer about debts and the titling of assets, such as a home, that don’t have a beneficiary designation, to make sure they reflect your wishes and are consistent with titling laws that can vary by state. Have in place durable powers of attorney for health care. In these documents, appoint trusted and competent confidants to make decisions on your behalf if you become incapacitated. Consider a revocable living trust. This is especially important if your estate is large and complex, and you want to spell out how your assets should be used in detail, or if you have dependent children and want to spell in detail how assets should be managed to support them, who will manage the assets, and other issues. A living trust may not be needed for smaller estates where beneficiaries, titling, and a will can be sufficient, but talk with a qualified financial planner or attorney to be sure. Take care of important estate documents. Make sure a trusted and competent family member or close friend knows the location of your important estate documents. Finally, remember you don’t have to do everything at once. There’s a lot you can do to improve your financial health by taking one step at a time and think of these resolutions as a checklist. Make some real progress on your journey this year. 1Johanna Maleh and Tiffany Bosley. “Disability and Death Probability Tables for Insured Workers Born in 1999.” Social Security Administration, August 2019.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Even after decades of saving, most retirees find that their home is still their single biggest asset, according to a recent report from the Wharton Pension Research Council. And yet the question of what to do with a primary residence in retirement is often presented as binary: Stay put—or sell? If you decide to stay in your home, it\\'s generally wise to pay off a mortgage before you retire, which will help establish a strong financial footing later in life. \"That gives you a lot more financial freedom,\" says Chris Kawashima, CFP®, a senior research analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But staying put doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t leverage your home\\'s value in retirement. After paying off your mortgage or building up equity in your home, you may wish to consider renting it out or tapping its equity to support retirement, especially in a hot housing market. Though such moves can make sense, each carries its own risks. \"You may be tempted to treat your home as a bank to support your retirement, but like everything else in life, it pays to plan ahead and weigh all your options,\" says Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Here are the three most common ways to tap a home\\'s value in retirement. 1. Sell Many retirees choose to relocate or downsize due to climate, cost of living, or for family or health reasons. \"Despite the emotional attachment to the family home, more and more retirees may be thinking, We don\\'t want to take care of this house anymore and may no longer need the space—never mind the expenses beyond a mortgage, such as maintenance and property taxes,\" Rob says. This is especially true of those on a fixed income in high-tax states like California and New York, who were especially hard-hit when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 capped the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) at $10,000 per year. Before you put your house on the market, however, it\\'s important to understand the potential capital gains tax liabilities. Sellers can exclude the first $250,000 in profit ($500,000 for married couples filing jointly), provided they\\'ve owned the house for at least two years and used it as a primary residence for at least two of the past five years. You can calculate capital gains from a home sale by subtracting your cost basis from the selling price. The cost basis includes not only the price you paid for the house but also certain closing costs and settlement fees, along with the cost of any major capital improvements (as opposed to simple repairs), such as additions, a new roof, and even landscaping. It can also include home insurance reimbursements you received for casualty losses, as well as real estate taxes or other costs you paid on behalf of the seller when you first bought your home. IRS Publication 523 outlines which costs and improvements can and cannot be factored into the cost basis. \"Keeping good records, including receipts, is important if you want to take advantage of the kinds of improvements that can increase your cost basis and hence lower your tax bill,\" Rob says. See more Onward articles. Go to Onward hub 2. Rent If you don\\'t plan to live in your house, renting it out can provide another source of income while preserving the option of returning to it or eventually passing it along to your heirs. A rental property can provide not only income but also potential tax benefits. For example, you may be able to deduct certain expenses, such as depreciation and repairs, from your annual rental income. Keep in mind, however, that you\\'ll likely face a host of tax obligations as well—and that any taxable rental income could potentially push you into a higher tax bracket. \"You\\'ll also want to ask yourself, Do I really want to be a landlord? Am I OK with maintaining a rental property and managing a tenant?\" Chris says. \"Finding a good property manager can help, although it can also eat into your rental income—typically around 10% of the monthly rent.\" Also, be sure to check with a real estate agent or your homeowners association regarding local rental laws, which can vary by municipality and even by neighborhood. Owners should also consider setting aside 1% to 2% of the home\\'s value to avoid having to sell securities in a down market to pay for any unexpected expenses. Finally, Chris urges those planning to rent out a second home to treat it as a separate business entity. \"Registering your rental property as a limited liability company (LLC), for example, can help protect your other assets in the event you\\'re sued—as can liability insurance,\" he says. 3. Tap your equity Though you can borrow against the value of your home using either a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity conversion mortgage (HECM), they serve very different purposes. A HELOC allows you to borrow against the equity in your existing residence—and the interest (on up to $750,000 in total mortgage debt1) may be deductible if the funds are used to purchase, build, or substantially renovate a primary or secondary residence. \"If your goal is to repair or enhance the value of your home before a sale, then a HELOC can be a good option,\" Chris says. \"However, I\\'ve seen people use HELOCs to fund ongoing expenses, and that can be a concern. Generally speaking, you\\'re better off living within your means and not using a line of credit to support vacations or other nonessential expenses that don\\'t improve your home.\" Learn about tapping into your home\\'s equity with a HELOC from Schwab Bank. An HECM, which is a type of reverse mortgage, uses the home\\'s equity to offer those 62 and older a fixed monthly payment, a lump sum, or a line of credit that, unlike a standard mortgage, doesn\\'t require regular loan repayments. Instead, accrued interest is added to the balance and the loan doesn\\'t have to be paid off until you move, sell, or pass away. A reverse mortgage can allow you to hold on to your home while tapping some of its value for interim expenses. Additionally, if you use a Federal Housing Administration (FHA)–insured reverse mortgage, neither you nor your heirs will have to pay back more than the home is worth. On the other hand, it means putting some of your home equity toward the loan\\'s fees and interest payments. Reverse mortgages can provide flexibility to retirement income strategies. \"For example, if you want to avoid tapping your portfolio during a down market or you require emergency cash beyond what you have on hand, a reverse mortgage could be a good fit,\" Chris says. \"What\\'s most important is to be strategic with its use. There\\'s always a cost to borrowing, and reverse mortgages are no different.\" The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recommends you talk first with a federally approved housing counselor who specializes in reverse mortgages to fully understand both your options and the terms of any loan you do undertake. A financial planner can also help you think through the best way to tap your home\\'s equity for your needs. House and home If you\\'re a retiree with substantial equity in your home, you may be tempted to sell in order to augment your savings, particularly if you\\'re lucky enough to live in a desirable real estate market. But don\\'t lose sight of the fact that your house is also a home with an emotional value. \"Even those who\\'ve run the numbers and are selling for all the right reasons can find the decision to leave an emotional one,\" Rob says. \"That\\'s one reason it\\'s important to weigh all your options well in advance, so you choose the decision that not only makes the most financial sense but also is the one with which you\\'re most comfortable.\" 1 Homeowners whose mortgages predate 12/16/2017 can deduct up to $1 million in home acquisition debt.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Revenue bonds account for nearly two-thirds of all investment-grade municipal bonds outstanding, but they tend to get less attention than general obligation bonds. Here’s what investors should know.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Municipal bonds generally can be classified into two camps—general obligation bonds and revenue bonds. General obligation, or GO, bonds are backed by the general revenue of the issuing municipality, while revenue bonds are supported by a specific revenue source, such as income from a toll road, hospital, or higher-education system. We recently focused on general obligation bonds, but here we’ll discuss revenue bonds and what to look for when investing in them. Revenue municipal bonds, or revenue bonds, account for nearly two-thirds of all investment-grade munis outstanding, but they tend to get less attention than their more popular counterpart, general obligation bonds. Credit quality varies with revenue bonds, but they can be an attractive option for muni investors looking to round out a diversified portfolio or to add investments that may have higher yields, if they’re willing to accept additional risks. Broadly, municipal bonds, including both GO and revenue bonds, are sold by local and state governments to help fund public projects or municipal government operations, like building new schools or repairing city sewer systems. Their interest payments are usually exempt from federal income taxes, and may be exempt from state income taxes if the bond issuer is located in the investor’s home state. For these reasons munis are often attractive to income-oriented investors looking to reduce income tax bills. Composition of the municipal bond market Source: Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index, as of 12/01/2020. \"Other revenue bonds” include the industry development revenue (IDR)/pollution control revenue (PCR), housing, and resource recovery indexes. There are many types of revenue bonds A common mistake investors make is to lump all revenue bonds in the same category. Given the size and diversity of the revenue bond market, investors can benefit from identifying the right type of revenue bonds for their needs and focusing a portion of their municipal bond portfolio there. Most revenue bonds are backed by a “net” or “gross” pledge on the enterprise’s revenue. A gross pledge is a stronger pledge, because it is a pledge on revenues before operating or other expenses. A net pledge is a pledge of revenues after the enterprise pays for operating and other expenses. Below we delve deeper and take a look at the different categories of revenue bonds and the different business risks that each may face. Bonds with usually less business risk: 1. Water and sewer/public power electric utilities bonds: Water and sewer revenue bonds are issued to finance the construction and improvement of sanitation or water utility facilities. Revenues to meet debt service are derived from various rates and fees, which most often are based on usage and connections. Public power electric utilities acquire or generate electric power and provide it to their constituents. Some utility districts are publicly owned or operated and issue equity or taxable debt. However, utilities that are owned and/or operated by a municipality or state agency may issue tax-exempt debt. What matters most: Water and sewer revenue bonds are considered to be tied to “essential services” and are viewed as more conservative municipal bonds. Public power electric utilities bonds tend to be more complex, but can also be considered “essential services.” They tend to face more public and regulatory scrutiny because electric generation is one of the largest contributors to CO2 emissions. Debate over the impact of CO2 emissions on the environment and technological advancements are unique issues facing this sector. 2. Special tax revenue bonds: A special tax revenue bond is a bond that is repaid by levying a tax on a particular activity or asset. For example, a special tax may be levied on the sale of alcohol or tobacco to help fund a new cancer research facility. What matters most: The credit quality of these bonds depends on what is being taxed, the social or economic trends that will affect the usage of that activity or asset, and the legal protections regarding comingling of funds with general government funds. For example, if the special tax is levied on the sale of tobacco, then the trend in the usage of tobacco products is a relevant concern. These types of bonds can be very strong or weak depending on coverage and legal protections. Investors should pay special consideration to the credit rating of the sponsoring enterprise, because it could affect the credit rating of the special tax revenue bond. Bonds with usually more business risk: 3. Transportation revenue bonds: Transportation revenue bonds are issued to finance local public transportation projects, such as buses, subway systems, toll roads and airport systems. The bonds may be repaid through the revenue earned by the transportation system. However, some transportation revenue bonds are repaid through taxes generated in the area the system serves or another pledge. What matters most: At the simplest level, the credit quality of a transportation revenue bond depends on the essentiality of the service its issuer provides to the population it serves and the credit pledge. The credit quality of a transportation revenue bond may vary widely, with more-essential systems generally having greater flexibility to raise rates if needed. Transportation revenue bonds backed by a broader pledge, compared to just fare box revenues, also tend to receive higher credit ratings on average. Further spread of COVID-19 may stress the transportation sector to a greater degree than other sectors because the transportation sector tends to rely on large groups of individuals. We would be cautious of transportation issuers that are backed by farebox revenues in areas where there are large case counts. 4. Education revenue bonds: Education revenue bonds are issued to finance the construction or improvement of higher-education facilities, like public and private colleges, or help with ongoing operations. Revenue is partly derived from students’ tuition payments or from the institution itself. What matters most: The characteristics of the university system are a key factor in determining the credit quality of the issuer. The higher-education sector can essentially be split into private and public colleges and universities. Publics tend to be large and benefit from economies of scale and are less dependent on student tuition. For more conservative bonds, look for educational facilities that have a strong reputation and will continue to attract a large student population. We are cautious on lower-rated private institutions due the many questions regarding what the future of higher education will look like in a post-COVID world. 5. Hospital and health care revenue bonds: Hospital bonds are issued to finance the construction or expansion of hospitals or health care facilities. They generate a large share of their revenues through reimbursements for services from either commercial insurers, commercially insured patients, patients insured through public entities such as Medicare and Medicaid, or self-pay from patients lacking insurance. What matters most: Compared to other sectors of the municipal market, hospitals and health care providers tend to have more business risk, and, with the exception of larger, more established systems, tend to be lower-rated. In our opinion, tread cautiously here. Though municipal defaults are historically a rarity, when they do occur, a large portion occur within hospital and health care revenue bonds. In fact, nearly 30% of all munis that are in default are in the hospital and retirement sector.1 Coupled with rising health care costs, political issues facing the health care industry, and COVID related issues, it is very important to fully understand what you are buying with a hospital or health care facility bond. 6. Lease revenue bonds: Lease revenue bonds are a unique structure in the muni market. Instead of issuing long-term debt, like general obligation bonds do, to finance improvements on a public facility, the municipality may enter into an arrangement that uses lease revenue bonds. Often a trust, not the municipality, issues bonds and generates revenues to pay the bonds back by leasing the facility to the municipality. The municipality will generally appropriate money during each budget session to meet the lease payment. Analysis: The unique structure of a lease revenue bond makes the essentiality of the facility being leased and the legal protections on appropriating funds very important. Bonds backed by structures with lower essentiality and limited protections for appropriating funds will usually be lower-rated and have higher yields. Our opinion is to be cautious of bonds backed by lease revenues, as these bonds should be viewed more like general government bonds, not revenue bonds. Yields for revenue bonds vary Given the complexity of the revenue bond market, it may not come as a surprise that yields and spreads vary. A spread is the additional yield a bond pays above a very highly rated benchmark. Bonds with more business risk and that likely face greater risks from COVID-19, like the hospital and transportation sectors, have higher spreads on average. However, sectors with less business risk, like water & sewer, have much lower spreads. Currently, spreads for all sectors are tight relative to their longer-term averages. In our view, given the low level of spreads, we think it’s prudent to be cautious with revenue sectors that tend to exhibit greater risks. Spreads for all sectors are well below their longer-term averages Source: Components of the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index, as of 11/29/2021. Differences in spreads may be due to differences in duration, credit qualities, maturities, coupon structure, or other factors. What to do now Consider allocating up to 100% of your muni bond portfolio in higher-rated bonds—those rated AA-/Aa3 or above. Start with highly rated general obligation and essential-service revenue bonds. More speculative investors looking for higher interest income could consider no more than 30% in lower-rated issuers—those rated BBB-/Baa3 to A+/A1. As one would expect, a lower-rated bond has a much greater chance of default than one with higher ratings.

       "   'abstract': 'Find out why you should have a trade plan—and the five elements that may help you put it to work successfully.',\n",
       "   'content': 'The decision to buy a stock usually comes down to a hunch that you can turn a profit. But markets are unpredictable, and a lot can happen on the journey from inspiration to success, which is why seasoned traders draft trade plans before putting any money on the line. In short, a trade plan means setting parameters for getting into and out of trades, how much money you’re putting at risk, and a profit strategy. Think of it as tool for keeping a cool head as you build and reshape positions when markets are on the move. It starts with a quick self-evaluation: What is the basis of your hunch? Are you looking at fundamental factors focused on company performance, or technical factors based on market trends and patterns in stock charts? Which investing style do you prefer? For example, are you looking for fast-moving growth stocks or underpriced value stocks? Are you trading a trend or a countertrend? What’s your view of market sentiment? Is momentum generally tilted up or down? Once you have your bearings, and you’ve identified a list of stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) suited to your preferred method of research—fundamental, technical, or both—you’re ready to draft a plan. Here are the five key elements to include: Element 1: Your time horizon How long do you plan to hold a stock? This will depend on your trading strategy. Generally, traders fit into one of three categories: Single-session traders are very active and look to gain from small price variations over very short time periods (minutes or hours) throughout the trading day. Swing traders target trades that can be completed in a few days to a few weeks. Position traders seek larger gains and recognize that it often takes longer than a few weeks to achieve them. Element 2: Your entry strategy Look for entry signals—for instance, divergences from trend lines and support levels—to help you place your trades. The signals you employ and the orders you use to make good on them hinge on your trading style and preferences. Here’s an example of one moving outside a support or resistance level with increasing volume, also known as a breakout. Is this stock poised for a breakout? Source: StreetSmart Edge® In the chart above, XYZ has just broken through a resistance level—the price where selling might be strong enough to prevent further price increases. With breakouts, consider limiting trades to stocks that have broken through resistance areas and where trading volume is above average, not just for the trading day but for the specific time of day. A trader looking for an entry point could consider buying XYZ at slightly above the resistance level, in this case that could mean buying at $123. To help manage their risks in the event of a reversal, the trader could also place a stop order at $120. If the stock drops below $120, the stop order would become a market order to sell the stock. However, there’s no guarantee that execution of a stop order will be at or near the stop price, so risk is not entirely eliminated. Here’s another example with a stock that is experiencing a pullback, meaning it has fallen from a recent peak. What we’re looking for here is a possible entry should the stock just be taking a temporary breather before rising again. Has this stock pulled back? Source: StreetSmart Edge® Examples are hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. Start by looking for some area of support—a price level at which demand might be strong enough to prevent further declines—such as the stock pulling back to a moving average or an old low. Some traders even wait until the stock moves above the high of the previous day—a sign that the pullback might be over. In this case, XYZ is still trading above the support level of $30.50, so entering at $31 could make sense. Element 3: Your exit plan When it comes to an exit strategy, plan for two types of trades: those that go in your favor and those that don’t. You might be tempted to let favorable trades run, but don’t ignore opportunities to take some profits. For example, when a trade is going your way, you could consider selling part of your position at your initial target price and letting the rest of your position run. To prepare for when a trade moves against you, you can set a stop order at a price below a support level to help manage your risk if the stock breaks below that level. Element 4: Your position size Trading is risky. A good trade plan establishes ground rules for how much you’re willing to risk on any single trade. Say, for example, you don’t want to risk losing more than 2%–3% of your account on a single trade. You could consider exercising portion control, or sizing positions, to fit your budget. Here’s a scenario: A trader with $150,000 in total capital is interested in a stock trading at $67 a share. The trader could set a maximum budget per trade of 10% of the account, or $15,000. That means the maximum number of shares the trader can buy is 223 ($15,000 ÷ $67). Let’s also imagine the trader doesn’t want to lose more than $3,000 of their $150,000 on this trade. If we divide that amount by 223 shares, that means the trader can tolerate a drop of $13.45 per share ($3,000 ÷ 223). Subtracting that amount from the stock’s current price, gives the trader a target stop price of $53.55 ($67 – $13.45). The trader may never have to use this stop order, but at least it’s in place if the trade moves the wrong way. Element 5: Your trade performance Are you making or losing money with your trades? And, most importantly, do you understand why? Look over your trading history to calculate your theoretical trade expectancy, meaning your average gain (or loss) per trade. You start by determining the percentage of your trades that have been profitable versus those that haven’t. This is known as your win/loss ratio. Next, compute your average gain for profitable trades and average loss for unprofitable trades. Then, you multiply them. That gives you average gain per winning trade and average loss per loser. Subtract the latter from the former to determine your trade expectancy. Here’s an example of how that might look: How profitable are your trades? A positive trade expectancy indicates that, overall, your trading was profitable. If your trade expectancy is negative, it’s probably time to review your exit criteria for trades. The final step is to look at your individual trades and try to identify trends. Technical traders can review moving averages, for example, and see whether some were more profitable than others when used for setting stop orders (e.g., 20-day versus 50-day). Sticking to it Even with a solid trade plan, emotions can knock you off course. This is particularly true when a trade goes your way. Being on the winning side of a single trade is great, but far better is to score a series of them. Understanding what goes into a smart trade plan is the first step to prepare you for your next trade.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I only have a small budget for charitable giving but want to make the most of every dollar. Are there ways I can maximize my donations? —A Reader Dear Reader, There’s always a special focus on giving during the holidays, and this year, the pandemic has created an even greater need to support charities on all levels—local, national, and global. And, like you, many people are looking for ways to get the most bang for their charitable bucks. Fortunately, you don’t have to have a lot of money to make a difference in the lives of others. You just need to be thoughtful and strategic because it’s not only how much you give but the way you give that can increase its effectiveness. Here are five steps that will help you devise a plan to stretch every dollar to its maximum impact. Step 1. Identify your goals There are hundreds of well-deserving causes—homelessness, the environment, refugees, medical research, arts and humanities, and social justice, just to name a few. And, of course, there’s my favorite cause—financial literacy. How can you decide where and how much to give? First, find your focus by thinking about why you want to give. Make it personal. What passions and interests motivate you? How does supporting a particular cause reflect your values? Talk to your family and involve them in the decision. If you have children, including them in your giving strategy can lead to new ideas and be an inspiration for them—and you. Next, narrow down your options to five causes you connect with most. It can help to write a statement about why you want to support each cause and how. This type of values-based giving can make your donation more meaningful and personal, and it can motivate you to continue to find new ways to give. Step 2. Establish your giving structure Next, decide what types of assets you’ll give. It can be cash or goods (like used clothing or furniture), as well as real estate or appreciated securities. Donating appreciated assets held for more than one year—including publicly traded stocks—can be particularly effective, not only helping you save on taxes but also netting more to the charity. The type of asset you give and the type of charity you donate to determines the tax deduction. Certain charities like 501c(3) organizations are eligible for tax-deductible donations, but there are annual limits to charitable deductions. Before making your donation, it can be wise to talk with a financial advisor or tax planner. You can give directly or establish charitable-giving vehicles like a donor-advised fund (DAF), a private foundation, or a trust. You can also give through certain types of accounts, like an IRA, to maximize the amount you give and the tax deduction. Step 3. Create your giving plan Instead of focusing just on the current year, it can be helpful to set a three-year charitable-giving budget. This type of big-picture thinking can ensure that your charitable-giving goals fit in with your overall financial situation and don’t jeopardize your other important goals—like retirement. Next, do some research. With over 1.5 million nonprofits out there, zeroing in on specific organizations can be a challenge. Sites like Candid (formerly GuideStar), Charity Navigator, and Charity Watch can help you find what you’re looking for. Also, get recommendations from friends and experts who are knowledgeable about the causes you want to support. Check with your local community foundation to find nonprofit opportunities close to home. Once you’ve identified the specific organizations you want to support, create a short-list and do a deeper review to make sure there are no red flags before you make a contribution. Step 4. Implement your giving plan Think about your gift’s purpose, how often you want to give, and if there are any specific terms you want to designate. Do you want your gift to be applied to a specific purpose, or do you trust the organization to determine its best use? If your gift is ongoing, will it be monthly or annually? While taxes may play a part in how you time your gifts, some families give at specific times of the year—like Memorial Day, Thanksgiving, or someone’s birthday—to make the gift more meaningful. A DAF can be a good choice for ongoing gifts because you can pre-fund it. Because a DAF is a charity itself, you can donate an amount now (and be eligible for a tax deduction) and make recommendations to gift to multiple charities in the future, often in amounts as little as $50. DAFs also allow you to invest and potentially grow your funds in the meantime. Regardless of how you give, keep track of your gifts (a DAF will do this for you) and periodically review and refine your charitable plan. That way you can adjust your giving tactics and strategy as your life evolves. Step 5. Explore further Whether you’re brand new to philanthropy or a seasoned hand, keep your eyes, ears, and mind open to different ways of giving. This includes asking your employer if they match charitable donations, volunteering, or organizing a fundraiser or event to support a cause. You might serve on the board of a nonprofit or offer your professional services. Be flexible. How, where, and how much you give today may change as you and your passions and interests change. To learn more about creating a comprehensive giving strategy, check out the Schwab Charitable Giving Guide. It will help you zero in on the values and causes that are important to you, craft focus statements, engage your family members, determine your charitable giving budget, and ultimately devise a strategic plan. To me, charitable giving isn’t only an act of generosity but a way we can all enhance our own lives. By giving meaningfully—and strategically—you can derive a deep sense of satisfaction knowing you’re making a difference. Happy giving! Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': 'With the year rapidly coming to a close, it might pay to prepare in advance for Tax Day. “It’s a great time to reassess your tax planning for 2021. An important part of this process is to know the likely tax bracket you’ll be in, the limits that could impact you, and the potential deductions available,” says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, and director of tax planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Here are eight things to keep in mind as you prepare to file your 2021 taxes. 1. Income tax brackets shifted a bit There are still seven tax rates, but the income ranges (tax brackets) for each rate have shifted slightly to account for inflation. For 2021, the following rates and income ranges apply: Taxable income brackets Taxable income brackets Tax rate Single filers Married couples filing jointly (and qualifying widows or widowers) 10% $0 to $9,950 $0 to $19,900 12% $9,951 to $40,525 $19,901 to $81,050 22% $40,526 to $86,375 $81,051 to $172,750 24% $86,376 to $164,925 $172,751 to $329,850 32% $164,926 to $209,425 $329,851 to $418,850 35% $209,426 to $523,600 $418,851 to $628,300 37% $523,601 or more $628,301 or more Source Internal Revenue Service. 2. The standard deduction increased slightly After an inflation adjustment, the 2021 standard deduction increases slightly to $12,550 for single filers and married couples filing separately and $18,800 for single heads of household, who are generally unmarried with one or more dependents. For married couples filing jointly, the standard deduction rises to $25,100. 3. Itemized deductions remain the same For most filers, taking the higher standard deduction is more practical and saves the hassle of keeping track of receipts. But if you have enough tax-deductible expenses, you might benefit from itemizing. The following rules for itemized deductions haven’t changed much for 2021, but they’re still worth pointing out. State and local taxes: The deduction for state and local income taxes, property taxes, and real estate taxes is capped at $10,000. Mortgage interest deduction: The mortgage interest deduction is limited to $750,000 of indebtedness. But people who had $1,000,000 of home mortgage debt before December 16, 2017, will still be able to deduct the interest on that loan. Medical expenses: Only medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI) can be deducted in 2021. Charitable donations: The cash donation limit of 100% of AGI remains in place for 2021, if the donation is to operating charities.1 Miscellaneous deductions: No miscellaneous itemized deductions are allowed. 4. IRA and 401(k) contribution limits remain the same The traditional IRA and Roth contribution limits in 2021 remain the same as in 2020. Individuals can contribute up to $6,000 to an IRA, and those age 50 and older also qualify to make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution. If you’re able to max out your IRA, consider doing so—you may qualify to deduct some or all of your contribution. The 2021 contribution limits for 401(k) accounts also stays at $19,500. If you’re age 50 or older, you qualify to make an additional $6,500 catch-up contribution as well. 5. You can save a bit more in your health savings account (HSA) For 2021, the max you can contribute to an HSA is $3,600 for an individual (up $50 from 2020) and $7,200 for a family (up $100). People age 55 and older can contribute an extra $1,000 catch-up contribution. To be eligible for an HSA, you must be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (which usually has lower premiums as well). Learn more about the benefits of an HSA. 6. The Child Tax Credit has been expanded For 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) temporarily modifies the Child Tax Credit requirements and amounts for household incomes below $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for married filing jointly. First, the ARPA raises the age limit for dependents from 16 to 17. In addition, the child tax credit increases from $2,000 to $3,000 for children age 6 through 17 and up to $3,600 for children under 6. If your income exceeds the above limits but is below $200,000 for single filers or $400,000 for joint filers, you’ll receive the standard child tax credit of $2,000 per child. The IRS began sending monthly advance Child Tax Credit payments to eligible families in July and sent its last advance in December. If your dependent doesn’t qualify for the child tax credit, you may still qualify for up to $500 of tax credits under the “credit for other dependents” (see IRS Publication 972 for more details). Tax credits, which reduce the tax you owe dollar for dollar, are generally better than deductions, which reduce your taxable income. 7. The alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption went up Until the AMT exemption enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expires in 2025, the AMT will continue to affect mostly households with incomes over $500,000. Still, the AMT has investment implications for some high earners. For 2021, the AMT exemptions are $73,600 for single filers and $114,600 for married taxpayers filing jointly. The phase-out thresholds are $1,047,200 for married taxpayers filing a joint return and $523,600 for all other taxpayers. 8. The estate tax exemption is even higher The estate and gift tax exemption, which is indexed to inflation, rises to $11.7 million for 2021. But the now-higher exemption is set to expire at the end of 2025, meaning it could be essentially cut in half at that time if Congress doesn’t act. The annual gift exclusion, which allows you to give money to your loved ones each year without incurring any tax liability or using up any of your lifetime estate and gift tax exemption, stays at $15,000 per recipient. Don’t get caught off guard As you prepare to file your taxes for 2021, here are a few additional items to consider. If you’re not retired, the 10% early withdrawal penalty that was waived for retirement account distributions in 2020 was reinstated for 2021. If you’re age 72 or older, make sure you’ve taken your required minimum distribution (RMD) from your retirement accounts or else you face a 50% penalty on any undistributed funds (unless it’s your first RMD, in which case, you can wait until April 1, 2022). If you haven’t contributed to your retirement accounts already, now is the time. Review your earnings for the year and take advantage of any deductions that can lower your tax bill. Also, keep an eye on Washington for any last-minute tax changes that can affect your return before you file. Tax season will be here before you know it, and it’s never too early to start preparing. 1Operating charities, or qualifying public charities, are defined by Internal Revenue Code section 170(b)(1)(A). You can use the Tax Exempt Organization Search tool on IRS.gov to check an organization’s eligibility.'}],\n",

But people who had $1,000,000 of home mortgage debt before December 16, 2017, will still be able to deduct the interest on that loan. Medical expenses: Only medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI) can be deducted in 2021. Charitable donations: The cash donation limit of 100% of AGI remains in place for 2021, if the donation is to operating charities.1 Miscellaneous deductions: No miscellaneous itemized deductions are allowed. 4. IRA and 401(k) contribution limits remain the same The traditional IRA and Roth contribution limits in 2021 remain the same as in 2020. Individuals can contribute up to $6,000 to an IRA, and those age 50 and older also qualify to make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution. If you’re able to max out your IRA, consider doing so—you may qualify to deduct some or all of your contribution. The 2021 contribution limits for 401(k) accounts also stays at $19,500. If you’re age 50 or older, you qualify to make an additional $6,500 catch-up contribution as well. 5. You can save a bit more in your health savings account (HSA) For 2021, the max you can contribute to an HSA is $3,600 for an individual (up $50 from 2020) and $7,200 for a family (up $100). People age 55 and older can contribute an extra $1,000 catch-up contribution. To be eligible for an HSA, you must be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (which usually has lower premiums as well). Learn more about the benefits of an HSA. 6. The Child Tax Credit has been expanded For 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) temporarily modifies the Child Tax Credit requirements and amounts for household incomes below $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for married filing jointly. First, the ARPA raises the age limit for dependents from 16 to 17. In addition, the child tax credit increases from $2,000 to $3,000 for children age 6 through 17 and up to $3,600 for children under 6. If your income exceeds the above limits but is below $200,000 for single filers or $400,000 for joint filers, you’ll receive the standard child tax credit of $2,000 per child. The IRS began sending monthly advance Child Tax Credit payments to eligible families in July and sent its last advance in December. If your dependent doesn’t qualify for the child tax credit, you may still qualify for up to $500 of tax credits under the “credit for other dependents” (see IRS Publication 972 for more details). Tax credits, which reduce the tax you owe dollar for dollar, are generally better than deductions, which reduce your taxable income. 7. The alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption went up Until the AMT exemption enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expires in 2025, the AMT will continue to affect mostly households with incomes over $500,000. Still, the AMT has investment implications for some high earners. For 2021, the AMT exemptions are $73,600 for single filers and $114,600 for married taxpayers filing jointly. The phase-out thresholds are $1,047,200 for married taxpayers filing a joint return and $523,600 for all other taxpayers. 8. The estate tax exemption is even higher The estate and gift tax exemption, which is indexed to inflation, rises to $11.7 million for 2021. But the now-higher exemption is set to expire at the end of 2025, meaning it could be essentially cut in half at that time if Congress doesn’t act. The annual gift exclusion, which allows you to give money to your loved ones each year without incurring any tax liability or using up any of your lifetime estate and gift tax exemption, stays at $15,000 per recipient. Don’t get caught off guard As you prepare to file your taxes for 2021, here are a few additional items to consider. If you’re not retired, the 10% early withdrawal penalty that was waived for retirement account distributions in 2020 was reinstated for 2021. If you’re age 72 or older, make sure you’ve taken your required minimum distribution (RMD) from your retirement accounts or else you face a 50% penalty on any undistributed funds (unless it’s your first RMD, in which case, you can wait until April 1, 2022). If you haven’t contributed to your retirement accounts already, now is the time. Review your earnings for the year and take advantage of any deductions that can lower your tax bill. Also, keep an eye on Washington for any last-minute tax changes that can affect your return before you file. Tax season will be here before you know it, and it’s never too early to start preparing. 1Operating charities, or qualifying public charities, are defined by Internal Revenue Code section 170(b)(1)(A). You can use the Tax Exempt Organization Search tool on IRS.gov to check an organization’s eligibility.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Stock settlement violations can occur when new trades are not properly covered by settled funds. Here we discuss the main types of settlement violations and how to avoid them. What is settlement? Settlement marks the official transfer of securities to the buyer\\'s account and cash to the seller\\'s account. When does settlement occur? For most stock trades, settlement occurs two business days after the day the order executes, or T+2 (trade date plus two days). For example, if you were to execute an order on Monday, it would typically settle on Wednesday. For some products, such as mutual funds, settlement occurs on a different timeline. What counts as settled funds? Incoming cash (such as a check deposit or wire) The available margin borrowing value in a margin account (doesn\\'t apply to a cash account) Settled sale proceeds of fully paid-for securities How can I view settlement information on Schwab.com? You can view the settlement date for a particular transaction in your account History page, or you can see your account\\'s total available settled funds in your account Balances page. To view History: Log into Schwab.com. Select Accounts. Click History. Click on the Transactions tab. To view the Trade Transactions Details window, click the Trade Details link. (See below.) Source: Schwab.com To view Balances: Log into Schwab.com. From the Accounts dropdown, select Balances. Navigate to the right-hand side of the page to Funds Available. Under To Trade, you\\'ll see the Settled Funds total. (See below.) Source: Schwab.com What are settlement violations? Stock settlement violations occur when new trades to buy are not properly covered by settled funds. Although settlement violations generally occur in cash accounts, they can also occur in margin accounts, particularly when trading non-marginable securities. The main types of violation are good faith, freeriding, and liquidation. Good faith violations occur when you buy a stock with unsettled funds, and then sell it before the funds you bought it with have settled. The situation: Ms. Jones sells 100 shares of XYZ stock for $2,000, the proceeds from which will settle two business days later (T+2). Ms. Jones immediately invests $1,000 of the unsettled proceeds in UVW stock. The next day, Ms. Jones sells her UVW stock for $1,500—a day before the XYZ trade settles. The violation: Ms. Jones bought UVW stock using unsettled proceeds from her sale of XYZ stock, and then sold the UVW stock before the XYZ proceeds settled on T+2. The consequence: The first instance of a good-faith violation in an account generally leads to a notification, but no restrictions. (Note that Schwab may at its discretion impose permanent restrictions or account closures.) The second through fourth violations in a rolling 12-month period can lead to a 90-day settled-cash restriction, meaning trading is limited to the amount of settled funds available in your account. At Schwab, clients can use a one-time exception—i.e., once in the life of the account—to remove such a restriction. The fifth violation of any kind generally results in a permanent settled-cash restriction. Freeriding violations occur when you buy a security in a cash account that lacks sufficient settled funds and then sell the same security before depositing funds to pay for its purchase. This violation can occur whether the purchase and sale occur on the same day or on different days. The situation: Mr. Smith starts the day with $100 of settled cash in his account, and buys $1,000 of XYZ stock. The remaining $900 needed to cover the trade is due by the settlement date on T+2. The next day, Mr. Smith still hasn\\'t deposited the outstanding $900 he owes, but sells his XYZ shares for $1,500. The violation: Mr. Smith sold stock before paying for its purchase. The consequence: Industry regulations require the brokerage firm to freeze the account for 90 days, during which time trading is restricted to the amount of settled funds available. (At its discretion, Schwab may impose permanent restrictions or account closures.) Schwab cannot waive this restriction. However, if funds are deposited within the payment period to cover the entire purchase—generally four business days after the trade date—the violation may be downgraded to a good faith violation. Liquidation violations are based on trade dates rather than settlement dates. There are two types of liquidation violations: cash liquidation violations and margin liquidation violation. A cash liquidation violation occurs when you sell a security and use the proceeds to cover the purchase of a different security you bought on a prior trade date. Although similar to a freeriding violation, the primary difference between a liquidation violation and a freeriding violation is that you are selling a security other than the one you purchased and using its proceeds to cover the other trade. The situation: Mr. Lee starts with settled shares of XYZ stock and $100 in settled cash, and buys UVW stock for $1,000. The remaining $900 in settled funds needed to fully pay for the UVW purchase is due by the settlement date onT+2. On T+2, Mr. Lee places an order to sell some of his XYZ stock instead of depositing the $900 he still owes for the UVW stock. The violation: In deciding to initiate a sell order for XYZ stock on the settlement date for his UVW purchase instead of providing the cash he still owed, Mr. Lee committed a liquidation violation. If he had sold enough settled, fully paid for XYZ stock on the same day the bought the UVW stock, that transaction would have settled in time to cover his obligation. The consequence: The first liquidation violation in an account generally results in a notification, but no restrictions. (Note that Schwab may at its discretion impose permanent restrictions or account closures.) The second through fourth non-freeride violations in a rolling 12-month period can lead to a 90-day settled-cash restriction, meaning trading is limited to the amount of settled funds available in your account. At Schwab, clients can use a one-time exception—i.e., once in the life of the account—to remove such a restriction. The fifth violation of any kind generally results in a permanent settled-cash restriction. A margin liquidation violation occurs when your margin account has both a Fed call and a regulatory maintenance call, and you sell securities in the account to cover the calls. A Fed call represents the deposit amount needed to meet the Federal Reserve Board\\'s Regulation T requirement (Reg T) for trades in a margin account. According to Reg T, you may borrow up to 50% of the total purchase price of a margin security, and fund the remaining 50% with cash. A maintenance call occurs when a brokerage account falls below the brokerage firm\\'s established minimum equity requirement. Schwab\\'s maintenance requirement for equity securities is generally 30% of current market value, though this amount may vary depending on the type of security. A regulatory maintenance call occurs when the account falls below the regulatory minimum requirement, which is 25% for equity securities. Extensions At Schwab, if you fail to make payment on a purchase of stock or deliver shares for a sale of stock within the designated time frame, you will receive a notification asking that you take action. If you fail to act upon notification, industry regulations require that Schwab either request an extension, or buy back or sell out the position, as well as mark your account with a freeriding violation. Your account may also be placed on a 90-day settled-cash restriction, or incur more severe penalties, including account closure or removal of electronic access. Again, Schwab clients can request a one-time exception (i.e., once in the life of the account) to remove the restriction. Schwab doesn\\'t grant extensions for trades in retirement accounts (IRAs, SEPs, Keoghs, etc.), or accounts with existing trading restrictions. There are different practices for extensions on purchases and sales. You can contact a Schwab trading specialist at 800-435-9050 for more information about extensions. What are some common situations that can lead to settlement violations? I accidentally placed the trade in the wrong account. It can happen to the most careful of investors. You think you\\'re placing a trade in your margin account, only to find you\\'ve accidentally placed it in your IRA. If you place a trade in the wrong account, contact a Schwab trading specialist immediately at 800-435-9050. Closing out the position yourself may cause a violation. In many cases, Schwab can request a \"cancel and rebill\" to move the trade to the intended account. I traded a non-marginable security in my margin account. If you buy a security that\\'s not marginable then settled funds are required for full payment. Consequently, a settlement violation can occur in a margin account if you buy and then sell a non-marginable security before settled funds have covered the purchase. The order verification screen will alert you if a stock is not marginable. If you\\'re not confident that you can commit to holding a non-marginable security for at least three trading days, consider limiting your purchase to settled funds only. I placed a day trade in my cash account. When a stock trade is completed in a cash account, the funds will not settle for two full trading days. Since a trade held less than two days in a cash account requires settled funds to avoid a good faith violation, it may become necessary to wait at least two days between trades so that the day trades or short-term trades may be executed using settled funds only. Limiting very short-term trades to settled funds will help reduce the risk of violating settlement rules. A bracket or alert fired in my cash account during the settlement period. When a bracket or alert is attached to a security you bought with unsettled funds in a cash account, there\\'s a possibility that the exit trigger (e.g., sell stop, trailing stop, profit exit, etc.) will fire, closing the position and causing a settlement violation. If you need immediate protection on the position via an alert or bracket, consider using settled funds for the purchase, in case the exit is triggered during the settlement period. Alternatively, you could delay activating the alert until the first day the position can be sold without incurring a violation—either the settlement day for the purchase or the settlement day for the funds used to make the purchase. If you decide to simultaneously place the purchase with unsettled funds and immediately attach a bracket or alert, consider giving an additional cushion to the exit parameter(s) to lower the risk of execution within the settlement period. You can always update your exit parameters when the cushion is no longer necessary.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Remember the adage “It’s better to give than to receive”? With proper planning, it’s possible to do both at the same time. Your financial goals may include giving to the causes that are most important to you. As you plan, these strategies can help you make the greatest impact while potentially receiving tax savings too. Ground rules for giving The tax aspects of charitable giving can be complex. It’s always a good idea to consult a tax professional about your giving strategy. That said, here are a few ground rules for charitable giving: Request a receipt if you donate $250 or more to a single charity. If the donation is in cash, you'll need a receipt or supporting bank records, regardless of amount. Get an independent appraisal for gifts of property in excess of $5,000 ($10,000 for closely held stock). You won't need an appraisal for exchange-traded stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Subtract the value of any benefits you received for your charitable contribution (for example books, tapes, meals, entertainment and so on) before you deduct it. Normally, you must itemize your deductions on your tax return if you want to receive a tax benefit for your charitable donations. If your standard deduction exceeds your total itemized deductions, then you likely won’t itemize. You’ll help your favorite charity—which is a good reason on its own to give—but won’t reduce your tax bill. Note: For 2021, you may be able to take a small charitable deduction even if you do not itemize your deductions on your tax return. For 2021 an individual can deduct up to $300 or a married couple can deduct up to $600 if the donations are made to an operating charity in the form of cash.1 There are annual limits on the deductible donation. Under the CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, you can elect to take an increased donations deduction to certain charities, however, its only for cash donations in 2020 and 2021. Under this temporary rule, individuals may deduct 100% of AGI on cash donations to qualifying operating charities (donations to private foundations and donor advised funds are excluded from this rule). If you don’t elect to use the 100% AGI limit, your donations to qualified charities will fall under the normal AGI limits. In generally your donation deduction will be limited to 50% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) —unless you only give cash, in which case the limit increases to 60% of AGI. Whereas, the limit on donating appreciated assets to a qualified charities is 30% of your AGI. These limits are reduced for donations to certain organizations, such as private foundations. Tax treatments by type of gift The tax advantages of a charitable contribution generally depend on three factors: the recipient (only donations to qualified charities are deductible), how you structure the gift, and the type of property you choose to give. Different types of property donations—whether its cash, business assets, or investments—offer different tax advantages and drawbacks: Cash Cash donations are simple, but as previously mentioned, make sure you keep a receipt from the charity or a bank record (such as a canceled check or statement) to substantiate your cash gift, no matter how small. Volunteering You can deduct transportation costs and other expenses related to volunteering. However, the value of volunteer time isn’t deductible. Tangible personal property You can donate almost any item, including old clothing, household goods or vehicles. Gifts of used clothing and household items must be in “good” used condition or better, under IRS tax rules. If the property doesn't relate to the charity's mission, you may deduct the amount you paid for the property or the property's current reasonable value, whichever is less. If property is related to the charity's mission—old clothes donated to the Salvation Army, for example—it's usually fully deductible based on its current reasonable value. Some charities will provide guidance on the value, but it's ultimately up to you to determine the value for tax purposes. Ordinary income property and short-term capital property Ordinary income property normally includes assets such as inventory held for sale by a business, artwork created by the donor, or manufactured items you produced. In addition, any short-term capital assets, such as investments like stock, held for less than a year are also considered to be ordinary income property. If the assets you are donating would have generated ordinary income if it was sold on the day of the donation, then the IRS limits how much you can deduct to the fair market value fair market value reduced by the amount of ordinary income or short-term capital gain that would have been realized. Or to put it another way, your deduction will generally be limited to the cost basis of the asset. There are some notable exemptions to this rule. You may be able to take the full deduction for the FMV of the property if you include the appreciated value of the asset in your gross income on your tax return. Also, if the property you want to donate has decreased in value, your deduction could be further limited (see “Property that has decreased in value” below to learn more). Appreciated long-term capital-gain property You can usually deduct the full fair market value of appreciated long-term assets. These are assets or investments that you've held for more than one year and a day, and can include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or other personal assets like real estate that has appreciated in value. An additional benefit of donating long-term capital assets is you don’t have recognize the capital gain associated with that donation, which means you pay no capital gains tax on that asset. Donating long term assets—especially highly appreciated securities—instead of cash can be a very effective and tax-efficient way to support a charity. Generally, if your assets have appreciated in value, it’s best not to sell securities to generate the cash you need for a donation. Contributing the securities directly to the charity increases the amount of your gift as well as your potential deduction. One rule to remember here is that the deduction is limited to 30% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). If you’re not able to use the entire donation deduction this year, you can still carry forward unused deductions for five years. However, if you’re planning a large donation that’s close to or exceeds your AGI limit, consider talking to a tax professional before making your donation. Here's an example of how donating appreciated investments can increase the amount of a donation. Let’s say Sarah and Steve are married, file a joint tax return, and want to donate $100,000 worth of stock to their local animal shelter. They are in the 35% federal ordinary income tax bracket and are subject to the 20% long term capital gains tax rate, plus the 3.8% net investment income tax. They have two options: they could sell the stock and donate the cash, or they could just donate the stock directly to the charity. The chart below shows that donating the stock would result in a much larger tax savings in this situation. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. 2Assumes a cost basis of $5,000, that the investment has been held for more than a year, and that all realized gains are subject to a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate and the 3.8% net investment income tax. The analysis does not take into account any state or local taxes. \\xad\\xad\\xad3Assumes donor is in the 37% federal income tax bracket and does not take into account any state or local taxes. Certain federal income tax deductions, including the charitable contribution, are available only to taxpayers who itemize deductions, and may be subject to reduction for taxpayers with AGI above certain levels. In addition, deductions for charitable contributions may be limited based on the type of property donated, the type of charity and the donor's AGI. For example, deductions for contributions of appreciated property to public charities generally are limited to 30% of the donor's AGI. Excess contributions may be carried forward for up to five years. Property that has decreased in value For property that has decreased in value below its cost basis, the IRS has a special rule that says you can only take a donation deduction for the fair market value of that asset. In some situations, such as when you have shares of stock that have decreased in value to the point where you have losses, it may be better to sell that asset first and then donate the cash proceeds. By doing so, you may be able to take a capital loss deduction against your other capital gains, and then donate the remaining cash and get a deduction for the donations fair market value. Giving through specialized charitable vehicles While gifts of cash or appreciated investments can be given directly to a charity, it often makes sense to consider specialized charitable vehicles to make giving easier and to manage the tax benefits. If you give regularly, certain giving vehicles such as donor-advised funds or private foundations can make sense. Donor-advised funds, for example, allow you to make a donation of appreciated stock held long-term and receive a current-year tax deduction. You can then grant those assets out over time and have the remaining assets invested so they can grow for future grants to worthwhile charities. If you prefer to leave assets to charity but also earn income for a period of time, a charitable remainder trust (CRT) or pooled income fund is worth exploring. Another donation option to consider if your over age 70 1/2 years is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) from your tax-deferred retirement account, such as a traditional IRA. A QCD is a tax-free distribution from a retirement account that can be donated directly to a qualified charity and does not have to be taken into your income for tax purposes. In addition, a QCD can also be used to meet up to $100,000 of the required minimum distribution for your IRA. It should be noted that there is no tax deduction for a QCD; however, you don’t have to include that distribution into your taxable income. The bottom line Each of these donation strategies and vehicles offers different benefits, but in the end, what really matters is helping an organization that matters to you. The tax benefits from a donation are just icing on the cake. So, compare your options and talk with a financial planner, tax adviser, and/or a philanthropic adviser (such as those at Schwab Charitable) to help determine the best way to give for your particular situation. 1 An operating charity does not include private foundations or donor advised funds.\"},\n",

       "   'content': \"There’s never been a better time to take charge of your own finances. Fund fees and other expenses are lower than ever, and the proliferation of digital tools has put the power of planning firmly in the hands of consumers. Even do-it-yourselfers can set financial goals for themselves, select investments, and designate beneficiaries for their accounts. But everyone has their limits. Some investors lack the discipline, interest, or time required to achieve optimal results. Others face financial circumstances too complicated for any one person to reasonably handle alone. And even experienced investors can use a coach, or consultant, to save time and gain technical expertise as well. “Today’s tools, transparency, and low costs make it easier than ever to manage your own finances, but they also can foster a false sense of security that could put your goals at risk,” says Rob Williams, Certified Financial Planner™ (CFP®) professional and director of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. That’s where personal finance professionals come in. “If you run into challenges, are overwhelmed by the volume of information out there, or would like support when you need it, a professional can help fill in any gaps and provide customized advice,” says CFP® Professional David Jamison with Centralized Planning Group. While getting professional help often comes at a cost, access to professional planners is becoming easier, and expenses should be weighed against the value, as well as potential setbacks that can arise from faulty planning, poor investment decisions, and tax-filing snafus. The trick is figuring out which tasks you can confidently and successfully handle on your own and which you can outsource with support and consultation available when you need it. Here's a look at four key areas of your financial life along with a list of professionals you might consider. 1. Savings The goal-setting aspect of financial planning is a perfect do-it-yourself task, because only you can decide what you want out of life. Maybe you hope to retire at 62, fully finance your child’s college education, or purchase a second home. A guide and counselor can help you attain those goals. “Having a general sense of where you want to end up isn’t the same as making a concrete plan to get there,” David says. “Too often we end up saving what we can and hoping for the best, without any real sense of whether it’s actually enough. And we may think only of retirement, while forgetting or not prioritizing other goals.” This is where a planner is useful. So start by articulating your financial goals, listing them in order of priority, and assigning a dollar amount and due date to each. If you need help prioritizing your goals or estimating your savings targets, Charles Schwab has a number of online resources and tools available to help. Once you’ve sorted out your goals, figure out how much you need to save each month to achieve them. If the prospect of juggling multiple goals feels daunting, a financial planner can help you establish a savings strategy and timeline as well as provide an honest assessment of what is and isn’t possible. Of course, a financial plan is only as good as its execution, which means sticking to your plan through good times and bad. “When unexpected expenses arise or your financial situation changes for the worse, your goals are often the first thing to suffer,” Rob says. But diverging from your savings strategy, even for a short period of time, can significantly undermine your plan. Rob explains, “Setting up recurring contributions can help counter the temptation to cut back on your savings when things get tight. In addition, a written plan that you can refer to and track—with support and check-ins as needed—allows you to remain committed and stay the course.” 2. Investments To create an investment portfolio that supports your goals, first you need to consider your risk tolerance and time frame, which will help determine the appropriate mix of assets for your needs. Keep in mind, too, that you may have multiple goals with different time horizons. For example, you might be planning for retirement as well as your child’s education. Each goal may benefit from an allocation of their own. After determining your target asset allocation for each goal, start researching and selecting investments. “This is often the step where people stall,” David cautions. “With so many investments to choose from, it’s hard to know where to start or how to evaluate comparable choices.” Fortunately, a variety of investment options can help build and monitor your portfolio—from investing in set-it-and-forget-it target-date funds and using a portfolio builder to employing a professional investment manager and an algorithm-based robo-advisor. “In the past, you had to have considerable savings to get quality advice,” Rob says. “But these days, you can get top-level portfolio management at a low cost that’s backed by research as sophisticated as that offered to institutions or at higher cost.” Even those who’ve successfully managed their own investments during their working lives may benefit from outside guidance, a process, and a plan as they approach retirement, when income generation (as opposed to wealth accumulation) takes center stage. “When you reach those inflection points in your investing life, you want to know you’re making the right decisions,” David asserts. “To me, the right decision means knowing my options and selecting the one that best aligns with my goals and preferences. Working with a professional can help you think through the alternatives and choose a path—and steps—with confidence.” 3. Taxes If your tax situation is relatively straightforward, you may not benefit much from having someone else do your taxes or help with multi-year tax planning. However, if you run a small business, own rental properties, or have multiple investment accounts or other more complex financial needs, you have a greater chance of running afoul of tax laws or, perhaps as importantly, missing out on tax-saving opportunities each year and the life of your plan. Hiring a Certified Public Accountant to prepare and file your taxes can help ensure you pay your due—and not a penny more. That said, there’s a big difference between preparing your taxes once a year and managing them daily. “Taxes are one of the biggest expenses investors face, but employing simple strategies can make them more manageable,” Rob says. “If you buy, sell, and manage your investments with tax-efficiency in mind, you stand to save a lot of money in the long run.” Such tax-smart strategies include: Making charitable donations for maximum tax benefit. Optimizing your investments across taxable, tax-advantaged, and tax-deferred accounts. Using investment losses to offset investment gains and/or ordinary income. “There are a variety of strategies you can deploy to minimize your tax bill,” Rob says. “The challenge for many investors is knowing what they are and how to implement them effectively.” A financial planner can help you identify areas to improve tax-efficiency, including strategies you can consider each year and map out in your plan. Also, the planner may recommend working with a tax professional, who can help with everything from creating a charitable-giving strategy to timing the sale of your investments to managing the required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your tax-deferred retirement accounts as mandated by the IRS. “A lot of people make costly mistakes that are perfectly avoidable,” David says. “Working with a tax pro can help you make sure you’re on the right path, and they can proactively bring up strategies to improve your specific tax situation.” But there are more proactive strategies, such as tax-efficient investing, you can consider to help keep more of the wealth you build—and use—over time. 4. Estate planning People tend to think estate planning is only for the very wealthy, but if you have any assets whatsoever—such as a house, investments, or retirement accounts—it’s critical to articulate what to do with them once you pass away. “Some estate-planning tasks, such as designating beneficiaries for retirement assets, are as simple as logging in to your financial accounts and filling out a form,” David says. Others are slightly more complicated but still perfectly manageable, like confirming your assets are titled correctly and updating your will. If you need to create or update any legal documents, however, working with an estate attorney can save you—and your heirs—a lot of headaches. “Unless you have a very simple estate—no kids, no house, no assets outside of your retirement accounts—you’re probably better off working with someone who can tailor your estate documents to your specific circumstances,” Rob suggests. “At minimum, it’s important to have a will, beneficiary designations that match your intentions, and other basic documents in the case of incapacity or other healthcare events.” These are relatively easy to create and should be in the file of any family or investor. Some attorneys will charge a flat fee for basic estate documents, but others may charge by the hour, which is why both David and Rob recommend doing some of the legwork before you meet with one. “The most important thing is the not-so-small task of figuring out in advance who inherits what and how they should receive it. That way, you’re paying the attorney to create the correct documents that carry out your wishes instead of the attorney running up a tab working through questions only you can answer,” David says. Some of these tasks can be achieved through titling and beneficiary designations while others might be included in a will or other documents. Ask a financial planner for estate planning guidelines.

       "   'abstract': 'There are ways to build retirement security for a nonworking spouse, but it takes careful planning as a couple.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I'm 65 and my husband is 60. We're trying to plan for retirement. My husband isn't working and doesn't have a retirement account. I'd like to keep working for a few more years. Here are my questions: Can I open an IRA for him? Can he receive Social Security benefits on my work record? And do I have to retire for him to be eligible? —A Reader Dear Reader, These are three great questions, so thanks for asking. While each couple's situation is different, there are ways to build retirement security for a nonworking spouse that every couple should be aware of—and take advantage of if they can. Let's go in order. #1: Yes, you can open and fund a spousal IRA Usually you have to have earned income to open and fund an IRA, but not with a spousal IRA. If you're married filing a joint tax return, you can contribute funds into two separate IRAs—one for your nonworking spouse and one for you—as long as you have enough earned income to cover both contributions. Since you're both over age 50, you can currently contribute up to $7,000 ($6,000 plus a $1,000 catch-up) into each account. You'd just have to have earned income of $14,000 or more to max out both contributions. Tax deductibility is another issue. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be fully tax-deductible. However, if you participate in a 401(k) or pension plan at work, and earn more than $125,000 in 2021 ($129,000 in 2022), contributions to your own or to a spousal IRA aren't tax deductible. If your contributions are tax-deductible, you'll pay ordinary income taxes on withdrawals come retirement. If you're not concerned about tax deductibility, you might want to consider opening a spousal Roth IRA, as long as you meet the income limits (under $198,000 in 2021; under $204,000 in 2022). The advantage of a Roth is that, although you don't get an upfront tax deduction on a contribution, withdrawals of earnings are tax-free if you're over 59 1/2 and you've held the account for at least five years. That could be important since you're close to retirement. So before you open a spousal IRA, you might want to talk to your tax advisor. #2: Yes, your spouse can collect Social Security benefits on your work record The short answer to your next question is yes, a nonworking spouse who has reached age 62 can collect Social Security benefits based on the working spouse's earnings record once the working spouse has filed for benefits. So, in your situation, if you filed for benefits at your full retirement age (66 and 4 months if you turned 65 this year) your husband would be able to file for benefits on your work record as early as age 62. But before you proceed, there are some important rules and exceptions to think about. The maximum Social Security benefit of a nonworking spouse is up to 50 percent of the working spouse's benefit at FRA. So if, for example, your FRA benefit is $2,000/month, your spouse would be able to collect up to $1,000 at his FRA. If you were to file for benefits before reaching your FRA, your own benefit would be reduced, but it would not impact the benefit amount of your spouse. Spousal benefits are based on the projected FRA benefit, not on the actual benefit taken. BUT, if a nonworking spouse files for the spousal benefit before their own FRA, that benefit would be reduced accordingly. For instance, your husband's FRA is 67 based on his age. If he filed for a spousal benefit at 62, his monthly benefit would be permanently reduced by 32.5 percent. For the record, there is an exception to the age requirement if your spouse is caring for your child who is under age 16. Also note that there's no advantage for your husband to postpone filing beyond his FRA. Unlike the worker's benefit, which continues to increase until age 70, spousal benefits max out at FRA. As you can see, nothing is cut and dried. #3: No you don't have to retire, but timing is extra important To answer your third question, you don't have to officially retire for your husband to collect Social Security on your work record, but you do have to file for your own benefits for him to be eligible. And here's where you need to be extra thoughtful. Deciding when to take Social Security is important because it not only affects your own benefits, but also survivor benefits. (Survivor benefits are up to 100 percent of the highest earning spouse's benefit depending on when the survivor claims.) As I mentioned, when you file for Social Security before your FRA, your benefits are reduced permanently. Plus it would reduce his survivor benefits should he outlive you. On the flip side, your benefits will go up approximately 8 percent a year for each year you wait past your FRA, up to age 70. Again, that affects only the amount of your own benefit, not the spousal benefit. Here are some things to consider as you make your decision: If you wait until you reach your FRA to file, you'll increase your benefit and the potential survivor benefit for your husband. At your FRA, you can continue to work with no deductions to your own benefit. If you can hold off even longer—until age 70—you'll receive the highest possible retirement benefit for yourself and the highest possible survivor benefit for your husband, but it won't increase the spousal benefit. And your husband would also have to wait to file. Of course, your health, other available resources, and desire and ability to continue to work are also relevant. So as you can see, it can get complicated. To help you decide what's best, I suggest you consult a financial advisor who can help you explore different Social Security claiming strategies. Bottom line It's definitely possible to build retirement security for a nonworking spouse. But how you go about it can impact the overall retirement strategy for both of you. Talk together. Plan together. Check in with an advisor for extra help. And take full advantage of everything you can. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'TIPS can be a buffer against long-term inflation, but TIPS investing isn’t always straightforward. Here are answers to frequently asked questions.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Inflation continues to be a concern these days, and many investors are looking for investments that can keep pace with, or hopefully beat, the rate of inflation. As a result, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, have become a popular investment option. But investing in TIPS isn\\'t always straightforward. They have many unique characteristics that can make the investing experience a bit confusing. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about the TIPS market: 1. What are Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities? Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are a type of U.S. Treasury security whose principal value is indexed to the rate of inflation. When inflation rises, the TIPS\\' principal value is adjusted up. If there\\'s deflation, then the principal value is adjusted lower. Like traditional Treasuries, TIPS are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Although there are many measures of inflation, TIPS are referenced to one specific index: the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. 2. Will TIPS coupon payments fluctuate with the level of inflation, as well? Yes. The coupon rate won\\'t change but the coupon payment will. TIPS have fixed coupon rates, which are based on the principal value of the security. If inflation rises, that rate is based off a higher principal amount. If inflation rises, so do the coupon payments. The table below provides a hypothetical look at a TIPS principal value and coupon payment based on a constant 3% rise in inflation. How TIPS principal values and coupon payments can adjust to inflation Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. The annual coupon payment equals the fixed coupon rate multiplied the adjusted principal value. Note that the initial TIPS principal value is $1,000 and TIPS coupon payments are actually paid on a semiannual basis, not an annual basis like this example illustrates. Example is hypothetical, for illustrative purposes only. 3. What sort of yields do TIPS offer today? All TIPS yields are negative today.1 While that might surprise many investors, consider the yields of nominal (non-inflation-protected) Treasuries. The 10-year Treasury yield is still positive at around 1.5%, but after the rate of inflation is accounted for, that inflation-adjusted yield is also well below zero. All TIPS yields are below zero today Source: Bloomberg, as of 12/7/2021. US Treasury Inflation Indexed Curve (YCGT0169). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 4. TIPS yields are negative? Doesn\\'t that mean investors would lose money? Not necessarily, because nominal returns can still be positive. A nominal return doesn\\'t account for the effects of inflation, while a \"real\" total return incorporates the effect of inflation. By investing in an individual TIPS with a negative \"real\" yield and holding that TIPS to maturity, an investor would be locking in a loss relative to the rate of inflation. In this case, TIPS can help the investor keep pace with inflation, but not beat inflation. Nominal total returns can still be positive, however. For example, assume a 10-year TIPS has a real yield of negative 1.0%. If inflation averaged over 1% per year, the nominal total return on this TIPS would still be positive, as the annual inflation adjustment would offset that annualized negative real yield. The higher inflation goes, the higher the nominal total return of a TIPS can go; the same can\\'t be said for the total return of a traditional Treasury. 5. How can I compare TIPS to traditional Treasuries? Breakeven rates. A breakeven rate is the difference between the yield of a TIPS and the yield of a traditional Treasury of a comparable maturity. That difference is what inflation would need to average over the life of the TIPS for it to outperform the traditional Treasury. For example, a five-year TIPS offers a yield of roughly negative 1.6% today, compared with a 1.2% yield for a traditional five-year Treasury. That difference is 2.8% (note that the TIPS yield is negative). If the CPI were to average more than 2.8% per year for the next five years, then that TIPS would provide a higher total return than the traditional Treasury. If inflation averaged less than 2.8%, then the traditional Treasury would outperform the TIPS. When evaluating TIPS, the breakeven rate matters just as much as your outlook for inflation. Breakevens have fallen from their recent highs but are still elevated compared to history—the average five-year breakeven rate since inception is 1.85%. Five-year breakeven rates are off the all-time highs but still remain elevated Source: Bloomberg, using weekly data as of 12/7/2021. US Breakeven 5 Year (USGGBE05 Index). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 6. Would an investor beat inflation with TIPS? It\\'s not likely to beat inflation with individual TIPS at today\\'s yields that are held to maturity. For investors who purchase individual TIPS, the negative yields mean that they are essentially locking in that negative yield regardless of how high (or low) inflation goes. Even if inflation surges, the TIPS principal value is simply rising by the same rate as inflation, but not enough to offset the premium the investor paid (that premium that resulted in a negative yield.) It also depends on the time horizon. With negative yields, it\\'s still possible for returns to beat inflation over the short run. Whether one holds individual TIPS or invests using a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF), total returns over short investing horizons can beat inflation. Although past performance is no guarantee of future results, note that in the 12 months ending November 30, 2021, the Bloomberg U.S. TIPS Index delivered a total return of 6.8%, even though the starting yield was negative. 7. If inflation rises sharply, will TIPS perform well over the short term? It depends. In addition to the inflation adjustments, TIPS performance over the short run is also driven by price appreciation or depreciation depending on any change in the TIPS\\' yields. If yields rise enough where a TIPS\\'s price declines enough to offset the inflation adjustment, total returns can be negative. Likewise, if yields fall further and prices rise in the short-run, total returns may be strong given both price appreciation and the inflation adjustment. With yields so low, however, we do see a risk in yields moving modestly higher into 2022, which may limit the total return potential for TIPS investments. For that reason, we stop short of calling TIPS a good inflation \"hedge,\" especially over the short run. Over the long run, however, TIPS are one of the most straightforward ways to protect against inflation. 8. What’s the best way to invest in TIPS? You can invest in TIPS either by holding individual bonds, or through a mutual fund or ETF. There are pros and cons to each approach. By holding individual bonds, you can plan to hold to maturity, meaning any short-term price fluctuations might not matter. Individual TIPS also can be good planning tools. While the amount at maturity isn\\'t totally known in advance, given the principal adjustments, investors can expect a return of at least the original $1,000 principal plus or minus the principal adjustment. With a mutual fund or ETF you can get more diversification than might be achieved by buying individual TIPS yourself, and usually at a low cost depending on the fund. You also get the benefit of professional management, and potentially better pricing on the bonds than you might get by investing in individual bonds yourself. Mutual funds and ETFs don\\'t usually have a maturity date, so their prices or net asset values (NAV) will fluctuate, and there\\'s no certainty about what that price or NAV will be at a point in the future. 9. When I look at various mutual funds or ETFs that hold TIPS, why are the stated yields so different? TIPS mutual fund or ETF yields may appear distorted due to short-term fluctuations in the CPI, and they might not be reflective of the market yield of the underlying securities. While individual TIPS yields are currently all negative2, the quoted yields of many TIPS funds are positive because they include inflation compensation. The discrepancy stems from how some of the yields are calculated, since calculations may differ across fund sponsors. The SEC 30-day yield looks at dividends and interest paid over only one month and annualizes it, showing what the yield would be if it persisted for 12 months. While it\\'s a standardized yield, it can overstate the actual yield if a very high monthly CPI reading results in a higher-than-expected monthly distribution. Likewise, a very low or negative yield could be attributable to the fall in inflation rate and might not be repeated. Meanwhile, the distribution yield, or \"trailing 12-month\" yield is backward-looking, reflecting payments made over the last 12 months, and therefore might not be a strong indicator of what to expect in the future. As is the case with differing yield calculation conventions across fund sponsors, distribution schedules also differ across funds and fund sponsors. So at any point in time, distribution yield comparisons may reflect these differences When considering TIPS mutual funds or ETFs, check for any other discrepancies with the stated yields. If a fund\\'s yield is dramatically different from the yield of the underlying holdings, try to figure out what\\'s causing the difference, so your expectations will be more accurate. If a distribution in a single month has distorted a bond fund\\'s yield, don\\'t let that distort your expectations going forward. 10. Why have the monthly income payments from my TIPS funds declined when inflation is still so high? Every TIPS mutual fund or ETF is different, but there may be a lag from when a given month\\'s CPI is released and when it is considered for the distribution. For example, the CPI reading for the month of January won\\'t be released until mid-February, but then that inflation adjustment might not be reflected in the fund distribution until a month or two later. \"High inflation\" is a relative term, of course. A given month\\'s change in CPI might be high by historical standards, but if it\\'s less than the previous month\\'s change, then the monthly distribution could decline. Keep in mind that these are just high-level guidelines—there are a number of factors that go into a fund\\'s distribution, not just the level of inflation. Each mutual fund or ETF may also have its own guidelines for how it calculates its monthly distributions. What to do now TIPS are worth considering today, especially for those investors worried about inflation. Keep in mind that breakeven rates are very high today, so the cost of inflation protection is expensive. If actual inflation doesn’t meet the lofty expectations, TIPS could underperform traditional Treasuries. Despite their current negative yields, TIPS are still one of the most straightforward ways to protect against inflation over the long run. For investors who currently have an allocation to high-quality, highly rated bond investments like Treasuries (but no exposure to TIPS), it makes sense to consider shifting some of that exposure to TIPS to help protect against long-term or unexpected surges in inflation. Just remember that they are still subject to the inverse relationship between their prices and yields like traditional Treasuries, and that they could underperform traditional Treasuries if inflation comes back down to more normal levels. 1 Source: Bloomberg, as of 12/7/2021.

       "   'content': 'The S&P 500 index is up more than 20% so far this year, but more than 90% of its member stocks have had \"correction\" level drawdowns—more than 10% from a peak—at some point this year. In short, while overall stock market performance has been strong, there has been a lot of churn beneath the surface. Will U.S. stock indices begin to reflect more of that weakness in 2022? It\\'s possible, especially as the world\\'s major central banks begin to drain the liquidity that has supported financial markets since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. But major uncertainties remain, including the pace of inflation, how central banks will react to it, and the direction of the virus. Illustration by Charlos Gary. © 2021 Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. U.S. stocks and economy: Under pressure The 2020 pandemic-sparked recession was sharp and short at only two months. The rebound in economic activity also has been sharp, but uneven, as the services sector faced rolling social-distancing restrictions while demand for goods and materials surged. The question heading into 2022 is where the economy goes from here. Illustration by Charlos Gary. © 2021 Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. COVID-19 remains a risk. At the moment, it\\'s unknown whether its latest variant, omicron, will respond to current vaccines and treatments, and ultimately how disruptive it will be. What we\\'ve learned since the pandemic began, however, is that it\\'s the societal restrictions and/or lockdowns imposed that cause the most economic damage—and countries have had vastly different reactions in this regard. The pandemic also has exposed instability in complex global supply chains, possibly heralding a long-term environment of pervasive supply shocks, rather than the demand shocks that were more commonplace for much of the past two decades. In terms of the U.S. stock market, for all the talk of its resiliency, there has been a significant amount of churn beneath the surface. Although major stock indices were up strongly year-to-date (as of Nov. 26th), most of their member stocks had undergone a drop of 10% at some point during the time period (since we published our U.S. market outlook on Nov. 26th, the average drawdowns have gotten a little worse because of recent market volatility).

Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Although these rotational corrections are preferable to watching the bottom fall out all at once, there is a risk that the major stock indices at some point will reflect more of the weakness that has persisted under the surface. Macroeconomic backdrops that include slower growth and tightening monetary policy tend to usher in higher intra-market correlations—that is, the potential for securities to rise and fall in tandem—as well as greater \"tail risk,\" i.e., the probability that an investment will move more than three standard deviations beyond its historical mean. However, we\\'re in no way suggesting that investors should \"get out\" of the stock market. Neither getting in nor getting out is an investing strategy; they simply represent gambling on moments in time, whereas investing should always be a disciplined process over time. This discipline should involve diversification—across and within asset classes—and periodic rebalancing (that is, trimming positions or asset classes that have appreciated and become overweight in relation to the rest of your portfolio, and moving the proceeds to assets that have become underweight). We also recommend focusing on high-quality stocks, those of companies that have characteristics such as strong balance sheets, healthy free-cash flow, and stable-to-improving earnings trends. Global stocks and economy: Slowing but not slow A high tide of growth, aided by a sea change in fiscal policy, is likely to help float the global economy safely over the rocks of risks in 2022, despite waves of worry emanating from COVID-19, inflation, materials shortages, and rate hikes. Illustration by Charlos Gary. © 2021 Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. New COVID variants (e.g., omicron) present risks to the global economic outlook, but the economic and market impact will likely depend on policymaker responses. Based on what we know now, those responses don\\'t appear likely to derail global growth. Prior COVID waves tended to be buying opportunities. Yet, markets could remain volatile as more information on variants becomes available. Global gross domestic product (GDP) has surpassed its pre-pandemic level in 2021 and completed the transition from recovery to expansion, aided by strong policy support, the deployment of effective vaccines and the resumption of economic activities. In 2022, global GDP is anticipated to grow around 5%, forming the strongest back-to-back years for the world economy since the early 1970s. The likelihood of additional fiscal support in Europe, Japan, and the United States combined with the spending of pent-up savings by consumers and businesses supports global growth prospects. China\\'s policies in 2022 may offer targeted support for favored industries, allowing economic growth to slow only modestly. Although monetary policy may begin to tighten, the slow pace of withdrawal from pandemic-era policies may limit any negative impact on stock valuations. Inflation pressures are likely to ease over the course of the year; some of 2021\\'s shortages may turn into gluts by the second half of 2022. Historically, when global growth is above average, international stocks have tended to perform well, even when that growth rate is slowing, due to a high weighting in economically sensitive sectors, as you can see in the chart below. Average additional annual total return, EAFE minus USA indices (number of years) Average additional annual total return, EAFE minus USA indices (number of years) World nominal GDP Above average Below average Accelerating 8.4% (15) 0.0% (10) Decelerating 1.4% (9) -8.4% (16) Source Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 11/17/2021.

The EAFE Index serves as a performance benchmark for the major international equity markets as represented by 21 major MSCI indices from Europe, Australasia, and the Middle East, excluding the U.S. and Canada. The MSCI USA Index is designed to measure the performance of the large -and mid-cap segments of the U.S. market; with 602 constituents, the index covers approximately 84% of the free float-adjusted U.S. market capitalization. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For investors, this underscores the importance of global diversification—making sure your portfolio includes an appropriate allocation to international as well as U.S. stocks, based on your goals, investing timeline and risk tolerance. Fixed Income: Rough waters It wasn\\'t exactly smooth sailing for fixed income investors in 2021. The faster-than-expected reopening of the economy from COVID-19 shutdowns early in the year led to a surge in yields during the first quarter, only to be followed by a plunge in the summer as virus cases rebounded. Inflation expectations have risen, but mostly for shorter time horizons. We see more rough waters ahead in 2022, but also more potential opportunities for bond investors looking for income. Yields will likely move higher for all maturities with more volatility as the support from easy monetary policy ebbs. Illustration by Charlos Gary. © 2021 Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. The one trend that\\'s clear for 2022 is that the ultra-loose monetary policies pursued by central banks since the onset of the pandemic are ending. Less easy money circulating should mean higher interest rates and a decline in the relative value of risk assets, but the effects depend on the pace and magnitude of the policy shift. When central banks tighten policy quickly, the yield curve—that is, the difference between short-term and longer-term yields—tends to flatten on expectations that a reduction in credit flowing to the economy will slow growth. When central banks are slow to tighten policy, the yield curve tends to steepen as it allows inflation pressures to build. For riskier segments of the fixed income markets, like high-yield corporate bonds, a series of fast rate hikes would likely cause a sharper decline in prices than a slow pace since it would signal the potential for a sharper slowdown in growth. The Federal Reserve has signaled that it will taper its bond purchases, but it\\'s still unclear when it will pivot to rate hikes. Currently, the market is pricing in a series of rate hikes over the next two years. That\\'s well ahead of the Fed\\'s most recent estimates, which indicate a slower path of rate hikes. However, the market\\'s estimate of the peak in the federal funds rate (the terminal rate) is lower than the Fed\\'s estimate, implying a less pessimistic view of inflation long-term.

As the tide moves out on the ultra-easy monetary policies of central banks in 2022, we suggest looking for potential opportunities to add to intermediate- and long-term bond holdings as yields move higher. While there may be periods when the yield curve steepens, long-term demand for low-risk bonds remains strong, as aging populations around the globe are driving up savings and the demand for safe yields. Bond ladders or barbells can be effective strategies for averaging into higher yields over time. We also suggest a more careful approach to the riskier segments of the fixed income markets, such as high-yield corporate and emerging-market bonds. While current conditions are still positive, valuations appear stretched and vulnerable to a shift in the outlook for the economy.'},\n",

       "   'content': '2021 has been a boom year for equity markets, while inflation expectations have shifted, and many workers in the emerging post-COVID world have reconsidered what their work, finances, time, and health mean to them. As always, we believe that successful investors start with a plan—whether it\\'s to start saving and investing, or to manage, protect, and use wealth they already have. Heading into 2022, we see three trends that could have implications for financial planning and wealth management: Inflation rising Tax debate shifting Embracing change post-COVID Here\\'s an overview, with takeaways to navigate the year ahead. Inflation is rising Inflation measures rose sharply at the end of 2021 to over 6% for the consumer price index for urban consumers (CPI-U) and just over 4% from CPI-U less food and energy, the highest year-over-year increase since 1991. Inflation above the Federal Reserve\\'s 2% targeted annual rate may persist, but we don\\'t expect 1970s-style inflation or inflation levels. A modest amount of inflation is healthy. An unplanned for, unexpected, or prolonged inflationary spike is more concerning; however, we don\\'t think a prolonged inflation increase is occurring now. Keep an eye on market commentary from Schwab strategists for the latest on inflation. Whether higher overall inflation persists or not, it\\'s key to have a plan. Here are steps to consider now: Embrace diversity A portfolio includes many pieces, and each piece plays a role. As part of a diversified portfolio, stocks (in particular small cap stocks), real estate investment trusts, and non-US international investments have historically provided returns that keep pace with or exceed inflation and economic growth. Cash, as well as traditional bonds, provide little-to-no inflation protection, but they still play an important role in a diversified portfolio for diversification and liquidity. Adding Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), which are US Treasury bonds whose principal value increases with inflation, can provide an inflation hedge as well. Consider all income and assets A comprehensive financial plan focused on retirement includes various income sources and assets, including Social Security, a pension (for some), a home and perhaps other real estate, an opportunity for part-time work, and other assets. Some of these income sources and assets provide more protection against unexpectedly high inflation than others. Home prices, for example, have already appreciated dramatically in many areas, and Social Security recipients will see a 5.9% cost of living increase to their payments starting in 2022. Consider all income and assets, including Social Security, when considering your exposure to inflation risk. Test your financial plan A proper financial plan is neither a \"success\" nor a \"failure.\" It\\'s a projection of what we expect could happen based on today\\'s assumptions and financial goals, and a tool to help with the what-ifs in life. For example, what if your investments are better or worse than projected? What if there\\'s a spike in inflation? What if you live shorter or longer than anticipated? Testing your financial plan with different scenarios can help you be prepared. Tax-awareness is still important After inflation, taxes have been the top wealth management topic in our 2021 client conversations. As of this writing, the Build Back Better bill includes almost no major tax increases for individuals with the exception of a 5% surtax on adjusted gross income over $10 million, and an additional 3% surtax over $25 million. Proposals in the bill passed by the House in mid-November could change before being voted on in the Senate, but, unless the direction of negotiation shift suddenly, we aren\\'t currently expecting major changes in tax law for 2022. Regardless of what happens in Washington, investors should plan and invest in a tax-aware manner. Here are strategies to consider now: Take tax-advantaged accounts seriously Investors can take relatively simple steps to cut taxes on their investments. First, maximize every opportunity for tax-advantaged saving and investing in employer-sponsored retirement accounts, IRAs, Roth IRAs, and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). All tax-advantaged accounts can help boost wealth, but HSAs (if used for qualified medical expenses*) and Roth accounts are extremely helpful to fund now if you believe your taxes will be higher in the future or want diversification of accounts based on tax treatment to provide flexibility to manage taxes in retirement. Whatever tax-advantaged account you select, make sure to receive the full employer match in employer-sponsored accounts, such as a 401(K), if available to you. Cut taxes in brokerage accounts Every dollar from interest or dividends earned in taxable brokerage accounts is taxed when earned, with some exceptions, including interest earned on tax-exempt municipal bonds. And, any trade, sale, or investment that results in a gain—or loss—potentially results in a taxable event. Attention to tax-smart investing can have a sizable impact on after-tax wealth over time. Consider these strategies: Reduce turnover in brokerage accounts. When you sell and \"realize\" a gain in a taxable brokerage tax, you may owe tax on the gain. If you trade actively and don\\'t hold the investment for more than a year, you\\'ll pay short-term capital gain tax rates, which are the same as the ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gains on investments held longer than a year are taxed at a lower, preferential tax rate. These transactions create tax drag. If you trade actively, consider doing so in tax-advantaged accounts such as an IRA or Roth. Hold high-income investments that generate current tax-year liabilities in retirement accounts. Interest earned on high-yield bonds and other higher yielding investments, as well as dividends paid from REITs held in taxable accounts, are taxed when interest or dividends are paid. To reduce tax drag, consider holding higher income earning investments, especially those not taxed at preferred tax rates (e.g., qualified dividends paid by most dividend-paying stocks held for longer than 60 days and dividend-paying stock funds) in retirement accounts. Consider both tax-loss and tax-gain harvesting. Tax-loss harvesting is a common technique to sell investments in a taxable account with unrealized capital losses to realize that loss and use it to offset realized capital gains, if any. And with tax-gain harvesting, by selling some of your winners you could actually help reduce future taxes and create a more balanced portfolio. Plan for current tax laws to sunset by 2026 Tax changes implemented via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) will expire at the end of 2025. At that time, absent a new law, ordinary income tax brackets will increase to pre-TCJA rates, and the estate tax exemption will decrease to pre-TCJA levels. Consider the strategies below if your estate is at or close to $5 million or above: Annual exclusion gifting. Individuals can give up to $15,000 tax-free to an unlimited number of donees without utilizing any of their lifetime gift tax exemption (currently $11.7 million per individual, scheduled to fall after the TCJA sunsets). Those who do not wish to gift outright to their intended donees could consider an irrevocable trust that would allow them to make annual exclusion gifts while controlling how the gifts are later dispersed. Spousal lifetime access trusts (SLATs). These remain a popular method for married couples to lock in the \"bonus\" lifetime exemption allowed under the TCJA. SLATs allow the donor spouse to have indirect access to gifted assets by means of the beneficiary spouse. Investors with $20 million or more should consider using a SLAT to lock in the current lifetime exemption while maintaining some access to the gifted assets. Charitable lead trusts (CLTs). Those who are charitably minded and are facing an abnormally large income tax bill in 2021 due to a large Roth conversion, sale of a business, or the sale of other highly appreciated assets should consider the use of a charitable lead trust in combination with a donor advised fund (DAF) to help mitigate their income tax liability. Embracing change post-COVID COVID has led many people to reconsider what their work, finances, time, and health mean to them. Reflect on these issues for you, your family, and your personal goals and priorities. Having a financial plan helps you have a foundation in place to manage risks if conditions change. Leaving the workforce Every year you earn a wage is one less year you\\'ll need to tap other income sources, such as Social Security or retirement savings. If you decide to leave a job or retire earlier than planned, keep in mind that the longer you wait to claim Social Security beyond age 62 (up to age 70), the higher the \"pay raise\" you\\'ll receive in inflation-adjusted income thereafter for the rest of your life and, if applicable, your spouse\\'s life. Full- or part-time work may help manage inflation, as wages in this cycle have been rising as some workers have left the workforce. Health and healthcare costs are a factor Anxiety tends to arise from the unknown or unbounded. And for many, current and future health and healthcare costs are likely a source of anxiety. A solution to that anxiety is to plan for healthcare costs. Another is to broaden your notion of financial health to also include physical health. Lack of attention to basic healthcare is tightly correlated with potential future costs. No one can accurately predict future healthcare events, but they can take simple steps to lower the probabilities of those events and plan, including saving for healthcare and understanding health insurance (in particular Medicare while transitioning into and living in retirement). Be prepared for tides to shift Market volatility comes at any time. If you don\\'t feel you can stomach it, or know you\\'ll need money from your portfolio soon, prepare for it. The important difference between financial planning and wealth management versus institutional investing (such as pensions, endowments, and mutual funds) is that individuals may not have the time or tolerance (how much risk can you stomach) to work through market corrections like an institution does. For anyone who needs money from investments soon, we recommend allocating that sum to cash or high-quality shorter-duration bonds or bond funds. Then continue the rest based on your time horizon and risk tolerance. What to do now Navigating trends versus responding reactively or emotionally is best done in the context of a comprehensive financial, investment, or wealth management plan. Financial planning, investing, and wealth management can work to manage risks, prioritize and achieve goals, and then manage, protect, and distribute wealth. Use these trends and their possible implications as the starting point for a conversation about your financial, investing, or wealth management plan this year. * HSA withdrawals that are not used for qualified medical expenses are subject to ordinary income tax and prior to age 65 may be subject to a 20% federal tax penalty.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'As we enter the holiday gift giving season, let’s think outside the metaphorical—and physical—box.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, Here we go again. The holiday giving season is upon us, and too often along with that comes the pressure to buy something—sometimes anything—for an ever growing list of extended family, friends and co-workers. But this year, I’m hoping for something different. While the last two years have been challenging, I think they've given us an opportunity to reflect on our personal values and rethink how we spend our time and our money. Add in today's higher prices and shortages of certain goods, and it only makes sense to move away from our old ways of thinking about holiday giving—and avoid the buying frenzy. Don’t get me wrong. I love giving gifts and I love getting gifts. But here’s the catch—I don’t love giving or getting a gift if it feels like an obligation. Or when you buy something you’re pretty sure the other person doesn’t even want. And especially if that gift isn’t affordable. So, I have a suggestion. Instead of feeling compelled to mindlessly buy, buy, buy, stop and think carefully about who you most want to recognize, and how you can do that in the most meaningful way—perhaps without giving a physical object, and certainly without breaking the bank. Make a list Much like you'd plan a party, take your time to think carefully about the people you want to acknowledge with a gift. Instead of automatically including every family member, friend and co-worker, be thoughtful about whom you really want to include. Make a budget If you haven’t already, figure out exactly how much you can afford to pay for all of your gifts this year. Choose an amount that doesn’t eat into your necessities or your emergency savings, and stick to it! In the age of online shopping and buy now, pay later options, it's way too easy to buy on impulse and overspend. Often the best gifts cost very little. Be creative Now that you have your list of recipients and your budget, it’s time to mesh the two and start to brainstorm. And try to think outside the metaphorical—and physical—box. Of course, some families, especially those with young children, delight in opening physical gifts, but a number of studies have shown that most people derive more long-lasting happiness from experiences rather than material possessions. Just for starters, how about volunteering to babysit for new parents, complete with a dinner out? Dog-sitting for a pandemic pet? Or giving a young family a membership to the local zoo or museum? Perhaps your parents would enjoy a few lessons in ballroom dancing or tickets to the local theatre. A teen might be thrilled to work with an athletic coach, or might appreciate a boost to their savings or 529 account. Others might be grateful for a gift to charity made in their honor. And don’t neglect your own talents. Are you an accomplished chef? How about giving someone a home-cooked meal, featuring their favorite dishes? If you’re an artist, perhaps you can offer a ‘paint and sip’ evening? Or if you have a green thumb, you could help a neighbor plant their garden. The possibilities for meaningful gifts are really endless, and there are options for every budget. Be open If you've been stuck in a gift rut for many years, it might be time to reset expectations with your friends and family. To avoid misunderstandings and potential disappointments, speak up! Explain how you feel, and talk about your new approach ahead of time. And don’t feel that you have to apologize. Open, honest communication is key. My guess is that many others feel the same way, and will appreciate your taking the lead on new ways to enjoy the holiday season. As we look ahead to the holidays, let’s all enjoy this moment at the same time that we remember the lessons we've learned in the last two years. We can acknowledge each other—families, friends and co-workers—in a way that resonates with our values and the future we want to build. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': 'Bear with us as (no pun intended) you read this longer-than-usual outlook. The 2020 COVID recession was sharp, but short at only two months; while the rebound in activity has also been sharp, but uneven across economic metrics. Overall gross domestic product (GDP) moved from the recovery phase to the expansion phase as of the second quarter of 2021. As highlighted in the visual below, the question heading into 2022 is where we go from here—especially due to the stark reminder on this year’s \"Bleak Friday\" that the pandemic is nowhere near behind us. Oh c\\'mon omicron! How many times over the past 18 months have we started to breathe signs of relief that the pandemic was rounding the corner to becoming endemic, only to be hit by second or third waves, the delta variant and now the omicron variant? Based on initial World Health Organization (WHO) findings, the omicron variant spreads more quickly, can cause more serious cases, and/or may decrease the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments. What we\\'ve learned from the delta variant is that it\\'s difficult to arrest the spread. What the entire world has learned throughout the pandemic, however, is that it\\'s the restrictions and/or lockdowns imposed that cause the most economic damage; while countries have vastly different reaction functions. The rub at this stage in the global recovery is that the economic, supply chain, and inflation backdrop is significantly changed relative to prior waves/variants. The pandemic has exposed instability in complex global supply chains; possibly ushering in a coming secular environment of pervasive supply shocks, vs. the demand shocks that were more commonplace for much of the past two decades. Expect more talk about companies switching from just-in-time inventory management to just-in-case. We all have to wait to see if the effects of omicron are significant; and whether they do more damage to demand, or exacerbate supply chain problems. What say you LEI? Without yet possessing more detailed analysis of the threat of omicron, we\\'re left with more traditional ways to judge the economic landscape for the coming year. As shown below, the Leading Economic Index (LEI), shows that the U.S. economy remains strong and well above the pre-pandemic high. The average span between LEI highs historically, and recession (gray bars) starts has been 12 months. While there is no sign of an imminent peak, a more serious economic threat wrought by omicron, or any number of other threats, could put a dent in leading indicators. LEI Not Yet Looking Back Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, The Conference Board, as of 10/31/2021. Consumers\\' strength being tested Consumer spending drives 70% of overall U.S. real GDP; with the metric of retail sales a proxy for consumption. As shown below, thanks to copious fiscal and monetary stimulus, consumer spending has been on fire; but with significantly different trajectories for goods and services consumption. The wholesale economic lockdown imposed in the spring/summer of 2020 led to an unprecedented divergence; while 2021\\'s reopening phase led to the start of a convergence. Virus trends hold a key to whether the convergence gets arrested. Goods/Services Divergence/Convergence Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 10/31/2021. One thing is for sure is that the future for certain pockets of goods consumption looks a bit bleak given elevated inflation. As shown below, buying intentions for large-ticket items, including vehicles, houses and household durables have imploded. Implosion in Buying Intentions Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 11/30/2021. The virus, and this year\\'s inflation surge, have also put a big dent in broader measures of consumer confidence. There is one consumer-based spread that bears watching heading into 2022, as it could represent the first heads-up for a possible recession. Consumers\\' confidence about their present situation has weakened, but there\\'s been an even greater deterioration in their expectations for the future; resulting in a historically wide spread between the two, as shown below (a consistent recession warning in the past). Consumers Less Optimistic About Future Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 11/30/2021. Labor market: headline strength, with confirmations still lingering Key to the 2022 outlook for the consumer, but also the broader economy and inflation, is the labor market. As shown below, total nonfarm payrolls have made a remarkable recovery since the trough in April 2020; but remain 4.2 million below the pre-pandemic peak. At the same time, the breadth of gains is lessened given the still-anemic labor force participation rate, which (as shown below) has moved sideways since August 2020 and is well below its pre-pandemic peak. While we think that the participation rate has room to increase in 2022—boosted by stronger business capital spending and a broadening out in job creation—the climb will likely be slow. Strong Payroll Recovery Not Matched by Strong Participation Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), as of 10/31/2021. Participation vs. resignation A slower improvement in participation is due to the unfortunate reality that, per the U.S. Census Bureau, 2.5 million individuals are still hesitant to re-enter the workforce because of the virus. Another large slate—estimated by the St. Louis Federal Reserve to be nearly 3 million—has retired early. Finally, a third cohort is reassessing their work/life balance. In the face of the omicron variant news, it\\'s clear that the virus will continue to be a factor in the trajectory of labor force participation. A major side effects of the pandemic continues to be workers\\' desires and newfound chances to change jobs. With that has come a delay in workforce re-entry and a subsequent strain on businesses\\' abilities to fill roles. This, along with early retirements, has culminated in what has been dubbed the \"Great Resignation.\" As shown below, job openings remain much higher than any pre-pandemic rate; while the quits rate recently hit a record 3%, signaling workers\\' confidence in finding better/higher-paying jobs. While we think both job openings and quits will remain elevated in 2022, current levels are likely unsustainable—especially if some pressure is eased by virtue of a rising labor force participation rate and net job creation. Power Back to the Worker Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 9/30/2021. The main benefit of elevated job openings and quits has been rising wages. As shown below, the median wage is increasing at annual rate of more than 4% per the Atlanta Fed\\'s wage tracker; with the lower end of the income spectrum experiencing the fastest wage gains. While we expect wage gains to remain firm, the best days for low earners may be nearing, especially as they continue to find jobs, effectively closing the gap, and as productivity (hopefully) improves. Wage Growth Wakes Up Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 10/31/2021. Atlanta Fed\\'s Wage Growth Tracker is a measure of the nominal wage growth of individuals. Inflation: putting the genie back in the bottle(neck) Strong wage growth is a key input for the hot inflation environment; and rampant uneasiness is justified, given the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is well above the five-year average of its annual change. That is the widest spread since 1980, as shown below. Inflation\\'s Sting Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 10/31/2021. Tying inflation to aforementioned trends in consumption, as shown below, core (ex-food/energy) goods inflation has by far been the primary driver of headline core inflation. That makes sense for several reasons: The world was effectively forced to shift spending to goods at the expense of services when the pandemic hit. Even as restrictions eased this year, goods demand didn\\'t fade markedly given the services sector faced rolling restrictions. Factory shutdowns in Asia (due to the spread of the delta variant) roiled supply chains, pushing goods prices up at an even faster rate. Inflation Remains Narrow for Now Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 10/31/2021. For those reasons, there has not yet been an equivalent surge in core services inflation, which contrasts with the hyperinflation of the 1970s and early-1980s. We believe services inflation has room to rise in 2022, but it could very well be curtailed by the omicron variant; while several forces could put downward pressure on goods prices: Reverse base effects: year-over-year changes in the first half of 2022 will be against 2021\\'s surge in prices, which could bring down CPI growth rates, especially if auto and hotel prices (culprits in 2021\\'s inflation surge) continue to drop. Supply side relief: freight shipping costs have rolled over, the number of containers sitting on docks has dropped, and factory production around the world is improving. Boomerang effect: companies\\' double-buying efforts to satisfy recent demand is resulting in a swift inventory rebuild, which could bring about an eventual supply glut and attendant cooling in prices. Mind the generation gap There are rampant fears of stagflation akin to the 1970s-1980s, but the good news for now is that unemployment is not on the rise. As shown below, the toxic mix of high inflation and a surge in the unemployment rate brought the economy to its knees starting in the 1970s. The combined rate—known as the Misery Index—climbed above 20% at the height of the 1970s\\' crisis, more than double the current rate. Rise in CPI Pushing Up Misery Index Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 10/31/2021. A major driver of 1970s\\' stagflation was persistently soaring unit labor costs, which weighed on companies\\' productivity and profit margins. As shown below, the spread between productivity and labor costs moved in lockstep with profit margins back then; but for now, margins are bucking the latest decline in productivity. Profit Margins Not Yet Dented by Higher Labor Costs Source: Charles Schwab, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Bloomberg, as of 9/30/2021. Some of that is attributable to globalization and the long-term decline in effective corporate tax rates, with which margins have become inversely correlated over the past couple decades. Yet, in the last year, the main driver of stronger margins was companies\\' slashing of both labor and capital during the depths of the pandemic. The faster-than-expected recovery in both demand and pricing power resulted in a goldilocks environment for fundamentals, thus delivering a solid foundation for stock market returns. We don\\'t expect productivity to continue its recent weakening trend relative to unit labor costs; but we also don\\'t think profit margins\\' current levels will persist in 2022. That should result in a relatively benign convergence for both series in the chart above. Key to watch will be whether we transition into a \"counter-cyclical\" inflationary environment, in which companies\\' pricing power would fade alongside consumer demand. We do know that the pandemic boosted productivity in certain economic segments, but also unleased a labor market mismatch; while massive stimulus arguably kept many \"zombie\" companies afloat. Also important to keep an eye on is whether inflation continues to affect business confidence. As shown below, inflation has been a relatively dormant issue for the past decade, but companies are now facing strains from higher prices and the inability to find skilled workers. An easing in supply chain pressures should help to alleviate costs, especially for small businesses. Inflation\\'s Surging Impact on Small Business Confidence Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), as of 10/31/2021. Throughout history, CPI increases of recent magnitudes were typically accompanied by weakness in the stock market. In the pandemic era, asset inflation preceded real economy inflation, with an attendant record-breaking surge in household net worth. The weight of the stock market in terms of the economy, as well as its influence on confidence, cannot be overstated. The next significant drop in asset prices could deliver an outsized hit to economic growth, as was the case in 2001. That year\\'s recession was a direct result of the bursting of the tech stock bubble in 2000. Tapering to pick up speed? Top of mind heading into 2022 is whether the Federal Reserve will speed up the pace of tapering. The Fed announced a pace of reduction of balance sheet additions of $15 billion per month ($10 billion of Treasuries and $5 billion of mortgage-backed securities), but only for November and December. The emergence of the omicron variant put downward pressure on yields, and a knee-jerk assumption of less tightening to come, with an expected three hikes by the end of 2022 shifting to only two. For now, the Fed plans to complete tapering before it begins hiking rates. Assuming no significant hit to economic activity from omicron, or a retreat in inflation pressures, we do expect the Fed to up the pace of tapering heading into 2022. Based on history, it\\'s not the timing of the first rate hike that matters, it\\'s the trajectory and speed once rate hikes begin. As shown below, in terms of the first year of Fed tightening cycles (middle field) stocks historically performed best under \"non cycles\" of rate hikes—when no more than two hikes were instituted, before the Fed halted. Stocks also had little trouble digesting \"slow\" rate hike cycles—when the Fed took a break by waiting at least one FOMC meeting in between each hike. Worst case for the market was during \"fast\" rate hike cycles—when the Fed hiked rates at most FOMC meetings. As shown in the left field, stocks typically did well in the year leading up to the initial rate hike. Source: ©Copyright 2021 Ned David Research, Inc.

A relationship that bears watching, and may help lay to rest the debate about whether inflation will turn out to be ultimately transitory, is between bond yields and stock prices. As shown below, for three decades starting in the late-1960s, they were mostly negatively correlated. That was an era punctuated by greater frequency of supply shocks, and an over-arching inflationary backdrop. For the two decades that followed, bond yields and stock prices were mostly positively correlated. This has been an era punctuated by a few demand shocks, but very few supply shocks; and an over-arching disinflationary backdrop.

A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, while a correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation. A correlation of zero means the assets are not correlated. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. After a brief dip into negative territory in mid-2021, the correlation is back in positive territory again. Any sustainable move back into negative territory could signal an inflation regime shift akin to what developed in the late-1960s; which ultimately led to significant policy errors in the 1970s. A policy error remains a risk for 2022; especially if stock market participants\\' optimism continues to be boosted by the (perhaps-erroneous) assumption that the Fed will always have the market\\'s back. This may be particularly relevant for the younger cohort of investors who have been \"educated\" about the stock market only during the pandemic era. Alerting to risks means we don\\'t get it? I was recently a guest on Scott Galloway\\'s very popular Prof G Podcast, and we chatted a bit on the younger cohort of retail traders. Scott has rightly been reinforcing that \"for their entire life, the market has gone up [and] if you say otherwise, you just don\\'t get it.\" Scott also noted something I experience quite frequently on Twitter: \"There is a surrender-to-the-narrative-or-else attitude online, and it\\'s really frightening, because if you say Bitcoin is overvalued, or Tesla is overvalued, or whatever popular SPAC is overvalued, these trolls in anonymous accounts come out of the woodwork and start attacking you.\" Narratives—even those bordering on the absurd—can push markets higher than fundamentals justify. At Schwab, we try to live in a world of fundamentals, data, investor sentiment and history; and spend less time focusing on pure narratives. Heading into 2022, what history says about valuations, earnings and sentiment is mixed-to-concerning. Earnings\\' fire becoming less hot in 2022 S&P 500 earnings have been on fire since mid-2020; with a sharp v-recovery into the second quarter peak. Earnings growth, although still strong in an absolute sense, is expected to descend through at least the first half of next year. As shown below, there is a close historical relationship between the growth rate in S&P 500 earnings and the year-over-year change in the index itself. This in and of itself isn\\'t a warning of impending doom; but is perhaps a message to curb your enthusiasm about future equity market returns remaining as robust as the pace of the past 20 months.

In addition, upward earnings revisions (by Wall Street\\'s analysts) have taken a turn for the worst, as shown below. This supports our view that companies bucking the broader trend and enjoying higher earnings revisions will continue to perform well relative to the overall market in 2022. It is in keeping with our view that the \"quality trade\" will persist as a general leader; with the low-quality/highly-speculative trades that dominated the start to 2021 remaining in the rear-view mirror.

Stocks expensive, unless using \"yields lens\" Earnings are a component of many popular valuation metrics. The \"heatmap\" below shows that most valuation metrics are well into the red (expensive) zone as we head into 2022; with the notable exception of those which measure valuation in the context of low bond yields. (Another take on this, however, is that bonds are expensive, which makes stocks look \"artificially\" cheap.) Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, The Leuthold Group, as of 10/31/2021.

Percentile ranking is shown from lowest in green to highest in red. A higher percentage indicates a higher rank/valuation relative to history. Honing in on the last row of the heatmap above, market cap/GDP is often referred to as the \"Buffett Indicator\" given it\\'s Warren Buffett\\'s oft-expressed favorite valuation metric. As shown below, never before in the post-WWII era have stocks been as richly valued relative to the size of the economy. This relates back to our concern that the next serious correction or bear market in stocks could have an outsized impact on both confidence and the economy. Buffett Indicator in Stratosphere Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 6/30/2021. Adding salt to that potential wound is the fact that U.S. households currently have more than 60% exposure to equities—about even with the prior peak in 2000, as shown below. It shouldn\\'t come as a surprise that the higher the equity allocation historically, the lower the subsequent long-term return. This doesn\\'t necessarily suggest impending doom for equities next year; but it\\'s a cautionary tale longer-term.

What to do I don\\'t manage portfolios, but I have much sympathy with what two investing legends have recently said. Leon Cooperman has been very vocal about being \"a fully invested bear;\" and Julian Robertson believes that \"trying to sell short in this market is like being run over by a train that\\'s going to derail a mile down the road.\" The environment that persisted in 2021 could persist in 2022. As shown below, for all the talk of a \"resilient market,\" under the surface, the churn in terms of drawdowns was significant. Rotational corrections are preferred over the bottom falling out all at once; but there is a risk that indexes, at some point, reflect more of the weakness that has persisted under the surface.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Macro backdrops that include slower growth, and a move from a loose to tighter monetary policy, tend to usher in higher intra-market correlations and greater tail risks. We continue to recommend a bias toward quality and not trying to time short-term sector rotations. For stock pickers, we believe factor-based investing makes more sense than simple sector-based (or traditional growth/value index-based) investing. In keeping with that, heading into 2022 we have nine out of 11 S&P sectors rated \"neutral\" with only one \"outperform\" (Healthcare, representing the best \"quality\" proxy) and only one \"underperform\" (Utilities, which represent an overvalued sector even though they still reside in value indexes). Readers are keenly aware of concerns we have about the investing landscape in 2022. But what should not (never) be inferred is that we suggest investors should be \"getting out.\" One of my oft-expressed mantras about investing is that neither \"get in\" nor \"get out\" is an investing strategy—that simply represents gambling on moments in time, while investing should always be a disciplined process over time. That discipline should involve diversification—across and within asset classes—and periodic rebalancing. Investors need to remain extremely alert to the risks of monetary policy, inflation, speculative froth, and ongoing virus concerns. But what ultimately matters is not what we know about the future; its what we do along the way.'}],\n",

       "   'content': 'It’s been a mixed bag for corporate bond investments this year. Investment-grade corporate bond returns have spent most of the year below zero, but riskier investments like high-yield bonds, bank loans, and preferred securities have not only posted positive returns, but have been some of the best-performing fixed income investments through mid-November. While the returns varied, there was one common denominator: Coupon income was the main driver of total returns, not price appreciation. We expect that trend to continue in 2022. Coupon payments have been a key driver of total returns this year Source: Bloomberg. Total returns from 12/31/2020 through 11/12/2021. Indexes represented are the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index (Investment Grade Corporates), Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index (High-Yield Corporates), and the ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index (Preferred Securities). Total returns assume reinvestment of interest and capital gains. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no indication of future results. The prospect of modest price declines doesn’t mean investors need to shun corporate bond investments as we approach the start of a new year, however. We suggest investors take a more cautious approach and not overweight any of the riskier parts of the market, while focusing on short- and intermediate-term maturities in the investment-grade corporate bond market to help limit the interest rate risk. Positive outlook, but less-easy monetary policies pose a risk We may sound like a broken record, but it’s important to point out that corporate fundamentals are strong. Corporate profits continue to rise, there are plenty of liquid assets on corporate balance sheets, and the number of corporate defaults has plummeted. Both Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s are projecting that the downtrend in defaults will continue, with Moody’s projecting a trailing 12-month speculative-grade default rate below 2% by the end of this year, a rate not seen since 2015. Given the strong fundamentals, the amount of bond upgrades by the rating agencies has dwarfed the number of downgrades this year. High-yield upgrades have significantly outnumbered downgrades this year Source: Bloomberg, as of 11/15/2021. Columns represent the percent of upgrades and downgrades as a percent of all rating actions from S&P for U.S high-yield issues. November rating actions are as of 11/15/2021. The slow withdrawal of easy monetary policies does pose a risk to the corporate bond markets—especially the riskier parts of the market like high-yield bonds and bank loans. Tighter financial conditions tend to lead to more volatility in the risky parts of the market and can potentially lead to price declines. The pace and magnitude of any Federal Reserve rate hikes will be important in 2022. If the Fed takes a patient approach to tighter policies, riskier bond investments may hold their value, but a faster pace of rate hikes could result in more volatility, wider credit spreads, and lower prices. Overall, this makes us a bit more cautious about lower-rated investments like high-yield bonds and bank loans, but investors can still consider them in moderation. More importantly, if rates rise in 2022 as we expect, it should provide investors an opportunity to lock in higher yields than they’ve seen in over a year. Below we’ll go over the various parts of the corporate market to highlight some areas of opportunity and some potential pitfalls. 2022 Corporate Bond Outlook Table 1 Asset Class Consider Asset Class Investment-grade corporates > Consider Maintaining a neutral allocation relative to strategic weightsReducing the average duration to \"below benchmark\" > Asset Class High-yield corporates > Consider Maintaining an allocation that\\'s in-line with your risk tolerance, but do not overweight That there\\'s a very little room for spreads to fall and prices to rise.

Investment-grade corporate bonds We suggest a neutral allocation to investment-grade corporate bonds, but favor a below-benchmark average duration. Over the past few decades the average duration of the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index has risen sharply, a trend that accelerated over the past few years. Duration is a measure of interest rate sensitivity—the higher duration, the more the bond or bond fund’s price will fall if its yield rises. A rule of thumb states that a bond’s price will fall by a magnitude of its duration (in percentage terms) for a given one percent rise in its yields. For example, if a bond has a duration of 5, and its yield rises—say, from 2% to 3%—then its price would theoretically fall by 5%. The average duration of the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index is now 8.7 which means that its price declines could be larger than the example above, and has been hovering near its all-time high of 8.9 for the past year and a half. That high interest rate sensitivity poses a risk to the broad corporate bond market given our expectation for the 10-year Treasury yield to rise to the 2% area next year. The average duration of the corporate bond index remains near its all-time high Source: Bloomberg, using weekly data as of 11/12/2021. Rather than a broad, index-tracking approach to investing in corporate bonds, we suggest investors focus on those with shorter maturities that are less vulnerable to rising bond yields. The 1-5 year corporate bond index offers a yield of 1.28%, up from just 0.65% at the beginning of the year. While that’s still low by historical standards, it’s higher than what investors can earn with very short-term investments like Treasury bills or money market funds, and it’s close to double the yield that an index of 1-5 year Treasuries offers. By investing in short-term corporate bonds, you can earn yields that are better than zero, while the low average duration helps mitigates the risk of rising yields. Short-term corporates offer higher yields than comparable Treasuries Source: Bloomberg, using weekly data as of 11/12/2021.

Investor takeaway: Consider investment-grade corporate bonds but be cognizant of the average duration of a given investment. For those who invest in individual bonds, focus on short- to intermediate-term maturities; we prefer the average duration of the bonds be less than the 8.7 average duration of the broad index.

For those who invest in individual bonds, focus on short- to intermediate-term maturities; we prefer the average duration of the bonds be less than the 8.7 average duration of the broad index. High-yield corporate bonds With an average yield of just above 4%, it’s tough to even describe the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index as being “high-yield.” Credit spreads—the amount of additional yield that corporate bonds offer above Treasuries with comparable maturities—remain near their post-financial-crisis lows. In other words, you’re not being compensated very well given their more aggressive risk profile. The average spread of the index is just 2.8%, a low not seen since the summer of 2007. In fact, going back to 2002, the average option-adjusted spread (OAS) of the high-yield bond index has been lower than the current level less than 3% of the time. Spreads remain near all-time lows Source: Bloomberg, using daily data as of 11/15/2021. Shaded areas represent recessions. Option-adjusted spreads are quoted as a fixed spread, or differential, over U.S. Treasury issues. OAS is a method used in calculating the relative value of a fixed income security containing an embedded option, such as a borrower\\'s option to prepay a loan. With spreads so low, total returns are likely to be relatively low going forward. There are two key components of high-yield bond total returns: coupon income and price appreciation or depreciation. Price appreciation is limited given the current level of yields. We expect Treasury yields of all maturities to rise modestly in 2022, and there is very little room for spreads to decline to offset that potential increase in yields. The average duration of the high-yield bond index is less than 4, significantly lower than that of the broad investment-grade bond index. If Treasury yields rise but spreads remain low, high-yield bond prices should hold their value better than the broad investment-grade corporate bond market. Over time, starting with such low credit spreads has made it a bit difficult for high-yield bonds to outperform Treasuries. And while corporate fundamentals remain strong today, we do see risks on the horizon. Inflation remains elevated, potentially eating into corporate profit margins if companies can’t pass on all of the price increases to their customers. The environment of supply chain bottlenecks poses a risk to the high-yield bond market since these firms tend to have riskier operations already, and any hit to their cash flows can make it more difficult to service their large debt loads. Finally, the prospect of less-easy monetary policies—but not policies that are necessarily “tight”—poses a risk to the junkiest parts of the market, as it can negatively affect their ability to get credit. As the Fed begins to slowly raise rates, that may result in a flatter slope of the yield curve. The yield curve today is still steep, with the difference between three-month Treasury bill yields and 10-year Treasury note yields sitting at roughly 160 basis points. But as that gap narrows, high-yield performance can suffer compared to Treasuries securities with similar maturities, as the table below illustrates. Next year we believe that the yield curve could go through bouts of steepening from time to time, but the long-term trend is likely a flatter yield curve. A flatter yield curve tends to coincide with lower total returns A flatter yield curve tends to coincide with lower total returns Starting Yield Curve Slope Average Next 52-Week Relative Return Less than zero -7.3% Between 0 and 100 basis points -1.1% Between 100 and 200 basis points 3.3% Above 200 basis points 8.2% Source: Bloomberg.

Make sure that any allocation matches up with your risk tolerance, goals, and objectives. Remember that high-yield bonds are aggressive investments. With spreads so low across the board, we suggest investors try to focus on the higher-rated parts of the high-yield market, limiting exposure to bonds rated “CCC”, in case the economic outlook deteriorates.

Preferred securities Preferred securities should be considered for income-oriented investors. Like the rest of the bond market, preferred securities’ yields are low, and prices are high. However, there are few options that can offer such high coupon payments. The average coupon rate of the ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index is 5.1%. Banks and other financial institutions represent a large majority of preferred securities issuance, and they appear to be in strong shape. The economy is growing, and the slope of the yield curve is still positive, allowing banks to borrow at low rates and lend at higher rates. The most recent results of the Federal Reserve’s stress test were released in June and showed that the largest financial institutions could handle shocks to the economy. Investors should brace for more volatility in 2022, however. So far, over the course of 2021, the average price of the index hovered between $104.2 and $108.1, the tightest trading range since 2015, but we don’t expect that trend to continue.1 If long-term yields rise as we expect and as the Federal Reserve policies become less easy, volatility may pick up and prices could edge lower. Just like with high-yield bonds, preferred securities tend to perform best when the yield curve is steep, so any flattening of the curve in 2022 could negatively impact preferred security prices and potential returns. Another risk is turnover at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Randal Quarles’ term as vice chair for supervision ended in October, and no one has been nominated to take that role yet (Quarles still holds a position on the Board of Governors but announced that he will resign in December). The outlook for bank supervision is now an unknown. If the new vice chair for supervision pushes tougher regulations on banks, that could affect their ability to make capital distributions to its common and preferred stockholders. All of this doesn’t mean you need to shed your preferred securities, though—just plan to hold them for a while to earn those higher income payments. Over a two-year investing horizon, preferred securities tend to generate positive total returns.

Bank loans Bank loans are a niche part of the bond market but can help investors looking for higher yields today. Because of their sub-investment-grade or “junk” ratings, they should always be considered aggressive investments. Given their aggressive risk profile, it’s often appropriate to compare bank loans to high-yield bonds, and today bank loans appear a bit more attractive. While they both have junk ratings, bank loans rank higher than high-yield bonds, and bank loans are backed by a pledge of the issuers’ assets. While that might not necessarily prevent a bank loan issuer from defaulting, it usually means that investors receive a higher recovery value in the event of a default. Finally, bank loans have floating coupon rates, which reduces their interest rate sensitivity. Adding it all up, bank loans have less credit risk and less interest rate risk than traditional high-yield corporate bonds, but investors aren’t sacrificing much in yield for those characteristics. The 4% average yield of the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index is just 10 basis points higher than the average yield of the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan 100 Index. Bank loan yields are just below high-yield bond yields today Source: Bloomberg, using weekly data as of 11/12/2021. S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index (SPBDLLY Index) and Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index (LF98TRUU Index). Note that the yield for bank loans is the weighted average yield and the yield for high-yield corporate bonds is the average yield-to-worst. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. There are risks, of course. Like most bond investments, there’s little room for bank loan prices to rise from here, as the $98.7 average price of the index is just 50 cents below its five-year high. And while both bank loans and high-yield bonds have junk ratings, the bank loan ratings mix is a bit riskier, with the loan market having more “B” and “CCC” rated issues, while more than half of the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Index is rated “BB.” Investor takeaway: Bank loans are worth consideration today and appear relatively attractive compared to traditional high-yield corporate bonds. Remember that they should always be considered aggressive investments. Individual bank loans are generally only available to large institutional investors, so bond mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tend to be the most appropriate way to gain exposure.

Money Market Funds- An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. Lower-rated securities are subject to greater credit risk, default risk, and liquidity risk. Preferred securities are often callable, meaning the issuing company may redeem the security at a certain price after a certain date. Such call features may affect yield. Preferred securities generally have lower credit ratings and a lower claim to assets than the issuer\\'s individual bonds. Like bonds, prices of preferred securities tend to move inversely with interest rates, so they are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Investment value will fluctuate, and preferred securities, when sold before maturity, may be worth more or less than original cost. Preferred securities are subject to various other risks including changes in interest rates and credit quality, default risks, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, deferral risk, corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Bank loans are typically below investment-grade credit quality and may be subject to more credit risk, including the risk of nonpayment of principal or interest. Most bank loans are floating rate, with interest rates that are tied to LIBOR or another short-term reference rate, so substantial increases in interest rates may make it more difficult for issuers to service their debt and cause an increase in loan defaults. Bank loans are typically secured by collateral posted by the issuer, or guarantees of its affiliates, the value of which may decline and be insufficient to cover repayment of the loan. Many loans are relatively illiquid or are subject to restrictions on resales, have delayed settlement periods, and may be difficult to value. Bank loans are also subject to maturity extension risk and prepayment risk. Source: Bloomberg Index Services Limited.

       "   'content': 'A high tide of growth, aided by a sea change in fiscal policy, is likely to help float the global economy safely over the rocks of risks in 2022, despite waves of worries emanating from COVID, inflation, shortages, and rate hikes. Illustration by Charlos Gary. © 2021 Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. Global GDP has surpassed its pre-pandemic level in 2021 and completed the transition from recovery to expansion, aided by strong policy support, the deployment of effective vaccines and the resumption of economic activities. In 2022, global GDP is anticipated to grow around 5%, forming the strongest back-to-back years for the world economy since the early 1970s. The likelihood of additional fiscal support in Europe, Japan, and the United States combined with the spending of pent-up savings by consumers and businesses supports global growth prospects. China’s policies in 2022 may offer targeted support for favored industries, allowing economic growth to slow only modestly. Although monetary policy may begin to tighten, the slow pace of withdrawal from pandemic-era policies may limit any negative impact on stock valuations. Inflation pressures are likely to ease over the course of the year; some of 2021’s shortages may turn into gluts by the second half of 2022. Historically, when global growth is above average, international stocks perform well, even when that growth rate is slowing, due to a high weighting in economically sensitive sectors. Above average global growth The pace of the global economic rebound may have peaked in 2021. Emergence from COVID lockdowns saw peak annualized growth rates for the U.S (6.7%) and U.K. (23.6%) in the second quarter, and the Eurozone (9.3%) in the third. Japan’s growth rate is anticipated by economists to rise to its fastest pace of the year at 4.1% in the final quarter of 2021. But not all countries have reached peak growth. In fact, only half of the world’s biggest 45 economies (accounting for 88% of the world economy) are expected to slow in 2022. Japan, Germany and Norway are expected to see growth accelerate in 2022 from 2021’s pace. Overall, world growth is expected to hit 4.9%, below the 5.9% pace in 2021 but well above the average rate of 3.0% over the past 50 years, according to IMF forecasts. The world hasn’t experienced back-to-back years of growth this strong in nearly 50 years. This helps provide a sizable cushion against the downside risks of inflation, supply problems, central bank rate hikes and COVID. Booming global growth to continue in 2022 Source: Charles Schwab, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development historical data with International Monetary Fund forecasts as of 11/17/2021. As COVID becomes endemic rather than pandemic, a seasonal surge in cases could lead to some new restrictions. Yet, each successive wave is likely to have diminished economic impact with hospitalization trends, rather than new case counts, becoming the hurdle for restrictions. Countries with higher vaccination rates could have reduced levels of hospitalizations, making restrictions shorter and more targeted at local outbreaks rather than nationwide. Sea change in fiscal policy While investors’ attention has been focused on the U.S. budget debate, a dramatic fiscal sea change has been taking place in Europe, in support of economic growth. Economic theory states that each incremental dollar spent by a government beyond what it collects should boost economic output by at least that amount. In the last global economic cycle, GDP growth in the Eurozone was slower than average, attributed largely to a policy of “austerity.” During this period, austerity was the word used to describe the tight budgets imposed to promote fiscal stability in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis. In this global economic cycle, as Europe emerged from the Great Lockdown, policymakers are taking the opposite approach and expanding budgets in a policy of abundance. Reviewing the early years of the last global economic cycle, 2011 through 2013, we can see that the primary budget balance in Europe swung from a deficit to a surplus. The governments of Europe increasingly took in more money than it spent, leaving the region a lonely outlier compared with the rest of the world, and resulting in a substantial drag on Europe’s growth. Current IMF forecasts for the years ahead stand in sharp contrast to the last cycle, estimating budget deficits in 2022 and beyond as government spending exceeds income and provides a tailwind to economic growth. Eurozone deficits forecast for the years ahead contrast with surpluses from 2012-19 Source: Charles Schwab, International Monetary Fund Fiscal Monitor October 2021. Estimates for 2021 and beyond are IMF forecasts. There are risks with running persistent deficits. The potential for rising interest rates may make the governments’ investment in the economy more costly to finance. A rise in the cost of borrowing could eventually curb spending. While rates have risen recently, the threat to budget deficits posed by interest rates remains reasonably low for the near-term. Eurozone bond yields are still negative in Germany and below 1% elsewhere, including Italy. Post-pandemic fiscal policy is likely to end up being a boost to growth rather than the drag it was following the Global Financial Crisis. Under the surface, there are rocky risks to this spending picture like COVID-19 making a meaningful resurgence, high inflation turning out to be permanent, or a changing attitude by the market towards ever rising government debt. For now, fiscal policies around the world are trending towards economic stimulus, supporting continued global economic expansion. Slow end to pandemic monetary policy Monetary policymakers are no longer signaling as much confidence that the rise in inflation will be quick to fade. But they have expressed views that tighter monetary policy may not be effective at taming the current drivers of inflation, which could prompt a softening of the labor market well before jobs return to pre-pandemic levels. Rather than risk acting prematurely, they are electing to wait and see, and take their time to unwind their unconventional pandemic-era policies. An increasing number of the world’s central banks are slowly beginning to raise interest rates. The blended central bank policy rate for the Group of 20 (G20) countries has started to creep higher and is now about a third of a percentage point above its low, although it remains very low on a historical basis, as you can see in the chart below. G20 policy rates on slow path higher Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 11/7/2021. Historically, when central banks were lifting rates from a low level (below average) as they are now, stocks in the MSCI World Index performed best (+10.3%). Conversely, it was when they were being cut from a high level (above average), global stocks performed the worst (-17.8%).

Annual performance of MSCI World Index for all years since 1997. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This performance makes sense. The economic and earnings environment is the primary driver of the stock market and central bank behavior. When the economy is strengthening after a downturn, central banks often lift rates from low levels seeking to normalize policy. When the economy is weakening, central banks are often cutting rates to support economic activity. For next year, global economic growth is expected to remain above average, and the rise in policy rates is likely to come amid a favorable growth backdrop for stocks. Fears of a gradual slowing of stimulus causing a major drop for the world’s stock markets seem unwarranted; the evidence suggests potential for a positive outcome. Inflation pressures to ease The supply shortages lifting inflation endured all year as strong demand outstripped supply, worsened by supply chain logjams. Fortunately, the globe may be past the worst of the supply chain logjam now that we are past the seasonal peak in shipping. The cost to ship a container unit on the world’s busiest route has fallen 30% from its peak in late September, although it may take some time for delivery times to return to normal. Rate to ship 40-foot container unit from Shanghai to Los Angeles in 2020 and 2021 Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 11/17/2021. After a year of supply shortages, the global economy may be closer to the end of the supply chain problems than the beginning. As a leading economic indicator, markets tend to look six-to-twelve months ahead; they may soon begin to consider the possibility that some shortages have started to ease and the potential for gluts in the second half of next year may have started to form. If supply gluts begin to emerge, manufacturing inputs like semiconductors and finished goods such as cars may see supply outrun demand, easing inflation pressures. Labor shortages have also contributed to global inflation concerns. Headlines touting big union pay demands and strike announcements may seem to echo the hyper-inflationary 1970s. Yet, these strikes are unlikely to reach the same intensity or have a similar impact on wages. Unions have been winning wage increases, but generally at lower levels than the country’s pace of inflation. Where wages are indexed to inflation, we are not seeing big increases. For example, the minimum wage increase was 1.6% in Spain and 2.2% in France. Although inflation pushed up some costs, corporate profit margins hit 10 year highs for both U.S. and international companies in the third quarter; companies have been largely successful at passing those costs on to customers. Stocks continued to move higher during the earnings reporting season, as results widely exceeded estimates. Despite rising costs, profit margins are at multi-year highs Source: Charles Schwab, Factset data as of 11/7/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Despite the recent inflation spike, long-term inflation expectations remain subdued. The market’s inflation expectations 5-to-10 years out are still at the low end of the range that prevailed between 2004 and 2014. In this global economic cycle, inflation may end up in a higher range than the last cycle, but about average on a longer-term historical basis. Emerging markets China’s economy dominates the emerging market landscape and could face domestic headwinds from a slowing property market, consumer caution in response to a zero-tolerance policy for COVID infections and the continued economic transition to achieve “common prosperity.” That said, the latest data shows the Chinese consumer isn’t worried about housing and prices for homes are still seeing price increases year-over-year despite a single month-over-month decline of -0.25% in October—a more dramatic decline or a string of declines could prompt a consumer pullback. Potential downside risks to growth could prompt the People’s Bank of China to add stimulus, even as other central banks are starting to tighten. China’s government is targeting makers of green technologies, semiconductors, and consumer brands with fiscal support almost as aggressively as they targeted overleveraged property developers, education companies and social media platforms with new regulation. As the 2021 regulatory tightening fades, the focus may shift to targeted easing, providing support to Chinese and emerging market stocks. While China may cut interest rates, most emerging market central banks have spent 2021 raising rates, ahead of developed market countries to tamp down their faster inflation and support their currencies against the rising U.S. dollar. If the more rapid pace of rate hikes continues throughout 2022, it risks tighter financial conditions in these markets which could slow growth from the IMF’s 5.1% GDP forecast for these emerging economies. Overall, these markets tend to be reliant on exports, and benefit when global growth is above average. Easing shipping logjams in supplies may boost emerging market stocks, but global supply gluts could impede export-reliant profits. Global investing themes in 2022 Economic growth is likely to slow in 2022 but remain at a historically rapid pace, supporting a solid earnings outlook. While equity valuations are not cheap, they are not at extreme levels. The MSCI EAFE Index (non-U.S. developed stocks) currently trades at 15.5-times forward earnings, as you can see in the chart below. Non-U.S. valuations mostly above average but not at extremes Source: Charles Schwab, Factset data as of 11/17/2021. In 2022, the favorable backdrop for global stocks may be accompanied by rising volatility as central banks begin to slowly hike rates. In closing, we highlight four themes for investors: Consider International – Stock markets outside the U.S. are more economically sensitive, contributing to their lag in the last economic cycle of 2009-2020, when global growth and inflation was below average. When global growth is above average (even when that growth rate is slowing) they tend to outperform, as you can see in the table below. Average annual total return of EAFE-USA (number of years) Average annual total return of EAFE-USA (number of years) World nominal GDP Above average Below average Accelerating 8.4% (15) 0.0% (10) Decelerating 1.4% (9) Period measured 1970-2020 using MSCI Indexes.

Go Green – Alternative energy and other green stocks could benefit from U.S., European, and Chinese climate and green energy legislation and spending, including electric vehicles, renewable power generation, eco-friendly infrastructure, and home energy efficiency. The massive green infrastructure spending plans from the U.S. Biden administration, the ambitious “Green Deal” by the European Union, and China’s proposal to improve on the impacts of economic growth through cleaner production, are all to be deployed in the years ahead. Green stocks go beyond merely alternative energy companies; the green infrastructure theme also includes traditional industries such as industrial machinery, electric utilities, semiconductors, and electrical equipment, among many others. Publicly traded companies in green infrastructure come from many developed and emerging market countries including the U.S., Spain, Denmark, Canada, New Zealand, China, Austria, Israel, Brazil, Norway, the U.K., and Germany. Look at Buybacks – Firms’ share buyback announcements appear to have been particularly good for share prices in 2021, as measured by the Solactive Buyback Indexes. These indexes track the performance of stocks whose management have announced plans to repurchase shares within the prior two months. In general, buybacks are seen by investors as a sign that a company has good cash flow and a strong balance sheet. These indicators are usually considered hallmarks of a high-quality company. Market trends can be fleeting, so it’s possible that the buyback theme could be short-lived. But, following the 2008-09 global recession, buybacks were a strong market theme for five years, outperforming the broad market during 2010-2014 in both the U.S. and in Europe. Guard against gluts – The risk theme of potential supply gluts could be something to watch out for in 2022. Shortages can cost companies growth opportunities, but gluts can negatively impact growth expectations as demand and prices fall. Keeping an eye on inventories can be crucial to determining when and where gluts may form.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Current low yields and tight spreads in the municipal bond market have made it difficult for investors to find opportunities to earn attractive interest income on their investments. We expect that to change in 2022. Our outlook for 2022 is that both spreads and yields should modestly increase. This may result in near-term price declines, but we expect there will be opportunities for higher yields. Portfolios that are appropriately positioned should benefit from the rise in spreads and yields over time (a spread is the difference in yield between two bonds of comparable maturity, and reflects the additional compensation investors require to own a security relative to a highly rated alternative, such as a U.S. Treasury bond). Early in 2021, there were concerns that the ongoing pandemic would create waves for the finances of some municipal issuers and lead to downgrades. That didn’t happen. Instead, Washington threw a life raft to the muni market. The economy also recovered much quicker and stronger than expected. As a result, credit concerns ebbed and prices on muni bonds didn’t fall as much as other fixed income sectors, resulting in munis outperforming most other highly rated fixed income sectors. Munis have performed relatively well so far in 2021 Source: Bloomberg, as of 11/17/21. Bloomberg High Yield Municipal Bond Index (\"High yield municipal bonds\"), Bloomberg US Treasury Inflation Notes Index (“TIPS”), Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High-Yield Bond Index (“High-yield corporate bonds”), S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (“Bank loans”), ICE BofA Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index (“Preferred securities”), Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index (“Municipal bonds”), Bloomberg Municipal Index Taxable Bonds (\"Taxable municipal bonds\"), Bloomberg U.S. Securitized: MBS/ABS/CMBS and Covered Index (“ Securitized bonds”), Bloomberg US Corporate Bond Index (\"Corporate bonds\"), Bloomberg US Agg Agency Index (“Agency bonds”), Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index (\"Core bonds\"), Bloomberg US Treasury Index (\"Treasury bonds”). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. We expect the supply-and-demand imbalance to ease in 2022 An imbalance between supply and demand is one of the reasons that munis have outperformed other fixed income asset classes this year.1 It is also a contributing factor to tight spreads and the riskier portions of the muni market outperforming those with less risk. As of November 17, flows into muni mutual funds and ETFs have been positive for 78 of the past 80 weeks according to the Investment Company Institute, signaling strong demand. Meanwhile, the supply of tax-exempt munis over the same period wasn’t nearly enough to meet the strong demand. This led to higher prices and tighter spreads. Demand for munis has been strong yet supply hasn’t kept pace Sources: Bloomberg and ICI, as of 11/17/21 The imbalance may ease because of a slowdown in demand. If interest rates rise, as we expect, the pace of fund flows should slow and may even turn negative. We’ve found that when returns are negative, historically fund flows turn negative shortly afterward. In other words, fund investors experience price declines and then begin to withdraw money from those funds. We expect interest rates to move higher next year as economic growth remains above its long-term trend and inflation remains elevated. We believe the 10-year Treasury yield could reach as high as 1.75% to 2.0% in 2022. Yields and prices move opposite one another, so if our expectation of higher rates comes to fruition, it could lead to near-term price declines. A glass half full A common metric to evaluate the relative attractiveness of the muni market is the municipals-over-bonds (MOB) spread. The MOB spread is a ratio of the yield on a AAA-rated muni relative to a Treasury bond of equal maturity before accounting for taxes. The MOB spreads for most maturities were historically low during most of 2021, especially for short-term maturities. This made it difficult for muni investors, because even after considering the effect of taxes, Treasuries and other highly rated investments often yielded more than munis, even for investors in the highest tax bracket. The MOB spreads are below historical averages Source: Bloomberg, as of 11/18/21. The chart is truncated at 175% for visual purposes. The 5-, 10-, and 30-year MOB spreads reached 650%, 365%, and 252% respectively on 3/23/20. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. If the supply-and-demand imbalance eases, as we expect it to do, MOB spreads should rise and yields for top-rated munis should move higher and closer to their longer-term averages. Spreads for lower-rated issuers should also rise, which would allow investors to achieve higher compensation for taking on credit risks. No big tax hikes may lead to higher yields To help pay for the Build Back Better spending package, Democrats originally had proposed increasing taxes on top earners, but as of this writing, many of those proposals were dropped. They could be added back in as negotiations move along but there is strong pushback against raising taxes. Among the original proposals were to increase the top tax rate to 39.6% from 37%, limit allowable deductions, levy a 3% surtax on individuals with an adjusted gross income above $5 million, and increase the top corporate tax rate to 26.5%. Municipal bonds generally pay interest income that is exempt from federal and potentially state income taxes. At higher tax rates, munis generally yield more than comparable taxable bonds like corporates or Treasuries. The muni market responded to the prospect of higher taxes with yields moving lower relative to taxable alternatives as illustrated by the change in the “breakeven” tax rate. The “breakeven” tax rate is the tax rate at which a municipal bond will yield more than a corporate bond before adjusting for taxes. As illustrated in the chart below, this rate is currently 47.1%, meaning if an investor’s combined tax rate (federal, state, local, and other applicable taxes) is above 47.5%, munis yield more than corporate bonds after taxes. The breakeven tax rate is near the highs over the past decade. Since taxes may not rise as much as originally proposed, we would expect muni yields to rise and the breakeven tax rate to fall. The breakeven tax rate is near 10-year highs Source: Bloomberg. As of 11/18/21 using weekly data. Bloomberg Municipal Bond 7 Year (6-8) Index and Bloomberg Intermediate Corporate Index. The “breakeven” rate is the tax rate that makes the after-tax yield for the corporate bond index equivalent to the yield for the municipal bond index. Concerns over credit should remain low We have a positive view of the credit quality for most muni issuers. The current economic recovery, as well as the substantial fiscal support, have helped to bolster revenues for many muni issuers. As an example, the 50-state total of rainy-day funds was estimated to be higher in fiscal year 2021 compared to the pre-pandemic high according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. The improvement in credit conditions is reflected in muni upgrades and downgrades. For the past two quarters, credit rating agency Moody’s has upgraded more bonds than it has downgraded. In addition, defaults are relatively low and mostly occurring in the riskier parts of the muni market, such as unrated issuers, land-secured deals, and health-care and hospital facilities. Muni defaults have been relatively low Source: Municipal Market Advisors, as of 11/17/21. 2021 is year-to-date as of 11/17/21. In 2022, we anticipate that credit conditions will remain favorable for most municipal issuers and defaults should continue to remain low. Revenues have surged, led by an increase in corporate and income taxes. Greater revenues allow issuers greater financial flexibility. Moreover, the improving property market should benefit local governments, as property taxes tend to be their largest source of revenues. Tax revenues have surged since Q4 2011 Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Quarterly Summary of State & Local Taxes, as of Q2 2021, which is the most recent data available. In addition to the improving revenue picture, funded levels for state pension plans are improving as well. According to projections by The Pew Charitable Trusts, “state retirement systems are now over 80% funded for the first time since 2008.” This is notable because an 80% funded level is considered to be fully funded. However, funded ratios vary by state, with some states like Illinois, New Jersey, and Kentucky largely lagging others. What to do now We expect 2022 to be characterized by some volatility but ultimately better investment opportunities than so far in 2021. We would suggest investors target a below-average duration, because bonds with lower durations typically experience smaller price declines to rising interest rates. A bond ladder strategy can be appropriate, because it can take the guesswork out of trying to time interest rates. Given our positive view of credit quality, we suggest that investors moderately add some lower-rated issuers to their portfolios. Valuations are more attractive in the lower-rated portion of the muni market. Although we think that it’s appropriate to add some lower-rated issuers, we would caution against adding too much as they are still prone to more volatility relative to higher-rated issuers. As a rough starting point, we would suggest putting no more than 40% of a muni portfolio in BBB/Baa and A/A rated issuers. That could be further broken down by 10% to 15% BBB/Baa and 25% to 30% A/A. Consider these weightings a rough starting point and deviate from them based on your own personal risk tolerance and needs. For reference, the Bloomberg Muni Bond Index, which is a commonly tracked index for the muni market, is 16% Aaa, 50% Aa, 26% A, and 9% Baa. 1 As of November 17, 2021.'},\n",

The more accounts you acquire, the more challenging it is to keep track of them all. Perhaps this is why there are some 24 million forgotten 401(k)s holding assets in excess of $1.3 trillion.1 Left unattended too long, old accounts can be converted to cash—and even transferred to the state as unclaimed property—forgoing their future growth potential. If you’re among those with misplaced savings, here’s how to locate and retrieve them: Find your funds: Ask previous employers whether they’re maintaining any accounts in your name. If the company no longer exists, contact the plan administrator. If you don’t know the name of the plan administrator, search the Department of Labor website for the company’s Form 5500, which will list its contact information. You might also check the state’s unclaimed property database via the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators. Take control: Once you’ve located your lost nest egg, you’ll likely want to consider either rolling it into your current employer’s 401(k), if permitted, or into an IRA, depending on their relative fees and investment choices. Ask your former and new plan administrators about how to handle the transfer on your be-half. If you take possession of the funds yourself, you have 60 days to deposit them into a qualified plan—otherwise the IRS could treat your transfer as a distribution, which will be taxed as ordinary income and may also trigger a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you’re not yet 59½. Think ahead The next time you switch jobs, be sure to have a plan for your retirement funds so you don’t lose track of them.

       "   'content': 'Estate planning is essential for those looking to pass down family wealth in an equitable, tax-efficient way. But one aspect many individuals overlook is the possibility that their assets could wind up in the hands of a child’s or grandchild’s ex-spouse. “It might feel mean-spirited to plan for the possibility of a divorce among your beneficiaries, but the reality is that a large percentage of marriages end that way,” says George Pennock, director of trust services consulting at Charles Schwab Trust Company. “That’s why it’s critical to think about not just what you’ll pass down to your heirs but how.” With that in mind, let’s look at ways to help ensure your assets go to—and stay with—their intended recipients. At-risk assets One of the easiest ways to transfer financial assets to heirs is via beneficiary designations, which bypass probate, the often lengthy and potentially expensive legal process used to settle an estate. (Transfer-on-death deeds offer similar benefits for real estate holdings.) However, even assets solely in your child’s name may be fair game in a divorce proceeding. “If such an asset is used as collateral for a shared loan or otherwise benefits both parties, a judge may consider it when determining alimony or child support,” George says. “That’s true even if the couple lives in the community property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.” Pre- and postnuptial agreements could help, but those looking to pass down assets may not feel comfortable requesting such a course of action from their heirs and their heirs’ soon-to-be spouses. Another way A carefully crafted trust can go a long way toward mitigating the risk that all or part of your assets end up in the wrong hands—particularly with estates that span multiple generations. “A lot of people focus on children, but they forget about grandchildren and whom they might marry,” George says. “A trust with the right provisions can give you greater control over who gets your assets and when.” It’s also important to consider the state in which you originate the trust and whose laws will therefore govern it. “You can establish a trust in any state, regardless of where you reside, provided your trustee, or trust administrator, is located there,” George says. “Trustee selection matters and can contribute significantly to the security and preservation of your legacy.” For example, Alaska, Nevada, South Dakota, and Tennessee allow courts to shield assets in a trust from claims that arise in divorce proceedings, including alimony and child support. However you choose to proceed, it’s essential to think through all potential scenarios with the help of an estate planning attorney. “An attorney can help ensure your heirs’ inheritances are protected for years to come,” George says.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I was able to build up my savings this past year, but with everything that’s going on in the world, I’ve been waiting to invest it. Is there an ideal time to get into the market? —A Reader Dear Reader, While I don’t share Scrooge’s negative sentiments about the holidays, when it comes to trying to find the perfect time to invest, I do find myself thinking: Bah! Humbug! Why? Because it’s been shown over and over again that trying to time the market is a bad idea. In fact, it could cost you—big time. With the dramatic market moves we’ve seen recently, I can appreciate your hesitation. But the most important considerations are your own goals, your appetite for risk, and how long you can afford to keep your money invested—not what the market is doing at any specific moment. So, if you have money to invest, I’d encourage you to steadfastly avoid trying to time the market. Here’s why. It’s about time—not timing Chances are slim that even the savviest among us will hit all the market highs and miss all the lows. Instead, the best way to improve your odds of success is to stay invested over time, no matter when you start. Take last year, for example. During 2020, the S&P 500® Index saw a total return of 18.4%. If you were invested during that volatile year, you’d have done pretty well. But if you’d sold when the market dropped, not only would you have locked in your losses, you’d also have potentially missed out on those trading days with the greatest gains, which would’ve meant even bigger losses. For instance, if you’d missed the top 10 trading days of 2020, you’d be down 32.9%. If you’d missed the top 40 days, you’d be down a whopping 61.8%! Staying power Remaining in the market during both the best and the worst trading days can lead to better returns. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data from Standard and Poor’s. Return data is annualized based on 252 trading days within a calendar year. The year begins on the first trading day in January and ends on the last trading day of December, and daily total returns are used. Returns assume reinvestment of dividends. When out of the market, cash is not invested. Market returns are represented by the S&P 500® Index’s 2020 returns. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs, or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. There’s no time like the present To me, nothing beats using numbers to make a point. So, here are a few more that may convince you not to wait any longer. Had you invested $2,000 in stocks annually for the past 20 years with absolute perfect timing—always buying low—you’d now have $174,535. However, even if you’d invested that same amount of money in stocks with the worst timing—always buying high—you’d have $140,895. Not so bad, right? Now here’s the clincher: If you’d kept that money in cash investments all those years, you’d now have only $64,124. So, whether your timing was good or bad, you’d still be way ahead by putting your money in the stock market. Take a lesson from Scrooge Ultimately, deciding when and how to invest isn’t so much about short-term market moves, it’s about you and your long-term goals. Investing in the stock market is a long-term proposition. Money you’ll need short term should be in more stable investments like cash, certificates of deposit, or short-term bonds. With money for longer-term goals like retirement or a child’s education, you can often afford to take on more risk because you have time to weather the market’s inevitable ups and downs. Again, it’s not about timing the market—it’s about giving yourself the time to reap the potential rewards while riding out the downturns. To make it even easier on yourself, you could put your investing on autopilot by automatically contributing a fixed amount or percentage at regular intervals (a strategy known as dollar-cost averaging), which can help take emotion out of your day-to-day decision-making. Of course, when times are uncertain, it’s easy to get spooked by the ghost of investing opportunities past or the specter of future losses. But take a lesson from Scrooge: To avoid regrets—past, present, and future—ask not what the market is doing at any given moment, but rather whether putting money in the market is the right strategy for you.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Some municipalities are more susceptible to weather-related risk than others. Here’s how to help weather-proof your muni portfolio.',\n",
       "   'content': 'If it seems like climate-related disasters are happening more often in the U.S., it’s because they are. From 2016 through 2020, the number of such events that caused a billion dollars or more in damage averaged 16.2 annually—compared with just 7.1 annually from 1980 through 2020, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (see “Under the weather,” below). As a result, municipal bond investors shouldn’t ignore the obvious: Natural disasters can have a financial impact on the municipalities in which they occur. Let’s take a look at how these disasters may affect muni-bond issuers, along with three steps investors can take to help protect their portfolios. Uneven effects The threat from climate-related disasters isn’t uniform across the entire $3.8 trillion muni market1—leaving municipalities that are prone to droughts, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires at risk of increased expenses, lower revenues, or both. And yields don’t appear to reflect such risks. For example, consider two similarly rated airport revenue bonds—issued by Miami-Dade County and the City and County of Denver—both maturing at least 30 years from now. The risk of a severe weather event over the next three decades is much greater for Miami than it is for Denver, yet the yield to maturity for the two bonds is nearly identical. In other words, investors in Miami munis aren’t being compensated for the region’s greater weather-related risk. Under the weather The number of billion-dollar weather events hit a record high in 2020. Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. How to respond For muni investors concerned about the potential impact of weather-related disasters, we suggest: Diversifying geographically: If you invest in individual muni bonds, we recommend holding those from at least 10 issuers with different risks, including geographic. As a reminder, we suggest that most investors diversify their holdings nationally—with the possible exception of those in high-tax states such as California and New York, for whom in-state munis exempt from federal, state, and local taxes are particularly valuable. Favoring higher-rated issuers: Issuers with sound finances generally have the flexibility to deal with surprises. New York City, for example, was able to maintain its AA credit rating in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, the fourth-costliest storm in U.S. history. New Orleans, on the other hand, was rated near the low end of the investment-grade spectrum even before Hurricane Katrina, the costliest storm on record, hit in 2005—and Standard & Poor’s subsequently downgraded the city’s general obligation (GO) bonds from BBB+ to a below-investment-grade rating of B. The city’s GO bonds eventually rebounded to a rating of A+, but they took eight years to do so.2 Opting for shorter-term bonds: Weather events may lead to outmigration, which can result in a smaller tax base. After Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, for example, the territory lost roughly 4% of its population to outmigration, pushing its population to a 40-year low.3 Focusing on short-term munis can help reduce this particular risk by limiting your exposure to potential population declines and other deteriorating conditions. Mix it up Overall, we recommend a mix of short- and intermediate-term munis to help ensure adequate diversification. However, we caution against lower-rated, longer-term munis in areas where weather shocks are more probable. 1Bloomberg, as of 09/07/2021. 2Bloomberg, as of 06/30/2021. 3Antonio Flores and Jens Manuel Krogstad, “Puerto Rico’s population declined sharply after hurricanes Maria and Irma,” pewresearch.org, 07/26/2019.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'You don’t need to be a finance expert to understand the logic behind stock buybacks. When a company repurchases its shares from investors, it reduces the available supply, thereby increasing both the relative value of each share and the earnings per share. Buybacks were one of the drivers of the remarkable 11-year bull run that followed the Great Recession, adding an estimated $4 trillion to the stock market between early 2009 and early 2020. Many companies suspended buybacks during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to conserve cash, but share repurchases in both the U.S. and Europe have been making a strong return in 2021 as the economic recovery accelerates. Could buybacks offer the same kind of lift to the stock market that they did after the last recession? Let’s take a closer look at recent buyback performance in the U.S. and Europe, as well as what to watch out for when assessing investments for your portfolio. The buyback boost When companies repurchase their own shares, it may signal to investors a confidence in cash flow and strategic direction—and that often translates into stronger returns. From February 2010 through December 2014, for example, the stocks of U.S. companies that bought back their shares returned an impressive 149%, whereas the S&P 500® Index returned 93%. In Europe, the difference was even more staggering: Buyback stocks returned 120%, whereas the STOXX Europe 600 Index returned just 35%. We’re seeing similar differentials during the current recovery. From November 2020 through June 2021, U.S. buyback stocks returned 48% versus the S&P 500’s 31%; in Europe, buyback stocks returned 45% versus the STOXX 600’s 32%. The buyback advantage Buyback stocks in both the U.S. and Europe have been outperforming their respective markets. Source: Charles Schwab and Bloomberg. Data from 10/30/2020 through 08/31/2021. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs, and expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. What’s more, companies on both sides of the Atlantic appear well positioned to maintain the current pace of buybacks well into next year—barring further setbacks in the fight against COVID-19 or a significant slowdown in economic activity—for three reasons: Companies are sitting on cash: Publicly traded companies in the U.S. and Europe were sitting on nearly $2.9 trillion earlier this year. As a result, businesses have plenty of leeway to buy back their shares even as they invest in their businesses to meet demand and address supply bottlenecks. Earnings are strong: S&P 500 companies grew their earnings 96% year over year through the second quarter of 2021. The picture was even stronger in Europe, where earnings grew 153% during the same period. Stimulus is ongoing: There’s some government funding still in the pipelines in both the U.S. and Europe, which should provide further support for cash flows and earnings. See more Onward articles. Go to Onward hub Before you buy Whether a company you own recently announced a plan to repurchase shares or you’re looking to buy the buyback trend, consider some important questions: Does the company have strong fundamentals? Businesses should be investing in their futures at adequate levels—otherwise, they could be using buybacks to mask weakening fundamentals and keep their share prices afloat. For example, high-growth companies in the technology sector generally should be redeploying cash into operations, where they can earn a higher return and remain competitive. If they’re instead repurchasing shares, it could be cause for concern. Is the company likely to follow through? Companies sometimes announce a buyback but then fail to fulfill it, whether in whole or in part. Often this happens when new priorities arise or a crisis hits. Generally speaking, companies with a long-term history of share repurchases are more likely to follow through on them. Is the company issuing new shares? Companies can simultaneously repurchase their shares and issue new ones, which sometimes happens when executives exercise their stock options. This dilutes the benefit of the buyback program, since the shares outstanding may not decline at all, and could even rise depending on the pace of buying and issuing. You can check for net declines or increases in a company’s shares outstanding on its balance sheet at the close of each quarter. If researching individual stocks feels daunting, or if you want to reduce the influence a single buyback stock has on your portfolio, you might consider buyback-focused exchange-traded funds or mutual funds. Adding a fund focused on U.S. buybacks and another focused abroad will help spread your risk and reduce your exposure to single sectors and markets.'}],\n",

       "   'abstract': 'How to successfully transfer your business to a new owner.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Every business starts out as somebody’s baby—which is why stepping away can be so difficult. But the only thing more daunting than coming up with a succession plan is doing so on short notice. Having helped countless business owners, I’ve seen firsthand the high costs of deferred or inadequate succession planning. Some owners may assume an heir is interested in taking over the business, only to find out too late that he or she has no such desire. Others might believe their business is worth more than it actually is, which can make selling difficult, if not impossible. In short, successfully transferring your business to a new owner takes a pragmatic and proactive approach. Although it’s never too early to begin planning how to divest from your business, at least five years before a planned sale or transfer is best, allowing you time to consult with heirs and possibly restructure. With that said, here’s what to consider as you get started. Valuing the business Whether you’re gifting or selling the business, you’ll need to assess its value. Owners who are emotionally attached to their business may have a difficult time doing this objectively, so it’s wise to work with a qualified business appraiser who can help determine not only an appropriate valuation but also the proper metric by which to measure it. The three most common methods of valuation are: Cost-based, which estimates a business’s value by subtracting the fair-market value of its liabilities from its assets Income-based, which estimates a business’s value according to its cash flow Market-based, which estimates a business’s value by looking at comparable companies The American Society of Appraisers, a good accountant, or an attorney should be able to refer you to an appraiser specializing in your area of business. Industry associations can also help. Once you have an appropriate valuation, it’s time to weigh which of three common methods is the best option for transferring ownership of your business. See more Onward articles. Go to Onward hub 1. Gift it to heirs Many owners dream of their kids taking over the family business—but while some heirs will jump at the opportunity, others won’t. Still others may want to quickly sell their stakes, which can put the business at risk. The family successions that tend to work best involve children either starting at the bottom or working outside the firm to prove their mettle as potential entrepreneurs. According to consulting firm Deloitte, only 30% of family-owned businesses survive into the second generation, 12% into the third, and 3% or less beyond that,1 so it’s critical to start your succession planning with a frank assessment of who has both the desire and the aptitude to take the reins. You may ultimately decide to exclude one or more heirs from the company, in which case you might want to compensate them in some other way in your estate plan. Finally, you’ll want to consider the tax ramifications of passing on the business. Individuals can currently give away up to $11.7 million ($23.4 million for married couples) without triggering gift or estate tax. But if the combined value of your business and your estate surpasses this amount, the taxes are steep: up to 40% of the amount that exceeds the limit. 2. Sell to family or a colleague If you can’t afford to gift the business to your heirs, you could sell it to them instead. One common hurdle is that heirs may lack the capital to purchase the business outright, in which case a seller-financed installment note might be a viable solution. Instead of paying you a lump sum, the buyer would send you fixed regular payments over a set number of years, similar to a mortgage. For example, if your business is valued at $4 million, you could establish an installment note in which the buyer agrees to pay you $200,000 plus interest annually for 20 years. The note’s regular payments can make the purchase more manageable for the buyer and provide steady income for you. Plus, if you sold the business for a gain, receiving payments in increments can help spread your tax liability over several years. If selling to heirs isn’t a viable option, selling to co-owners or key employees can make for smooth handovers. Some owners even spend years laying the groundwork, slowly offloading duties to others so clients won’t notice a transition. If your business partner or employees lack financing, an installment note could be a solution here, as well. Just make sure the buyer can keep the business going long enough to repay you. 3. Sell to a third party This option is perhaps best suited to more turnkey operations, like a restaurant or retail shop, rather than a business that’s reliant on the owner’s unique brand or expertise. But selling to an outsider can be complex—typically requiring lengthy negotiations and potentially triggering significant taxes—so many owners opt to work with a team of specialists, including a broker who can identify the strongest buyers and a tax attorney who can help plan for the tax consequences of a profitable sale. What’s next? By constructing a succession plan alongside a retirement plan, you can not only make sure your cash flow needs are met but also think about what will give your life meaning after you’ve handed over the reins. Will you keep a hand in the business, or move on to the next stage in life? Planning well and early can make it easier to find the option that’s right for you. 1Business succession planning: Cultivating enduring value, deloitte.com, 2015.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Four common types of news releases—and how to consider trading them.',\n",
       "   'content': 'There’s no shortage of financial news, to say nothing of the reaction to it. But how should you trade in response to such information? Let’s look at the four most common types of “news” moving the markets today and how you could position your trades to ride the ripple effects. 1. Corporate earnings The release: Quarterly earnings reports can trigger some of the most volatile—and potentially profitable—periods for trading a company’s stock. The key here is usually how the numbers compare with analysts’ expectations. However, many companies appear to be conservative in their estimates ahead of their releases, which can often lead them to exceed expectations. In fact, in the first quarter of 2021, 86% of S&P 500® Index companies reported better-than-expected earnings, according to the financial research firm FactSet. The response: Consider waiting to trade on earnings until after the company-hosted call, during which officials may talk about the underlying health of the business, revise their outlook for future earnings, or reveal other data not made available in the earnings release. For example, when social media giant Twitter posted better-than-expected first quarter earnings in April 2021, its stock still plunged more than 15% after its forward-looking guidance fell short of expectations (see “Sudden drop,” below). Sudden drop Traders who tried to get ahead of Twitter’s earnings announcement (E) on April 29 may have suffered significant losses when the company’s less rosy revenue outlook caused the stock to plummet in after-hours trading. Source: schwab.com with data from 04/01/2021 through 06/01/2021. Examples provided are for illustrative purposes only and not intended to be reflective of results you can expect to achieve. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 2. Economic data The release: U.S. government agencies periodically report various data on the health of the economy. Generally speaking, the most tradable are: Weekly initial jobless claims Monthly Consumer Price Index data Monthly retail sales figures Monthly jobs report Quarterly gross domestic product estimates The response: Again, be mindful of expectations when trading in response to economic data. Many news sites report economists’ consensus outlook ahead of time, and the market will often move—at least initially—based on whether the numbers are better or worse than the median estimates. However, sentiment can change once investors have had a chance to dig into the details, so beware of trading on the data too soon. 3. Fed announcements The release: Tracking the Federal Reserve and the direction of monetary policy isn’t just about trading on rate hikes or cuts. While those decisions—made by the Fed’s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)—are important, they are often widely telegraphed by Fed officials ahead of time. What’s most influential is the FOMC’s forecast for interest rates and other policies moving forward. The response: Traders should keep an eye on the statement that accompanies the Fed’s rate decision after each of its eight scheduled meetings every year; even slight changes in wording from meeting to meeting can lead to significant market moves. Similarly, changes to the Fed’s dot plot—which represents the view of each voting member for the federal funds rate target range—can influence stock prices. Traders also should look for changes in tone when Fed Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after each FOMC meeting. Following the June 2021 meeting, for example, stocks fell after Powell said Fed officials were “talking about talking about” tapering—a reference to a potential slowdown in the pace of the central bank’s monthly bond purchases since the pandemic began. 4. Federal fiscal policy changes The release: Unscheduled policy announcements can have a dramatic impact on stock prices. Unfortunately, by the time actual legislation is approved—if it’s approved at all—it’s usually already baked into valuations. The Biden administration’s $2 trillion infrastructure proposal, for example, helped boost industrials in the first half of 2021, but subsequent compromises reduced the scope of the proposal—and with it, investor enthusiasm for the sector. The response: Those looking to capitalize on potential policy shifts should heed the adage, “Buy the rumor, sell the news.” That is, consider entering a trade around the time the policy is announced—when expectations are often at their peak—and exiting before that blue-sky proposal is inevitably brought down to earth. General rules of the road In addition to the tips above, it can be helpful to try the following tactics: Narrow your time horizon: In most cases, you’ll want to get in and out of trades within a few days or even a few hours, lest other price-moving developments derail your original thesis. Protect your downside: Whenever you take on a new position, consider entering a stop or stop-limit order that indicates how far you’re willing to let a stock slip before you sell. While these risk-management tools won’t protect you from after-hours or premarket moves, they can help mitigate the damage if a trade moves against you during the day. Limit your exposure: Many traders restrict their shorter-term trading positions to no more than 20% of their total portfolio—with no more than 5% wrapped up in any one trade. Go broad: Consider exchange-traded funds, which grant you access to large or small swaths of the market; in some cases, they’ll even allow you to short parts of the market if you expect bad news. And remember: Letting a little time elapse after news breaks can bring clarity—and even a complete reversal in an individual stock or the broader market—so don’t jump the gun if you aren’t feeling confident in your reading of the latest news.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'In 2004, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra propelled hundred-foot walls of water toward the shores of India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. The so-called Boxing Day Tsunami claimed nearly 230,000 lives, decimated entire cities, and caused an estimated $10 billion in damages.1 It was one of the deadliest natural disasters of the past century. In the months that followed, U.S. donors sent an estimated $3.16 billion in charitable contributions to the region.2 More recent international tragedies—such as the earthquakes in Haiti, the crisis in Afghanistan, and the wildfires in Australia—have inspired similar or even larger outpourings of generosity, making international affairs one of the fastest-growing charitable sectors over the past two decades (see “Altruism abroad,” below). “It’s difficult to watch crises unfolding abroad and not want to help,” says Sam Kang, president of Schwab Charitable™. But supporting international causes isn’t always as straightforward or transparent as domestic giving. “If you want to give directly to an overseas charity, there are lots of hoops to jump through lest you run afoul of government regulations in that country or IRS guidelines,” Sam says. Altruism abroad Charitable support for international causes has more than tripled since 2000. Source: Giving USA. All figures in 2020 dollars. | *Percent change for “Gifts to individuals” sector from 2005 through 2020. With that in mind, let’s look at three methods for supporting international charities. 1. Granting to U.S. charities with global reach You don’t have to give directly to an international organization to make an impact abroad. Thousands of U.S.-based charities have global missions, including such household names as the American Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders (a.k.a. Médecins Sans Frontières), and the International Rescue Committee. “It’s generally much easier to determine the reputability of a U.S.-based charity than a foreign one,” Sam says. “Working with a familiar or trusted U.S.-based charity, in particular, can help allay some of those concerns.” It’s also easier to determine the tax status of U.S.-based charities. “But not all gifts to U.S. organizations are tax-deductible, so be sure to confirm before donating,” Sam says. With the assistance of tools like Charity Navigator and GuideStar, you can research program descriptions, financial reports, and other information to help identify the organizations best suited to your charitable goals. Many donor-advised funds (DAFs), including Schwab Charitable, offer additional resources to help you further narrow your search. And when you give via a DAF, your contributions can be invested for potential tax-free growth so you can maximize your charitable impact. 2. Giving directly to foreign charities If your goal is to target specific populations or programs with your giving, you may wish to work with local organizations that can funnel your funds directly to those in need. However, finding a reputable foreign charity can prove challenging. For one, donors must ensure they’re not supporting organizations that are on U.S. fraud, sanctions, or terrorist lists. The Office of Foreign Assets Control maintains a database of prohibited entities. Donors looking for income tax deductions on their gifts should also be certain the foreign charity satisfies IRS guidelines for international grant-making. You can search for tax-exempt foreign charities on the IRS website. If a charity isn’t on the list, it must be vetted in one of two ways: Equivalency determination (ED), in which an attorney determines whether the international organization is the legal equivalent of a U.S. charity based on a review of the organization’s charter and other documentation. Expenditure responsibility (ER), in which the grantor conducts a pre-grant inquiry—similar to the ED process—to ensure the recipient is able to fulfill the charitable purpose of the grant, and then monitors and reports the grant’s progress to the IRS. “The ED and ER processes generally are too onerous for individuals to manage themselves, making it difficult to give directly to some international charities in a tax-smart way,” Sam says. “In such cases, giving via a DAF can be an attractive alternative.” Schwab Charitable, for example, can help identify qualifying foreign charities in line with your goals and do the heavy lifting of an equivalency determination through its Direct Global Giving Program. See more Onward articles. Go to Onward hub 3. Working with an intermediary If you don’t have the time or interest necessary to vet and monitor foreign charities but want to be sure your donations go directly to the communities you’re aiming to support, consider working with intermediary organizations, which offer strategic guidance and make grants to local groups on donors’ behalf. “For a processing fee, these organizations’ expert local staff review the nonprofit organizations for suitability, ensure gifts are disbursed as donors intend, and monitor projects firsthand for effectiveness,” Sam says. “And if the recipient of your grant requires an ED or ER review, the intermediary will handle that process on your behalf.” For example, a donor interested in supporting women’s education abroad might engage an intermediary to help identify reputable organizations making a meaningful impact in their communities. Once the donor settles on an organization to support, he or she donates to the intermediary, who then regrants those funds to the local charity. After the funds are distributed, the intermediary monitors the charity’s impact to ensure donation dollars are being used effectively. “When you give via Schwab Charitable, you have access to a network of vetted international intermediaries that are local to their areas of expertise and can perform a review of selected charitable organizations and projects,” Sam says. Start with a plan As with most aspects of your finances, creating a plan can help ensure your charitable dollars have the greatest impact. “When you start with a plan, you’re able to take the time and care to identify the right charitable methods and organizations—as well as get ahead of any legal or tax hurdles,” Sam says. 1National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 2“Americans Donated More Than $3 Billion to Tsunami Relief Efforts, Study Finds,” philanthropynewsdigest.org, 12/26/2006.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Strategically selling your winning investments could reduce current and future taxes.',\n",
       "   'content': 'If you have winners in your portfolio, conventional wisdom says to delay collecting your capital gains as long as possible. Doing so allows you to defer paying capital gains taxes—plus, waiting could reduce the amount of tax you ultimately owe if you find yourself in a lower bracket when you do sell. However, conventional wisdom can sometimes be wrong: By selling some of your winners, you could actually help reduce future taxes and create a more balanced portfolio—a strategy known as tax-gain harvesting. How it works: Tax-gain harvesting offers investors the opportunity to realize long-term capital gains with little or no impact to their taxes. Here are three situations in which it may be an applicable strategy. 1. You fall into a lower tax bracket this year If your pay fluctuates from year to year—which may be the case if you\\'re self-employed, on sabbatical, or work part-time—a lean year could provide an opportunity to realize tax-free long-term gains. Individuals who have taxable income of less than $40,400 ($80,800 for married couples) in 2021 fall into the 0% long-term capital gains tax bracket (LTCG). In this situation, you would look to realize just enough long-term capital gains to stay within the 0% tax bracket. For example, if you\\'re married and your combined taxable income for 2021 is $72,000—wages of $97,100 less the $25,100 standard deduction—you could realize up to $8,000 in long-term gains at the 0% rate. Note that this applies only to long-term capital gains; short-term gains on assets held one year or less are taxed as ordinary income. This example is hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. 2. You want to offset losses Even if you have an income that pushes you into a higher long-term capital gains tax bracket, you can still utilize tax-gain harvesting. For example, if you\\'ve realized capital losses this year, consider realizing the commensurate amount of capital gains. The losses effectively zero out the gains, likely eliminating the capital gains taxes that might otherwise be due. Similarly, if you don\\'t immediately need the proceeds from the sale, you could consider repurchasing the same stock to reset the investment\\'s cost basis. That way, you would pay no tax on the current gain—and any realized capital gain in the future would be based on the new, higher cost basis. That said, if you repurchase the same stock, be aware that each and every share needs to be sold for a gain or else the wash-sale rule could apply (see \"Beware the wash-sale rule,\" below). Tax-gain harvesting in action Selling an investment for a gain and resetting its cost basis can help you save on taxes. Let\\'s look at an example of how tax-gain harvesting works, using the same married couple as before, with $72,000 of taxable ordinary income. Say they also own XYZ stock, which they purchased for $5,000 several years ago and they plan on selling that stock when it hits $15,000, at which point their likely to be in the 15% LTCG tax bracket. They have two options: This example is hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. 3. You\\'re looking to reduce concentrated positions Sometimes your winning positions can throw off your portfolio\\'s target asset allocation, due to one set of stock raising faster than another. For example, say your tech stocks are doing better than your energy stocks, that could leave you overexposed to volatility in the tech sector and expose you to more market risk than you\\'d intended. Look for opportunities to bring your portfolio back to its target allocation by selling some winners—ideally along with some losers to help soften the tax hit—and using the proceeds to rebalance your portfolio. Other considerations Tax-gain harvesting can only be done in a taxable account, like a brokerage account. Also, recognizing a net capital gain could impact other tax calculations that look at your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), such as the taxation of Social Security benefits. Finally, unlike tax-loss harvesting, which can be done year-round, tax-gain harvesting is best implemented at year end, when your total income and losses can be better estimated. That way, you can be sure you’ll indeed qualify for the 0% long-term capital gains tax rate or that you have enough capital losses to offset the realized gains. The bottom line By strategically harvesting gains in certain tax years, you can potentially reduce your tax liability and keep your portfolio in balance. Be sure to consult your financial advisor and tax professional to implement a strategy that works for your situation. Beware the wash-sale rule A wash sale occurs when you sell a security at a loss and then purchase the same or \"substantially identical\" security 30 days before or after the sale date. In tax-loss harvesting, investors need to avoid wash sales, or the harvested loss won\\'t be allowed as a deduction. In tax-gain harvesting, however, the wash-sale rule doesn\\'t apply if the investor sells every share for a gain and none at a loss. Under that scenario, the investor can immediately repurchase the exact same investment.

       "   'abstract': 'Increase your giving power while potentially minimizing your tax liability.',\n",
       "   'content': 'One silver lining to come out of the pandemic has been the significant increase in giving to support those impacted the most. According to Giving USA, charitable giving in the U.S. reached a record $471.44 billion in 2020, up 5.1% from 2019.1 As of June 2021, charitable giving has nudged even higher with a 6.1% increase over the prior 12 months.2 As the giving season approaches, consider these four ways to maximize your giving power while potentially minimizing your tax liability. 1. Give appreciated non-cash assets instead of cash Aside from generosity, the upward trend in charitable giving can be traced to economic factors, including growth of the S&P 500® index. With the S&P 500 roughly doubling between 2016 and 2021, many investors have highly appreciated non-cash assets—such as publicly traded securities, restricted stock, real estate investments, and private business interests—in their portfolios. Before you sell appreciated non-cash assets to donate the proceeds, consider contributing the assets instead. If you\\'ve held the assets for more than one year, you could possibly increase your gift as well as your tax savings. Gifting the assets generally eliminates the capital gains tax you would incur from selling them—allowing you to potentially donate up to 20% more and, thereby, lowering your tax liability. Let\\'s take a look at how this strategy would work if you owned stock XYZ with a current value of $50,000. Donating stock assets vs. after-tax sale proceeds This hypothetical example is only for illustrative purposes. The example does not take into account any state or local taxes or the Medicare net investment income surtax. The tax savings shown is the tax deduction, multiplied by the donor’s income tax rate (24% in this example), minus the long-term capital gains taxes paid. If you decide to sell XYZ stock, with an original cost basis of $5,000 and a 15% capital gains tax rate, your charitable gift would be $43,250 after paying a long-term capital gains tax of $6,750 (($50,000 – $5,000) x 15%). Assuming your tax rate is 24%, your tax savings would be $3,630 (($43,250 x 24%) – $6,750). By donating XYZ stock instead, you wouldn\\'t pay the long-term capital gains tax, allowing you to gift the full $50,000 value—a tax savings of $12,000 ($50,000 x 24%). With this strategy, the charity would receive the $6,750 that you would\\'ve owed on long-term capital gains tax—a win-win situation for both the charity and you. 2. Bunch charitable contributions With 2022 standard deduction limits expected to increase from current levels,3 itemizing deductions may be more trouble than it\\'s worth. If your total itemized deductions fall short of the standard deduction, you could benefit from consolidating two years\\' worth of giving into one. For instance, let\\'s say you decide to bunch, or combine, your 2021 and 2022 charitable contributions into one year (2021). You would then itemize deductions on your 2021 tax return and take the standard deduction in 2022. In addition to achieving a large charitable impact in 2021, this strategy could produce a larger two-year deduction compared to two separate years of itemized deductions, depending on your income level, tax filing status, and giving amounts each year. Here\\'s an example of how a married couple with no children could claim an additional $8,200 in tax deductions by bunching their annual contributions of $10,000 for both 2020 and 2021 on their 2020 tax return. Taking the standard deduction vs. bunch giving This hypothetical example is for illustrative purposes only. In this scenario, the couple averages $10,000 in charitable deductions and $13,000 of other deductions (a total of $23,000) each year. With Option 1, the couple chooses to take the higher standard deduction amounts of $24,800 in 2020 and $25,100 in 2021—a two-year total of $49,900. The alternative is to bunch their charitable giving for 2020 and 2021 so that they donate $20,000 in 2020 and nothing in 2021. They could then claim $33,000 in itemized deductions in 2020 and the standard deduction of $25,100 in 2021 for a two-year total of $58,100—$8,200 more than if they had taken the standard deduction both years. If you had bunched two or more years of contributions for 2020 and plan to take the standard deduction for 2021, you may also consider taking the special CARES Act deduction ($300 for single filers and $600 for married couples) for cash donations made to operating charities4 in 2021. Alternatively, if you itemize deductions and wish to achieve a large charitable impact in 2021, you may choose to give beyond your normal annual adjusted gross income (AGI) deduction limits. Then, you can carry over the excess amounts up to five tax years.5 Keep in mind that if you want a 2021 tax deduction, your gift must be received and processed by December 31, 2021, and some non-cash assets require additional processing time. 3. Give more by donating retirement assets If you\\'re in or near retirement or are reviewing your estate plan, you might consider these three tax-smart tips to help maximize your charitable impact this year as part of your overall legacy planning. Make a Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD) of individual retirement account (IRA) assets. If you\\'re age 70½ and older, you can direct up to $100,000 per year tax-free from your IRAs to operating charities through QCDs—regardless of whether you itemize deductions or claim the standard deduction. By decreasing the IRA balance, a QCD may also reduce your taxable income in future years, lower your taxable estate, and limit your IRA beneficiaries\\' tax liability. QCD requests generally should be initiated by early December at the latest to ensure processing is complete before the end of the year. Use a charitable deduction to help offset the tax liability of a retirement account withdrawal. This strategy may be used if you are over age 59½ (to avoid an early withdrawal penalty) and will itemize deductions for 2021. As with the above strategy, a withdrawal offers the additional benefits of potentially reducing your taxable estate and limiting tax liability for account beneficiaries. Convert retirement accounts to Roth IRAs. If you itemize deductions and have tax-deferred retirement accounts, such as a traditional IRA, you can use charitable deductions to help offset the tax liability on the amount converted to a Roth IRA. The primary benefits of a Roth IRA are earnings can potentially grow tax free, qualified withdrawals are tax free if holding period and age requirements are met, you\\'ll have no annual required minimum distribution, and the tax liability for beneficiaries is eliminated (depending on the timing). Be sure to talk with a tax professional or financial advisor before deciding to do a Roth IRA conversion. 4. Recommend recurring grants for unrestricted use Predictable and steady streams of revenue help charities solidify their finances and effectively plan and deliver their services, especially during difficult times. You can provide ongoing revenue through a series of recurring grants awarded indefinitely or over a defined period of time through a donor-advised fund. A donor-advised fund is an investment account administered by a charitable sponsor that is used solely for charitable giving. You receive a tax deduction for the year that you contribute cash, appreciated assets, or investments to your account.6 However, the CARES Act incentives mentioned earlier won\\'t apply. Fund assets may be invested in investment pools or managed by an investment advisor, and your earnings can potentially grow tax-free. Typically, you can grant any amount to an operating charity at any time. And you can direct your gift toward a specific purpose or wherever the charity needs funding to fulfill its mission. As with other investment accounts, you might pay administrative or investment fees—such as operating expenses or commissions—depending on how your assets are invested and managed. Also, take note that a donor-advised fund is irrevocable, meaning you can\\'t withdraw funds for non-charitable giving purposes. Upon your death, your survivors may use your account to continue your legacy of giving, close the account and distribute the assets to one or more charities, or roll over the assets into the fund sponsor\\'s endowment. It would be wise to state your wishes in your estate planning documents as soon as you open your account. Sharing the wealth Even as the economy and people\\'s financial situations recover from the effects of the pandemic, the need for charitable giving will always remain. Consider including a giving strategy as part of your financial plan. Your investment, tax, and legal advisors can help you determine the best strategies to amplify your generosity. 1\"Charitable giving grew 5.1 percent in 2020, \\'Giving USA\\' finds.\" https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/charitable-giving-grew-5.1-percent-in-2020-giving-usa-finds. 2\"The Blackbaud Institute Index, Your Source for Charitable Giving Trends.\" https://institute.blackbaud.com/the-blackbaud-institute-index/. 3Standard deduction limits for 2021 are $25,100 for married couples filing jointly, $12,550 for single filers and married couples filing separately, and $18,800 for heads of households. 4Operating charities, or qualifying public charities, are defined by Internal Revenue Code section 170(b)(1)(A). Donor-advised funds, supporting organizations, and private foundations are not considered qualifying public charities. 5Annual income tax deduction limits for gifts to public charities, including donor-advised funds, are 30% of adjusted gross income (AGI) for contributions of non-cash assets held more than one year and 60% of AGI for contributions of cash. Donation amounts in excess of these deduction limits may be carried over up to five tax years. 6A donor\\'s ability to claim itemized deductions is subject to a variety of limitations, depending on the donor\\'s specific tax situation.

       "   'content': 'It hasn\\'t exactly been smooth sailing for fixed income investors in 2021. Bond yields have ridden waves of optimism and pessimism about the economy for most of the year. The faster-than-expected reopening of the economy from COVID-19 shutdowns early in the year led to a surge in yields during the first quarter, only to be followed by a plunge in the summer as virus cases rebounded. As we close the books on the year, short-term yields have moved up to the highest levels since early 2020 in anticipation of tighter monetary policy, but 10-year Treasury yields have fallen back from the 1.70% level reached in October despite soaring inflation.

Yields will likely move higher for all maturities with more volatility as the support from easy monetary policy ebbs. The yield curve could go through bouts of steepening from time to time, but the long-term trend is likely to be a \"bear flattener,\" where yields rise but the difference between short- and long-term yields narrows. Our estimate for the high end of the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield is in the 1.75% to 2.0% range. The biggest uncertainty around our outlook is how central banks—particularly the Federal Reserve—will react to inflation in 2022.

The tide of liquidity is receding Illustration by Charlos Gary. © 2021 Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. The one trend that\\'s clear for 2022 is that the ultra-loose monetary policies pursued by central banks since the onset of the pandemic are ending. Policy rates have already begun to rise in major emerging market countries in response to rising inflation and steep currency declines. Among the developed markets, Norway and New Zealand have raised rates, while Canada recently ended its bond buying program. Whether the pace is fast or slow, the overall trend is towards \"less easy\" monetary policy around the globe. Two-year global bond yields, year to date Source: Bloomberg.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Less easy money circulating should mean higher interest rates and a decline in the relative value of risk assets, but the effects depend on the pace and magnitude of the policy shift. When central banks tighten policy quickly, the yield curve tends to flatten on expectations that a reduction in credit flowing to the economy will slow growth. When central banks are slow to tighten policy, the yield curve tends to steepen as it allows inflation pressures to build. For riskier segments of the fixed income markets, like high-yield corporate bonds, a series of fast rate hikes would likely cause a sharper decline in prices than a slow pace since it would signal the potential for a sharper slowdown in growth. Federal Reserve policy outlook: Slow runoff To date, the Federal Reserve has signaled only a modest shift in policy. It is beginning to taper its bond purchases, but members of the Fed\\'s policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), are split on when an initial rate hike might occur. Based on guidance from the Fed, it will reduce its bond purchases by $15 billion per month in total, cutting its Treasury purchases by $10 billion and its mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion. At that pace, the Fed will likely have completed the taper by June. We doubt that tapering itself will have much impact on bond yields since it has been widely communicated to the market. Moreover, the decline in Fed purchases of Treasuries should be offset by a decline in Treasury issuance in 2022, so there won\\'t be excess supply for the market to absorb relative to this year.

Tapering isn\\'t tightening. As long as the Fed is buying bonds, it is still running a loose monetary policy. Interest income earned on the bonds, as well as maturing bonds, will continue to be reinvested, and its balance sheet will continue to grow. It\\'s just a \"less easy\" policy.

Once tapering is over, the Fed will likely shift into tightening mode, assuming the recovery is on track and inflation is still elevated. Currently, the market is pricing in a high probability of two rate hikes in 2022 and three more in 2023. That\\'s well ahead of the Fed\\'s most recent estimates, which indicate a slower path of rate hikes. The Fed\\'s view of the path of rate hikes vs. the market\\'s view Source: Bloomberg.

Note: The 12/15/2027 eurodollar futures rate was used for the Longer-Run market rate. Despite market expectations for a series of rapid increases in rates over the next two years, it\\'s notable that it is pricing in a lower longer-run rate for federal funds than the Fed. A low estimate of this \"terminal rate\" suggests investors don\\'t believe economic growth will be strong enough on a sustained basis to warrant a policy rate much above 2% in this cycle, which is slightly lower than the previous cyclical peak in 2019 and far below the 5.25% levels seen in 2006. Our expectation is that the Fed will take a gradual approach to tightening monetary policy as long as inflation expectations do not remain significantly above the 2.5% to 3.0% level. Since it adopted its \"flexible average inflation targeting\" policy in the summer of 2020, the Fed has emphasized its willingness to let inflation overshoot 2% for a period of time in order to allow more time for the unemployment rate to fall. Nonetheless, several Fed officials have indicated concerns about inflation recently. Even Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that inflation has lasted \"longer than expected\" and that the Fed would favor raising rates if there are \"serious risks of higher inflation expectations.\" Consequently, we are watching two key indicators—inflation expectations and the employment-to-population ratio. Currently, inflation expectations have risen, but mostly for shorter time horizons. Since the September FOMC meeting, breakeven rates in the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) market have spiked up for one- and two-year maturities relative to long-term maturities. Breakeven inflation rates are the difference between the yield of a TIPS and the yield of nominal Treasury of similar maturities. With short-term breakeven rates higher than long-term breakeven rates, the market is pricing in declining inflation rates over the long run compared to today\\'s elevated readings.

The breakeven inflation rate is the difference between the yield of a TIPS and the yield of a nominal Treasury with a comparable maturity; it is the rate that inflation would need to average over the life of the TIPS for it to outperform a nominal Treasury. On the employment outlook, there is still a significant gap to be filled to recover to pre-pandemic levels. There are about 4.5 million fewer people working now than in late 2019. Many different explanations for the relatively slow pace of job growth relative to job openings are possible —health concerns, child-care issues, shifts in industries seeking workers, and early retirements. Some at the Fed, including Chair Powell, are inclined to allow more time for the job market to recover, while others don\\'t expect the supply of labor to reach pre-pandemic levels. We are watching the employment-to-population ratios as a guide to the Fed\\'s response. The ratio for prime-age workers—those between 25 and 54—is the most significant, because it captures the group that historically has had the highest engagement in the workforce. Closing the gap for this group would open the door to Fed tightening. Employment-to-population ratio Source: Bureau of Labor and Statistics.

One complicating factor for estimating the Fed\\'s \"reaction function\" is the potential for significant turnover at the FOMC. Powell\\'s term is up in February and to date, he has yet to be renominated. Similarly, Vice Chair Richard Clarida\\'s terms is ending in 2022 and it isn\\'t clear who will take that role. Between terms that are ending and retirements, there could be as many as four new faces at the FOMC. After the flood We estimate that 10-year Treasury yields could rise as high as the 1.75% to 2.00% region, based on our view that the economy will grow at a relatively fast clip in 2022. Despite setbacks due to supply constraints for many goods, the drivers of economic growth—consumer spending and business investment—look poised to stay firm. Consumers have high levels of assets, the job market is strong, and wages are rising. Corporations have record amounts of liquid assets, and strong earnings, which should fuel investment and hiring. Banks are flush with cash to lend, and fiscal policy is likely to contribute to growth, as well. Financial conditions—the ease with which companies and individuals can obtain funds—are very easy. Historically, when conditions are very loose economic growth is above trend in the following twelve months. Financial conditions are very loose Source: Bloomberg. Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS Index), daily data as of 11/10/2021. Note: The Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index tracks the overall level of financial stress in the U.S. money, bond, and equity markets to help assess the availability and cost of credit. A positive value indicates accommodative financial conditions, while a negative value indicates tighter financial conditions relative to pre-crisis norms. The Y axis is truncated at -2.0 for scale purposes. For reference purposes, 2020 low was -6.335. As the effects of the pandemic fade and central banks exit their extremely loose policies, we expect yields to return to levels more consistent with potential economic growth. Potential gross domestic product (GDP) is the level of sustainable output that could be achieved given all of the resources in the economy today. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)\\'s forecast is for potential GDP to rise in 2022, thanks in large part to the strong dose of fiscal stimulus provided during the COVID downturn. With the economy poised for stronger growth, we expect the 10-year Treasury yield to move up to as high as 2%. Over the long run, potential GDP has a strong relationship with 10-year Treasury yields.

Similarly, we expect a rise in yields to close the gap with inflation expectations. Real yields—nominal adjusted for inflation expectations—have been negative since the onset of the pandemic. Even with easing inflation pressures next year, yields may need to move higher to close the gap, because negative real yields don\\'t make much sense in an economy growing at a healthy pace with rising inflation. Real yields remain deeply in negative territory Source: Bloomberg. US Generic Govt TII 10 Yr (USGGT10Y INDEX) and US Generic Govt TII 5 Yr (USGGT05Y INDEX). Daily data as of 11/10/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Widening credit spreads is another likely outcome of declining liquidity in markets. With short-term interest rates set at zero, investors have been increasingly willing to take on more risk to find attractive yields. As central banks begin to raise rates, the prospect of potentially slower economic growth combined with higher risk-free rates could mean that riskier asset classes underperform as investor preferences shift. If the Fed takes a patient approach to tighter policies, riskier bond investments may hold their value, but a faster pace of rate hikes could result in more volatility, wider credit spreads, and lower prices. Opportunities as the tide rolls out As the tide moves out on the ultra-easy monetary policies of central banks in 2022, we suggest investors look for opportunities to add duration in their portfolios. It may be tempting to wait for the Fed to begin raising short-term rates to buy intermediate- or long-term bonds, but based on our research that may not be the best approach. In the past three cycles of Fed tightening, 10-year Treasury yields have fallen from interim peak levels in the six to 12 months prior to the initial rate hike. Markets are forward-looking and the expectation that the Fed may engineer a slowdown in the economy is already on the radar for many investors. In 2022, the reaction of central banks to inflation is likely to be the key factor to watch. The market has anticipated Fed rate hikes in most cycles Source: Bloomberg. U.S. Generic 10-year Treasury Yield (USGG10YR INDEX), using weekly data for the specified time periods. Weekly data as of 11/10/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. We will be looking for opportunities to add to intermediate- and long-term bond holdings as yields move higher. While there may be periods when the yield curve steepens, long-term demand for low-risk bonds remains strong. Aging populations around the globe are driving up savings and the demand for safe yields. Pension funds, insurance companies, and other long-term investors should continue to invest in long-term government bonds to offset their liabilities. Bond ladders or barbells can be effective strategies for averaging into higher yields over time. For 2022, we suggest a more careful approach to the riskier segments of the fixed income markets, such as high-yield corporate and emerging-market bonds. While current conditions are still positive, valuations appear stretched and vulnerable to a shift in the outlook for the economy. Finally, we are keeping an eye on the U.S. dollar. Over the past few years, the dollar\\'s strength has resulted in underperformance by international developed country bonds. Relative interest rate differentials still look supportive to the U.S. bond market, but if global economic cycles and policy rates become more synchronized, the outlook could change. We remain cautious on emerging-market bonds going into 2022, however, due to the combination of weakening currencies and high inflation. In sum, we expect another wave up in bond yields in 2022 as central banks around the world shift away from the very easy policies of the past few years. With the pandemic-era policies ending, investors should be prepared for shifting tides and the risks and opportunities they present.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'For the millions of workers without the steady income of a 9-to-5 job, here’s how to save for retirement.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Not every worker fits the classic 9-to-5 mold. In fact, millions of Americans identify as self-employed, part-time workers, or homemakers, bucking traditional career paths either by circumstance or choice. And while saving for retirement may be more of a challenge without a steady paycheck, that doesn’t mean you should lose sight of your financial future. “Time is fleeting, and you don’t want to regret not putting away even small amounts when you can,” says Chris Kawashima, CFP®, a senior research analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “Even if you go against the grain with a more untraditional way of work, you can still stay on track for retirement.” Here are some different financial situations that might relate to your current household—and how to keep on track to reach your retirement goals. You want to ditch the 9-to-5 If you’re ready for a new stage in life, abandoning a traditional job is no reason to also abandon good financial sense—or your retirement goals. “Before changing careers or that steady line of work, ask yourself: Do you have the assets to carry you through the transition?” Chris says. Making the leap from financial security to a less predictable path requires preparation. It’s important to have an emergency fund for three to six months’ expenses. If you’re starting a business you may want to increase that amount to double—or even more— before taking the leap from stable employment. “If you’re starting a business, it’s not only about your own personal expenses you need to support during the transition,” Chris warns. “Your business may require you to take on overhead expenses as well as any one-time costs needed to get you up and running.” Once you have established your personal safety net, you can start thinking about where to put away what income you can. Contractors and self-employed workers have options to save for retirement, including starting your own individual 401(k), a SEP IRA, or a SIMPLE IRA. Compared to traditional IRAs, these retirement savings plans provide the potential to save more and reduce taxable income. If you max out one of these plans, you can still put additional retirement savings into a personal IRA. If you’re not starting a business, but are working for a company on a part-time or temporary basis, check to see if a company retirement plan is available to you. With the current employment demand, more employers are allowing part-time workers to contribute to employer-sponsored 401(k) plans. If that’s the case for your company, sign up during the next open enrollment period or when you become eligible, and try to contribute enough to get the full match, if available. If a company plan is not available to you, earned income from part-time work—including tips, professional fees, and self-employed income—allows you to open, and contribute to, your own IRA. By contributing to your own IRA, you may be able to get a tax deduction on the amount you contribute. You’re not working, but your spouse is If you’re part of a single-income household, you might be able to still contribute to an IRA without any earned income. Enter the spousal IRA. It’s not a different IRA type, but simply a traditional or Roth IRA that lets a nonworking spouse have access to the tax benefits of one. The account is not jointly owned and is a separate one set up in your own name. “A spousal IRA can be a great tool if the working member of the household has the income to spare,” Chris says. “You can save and invest more, and you may be able to get a tax deduction and potential tax credit on the contribution.” There are some important rules to keep in mind with a spousal IRA: You must be married and file a joint tax return in order to open one. Typical IRA income and contribution limits apply, and the total contributions of your IRAs can’t be more than the taxable income reported on your joint return. You’re in a tight spot Even if your budget is tight, chances are you can still put aside something—even a small amount. “To save at all with an unstable or low income is a tremendous amount of work,” Chris says, “but with the right mindset, savings can simply become a part of your budget.” For example, you could try making your savings automatic and out-of-sight like a subscription service, putting away $20 at first each month into a savings account or IRA. Then, if you find that’s comfortable, gradually increase that amount to fit in with the rest of your budget. “Everyone has a sweet spot where they can fund toward their future and take care of the bills. And Uncle Sam can help,” Chris says. If you’re a lower-income taxpayer, you might be eligible for a Saver’s Credit—a tax credit worth up to $1,000 for singles or $2,000 if you’re married and filing jointly. You’re eligible for the credit if you’re 18 years old or older, not claimed as a dependent on another person’s return and not a student. The percentage of your contribution that you can claim depends on your income level and filing status, so check carefully to see how you might qualify. Bottom line Regardless of the reasons, financial uncertainty is a familiar state for millions of Americans. “You can’t put off planning for your future until the perfect moment arrives,” says Chris, “Because there is no perfect moment. Saving a little bit now is always better than waiting and saving nothing.”'},\n",

That's why traders look for other indications of enthusiasm when they want to confirm or refute a price signal.

While swings in trading volume may not be enough on their own to reveal changes in a trend, they can give you a sense of how much strength there is behind a move. Here's how you can use volume indicators in your trading. What traders look for In short, above average and/or increasing trading volume can signal that traders are truly committed to a price move, which you can see in Chart 1 below, where the price and volume lines are both increasing.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I’m 72 and thinking about leaving one of my IRAs to my grandchildren, ages 19, 13, 9, and 8. Can you tell me if this is a good idea, especially since they are minors, and what the minimum distribution requirements would be? —A Reader Dear Reader, In many ways, leaving an IRA to your grandchildren can be a great idea. The money continues to grow tax-deferred during your lifetime, and when your grandkids inherit it, they’ll have a couple options about when and how to withdraw the money. However, it’s not quite as simple as just naming them as the beneficiaries—for a few reasons. First, you need to think about what would happen if your grandchildren inherited the money while they’re still minors. It’s also important to keep in mind that the distribution rules are stricter than they used to be. Under the SECURE Act passed in December 2019, most non-spouse beneficiaries have just 10 years to draw down the funds from inherited retirement accounts. Previously, they had the luxury of stretching distributions across their lifetimes. Additionally, each beneficiary may have different needs in terms of when asset distributions would be most effective. Finally, you’ll want to think about how the distributions will be taxed. So, while I applaud your generosity and forethought—and in no way want to dissuade you—here are some things to address in advance. Minors can’t inherit an IRA outright The age of majority generally ranges from 18 to 21, depending on the state of residence. In your case, while your oldest grandchild might be able to inherit money directly, you should strongly consider establishing a custodian—typically a minor’s legal guardian—for the three younger ones. A custodian would manage the money until the children reached their state’s recognized age of adulthood. At that time, they would have complete access to the funds. If you don’t designate a custodian, a parent would have to ask the probate court to assign a property guardian. Naming a custodian as part of your beneficiary designation would avoid this complication. Another option is to set up a trust. This requires a bit more expense and time (you’ll need to work with an estate planning attorney), but a trust will give you more control over how and when the money can be used. For instance, while you might be thinking the inheritance will help pay for education or a down payment on a house, a young beneficiary might be more tempted to buy a fancy car. To me, going with a trust will depend on how much money you’re talking about and how concerned you are about your grandchildren handling their inheritance responsibly. Grandchildren must distribute the assets within 10 years Grandchildren generally fall under the category of “designated beneficiary,” which means they can distribute inherited IRA assets however they like—without taking a required minimum distribution (RMD) each year—as long as all assets are distributed within 10 years of your death. In other words, your grandchildren can take some assets out each year or just leave all the assets in the account until the last day of the 10-year limit. Any assets that aren’t distributed by the end of the 10th year will be subject to a 50% penalty. There are some exceptions to this 10-year rule, however. Grandchildren who are disabled or chronically ill may distribute assets over the course of their lifetime—though they will be subject to RMDs. How the assets are distributed over time could have important tax considerations, so it’s best to consult with a tax advisor. Your grandkids will likely have to pay taxes on distributions Distributions from earnings and deductible contributions from a traditional IRA are considered ordinary income, meaning your grandkids will have to pay taxes on distributions. The story is different if you’re passing on a Roth IRA, for which they won’t have to pay taxes, so long as you opened the account at least five years prior to your passing. If it hasn’t been five years, they can either or wait until the five-year holding period has passed to take distributions or pay income tax on the earnings portion of the account (as you would have paid tax on the principal). Three practical considerations Just for the record, it’s important for everyone to understand that your grandchildren wouldn’t be subject to the usual 10% penalty that would apply to a regular account holder who attempted to distribute money from their retirement account before age 59½—regardless of their age when they take a distribution. Your grandchildren (or their custodians) should also understand that they won’t be able to make additional contributions to an inherited IRA (however, if they have earned income, their parents can set up custodial IRAs for them). Lastly, keep in mind that withdrawals from an inherited IRA may affect student financial aid considerations for your grandchildren. Run this by an advisor Naming a grandchild as an IRA beneficiary can be a tax-smart way to pass on money—both for you and for your grandkids. But as you can see, the devil is in the details, so I strongly suggest talking this over with your financial advisor and an estate planning attorney. In some cases, it may make more sense to name your spouse as the designated beneficiary to take advantage of spreading the distribution over their lifetime, and then they can name your grandchildren as beneficiaries. What matters is finding a way that works best for everyone now but will also benefit your grandkids later on. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'These unexpected expenses can derail your retirement. Here’s how to get ahead of them.',\n",
       "   'content': 'When you\\'re living off your savings, unexpected expenses can undo years of diligent planning. \"Withdrawing an extra $10,000 for a new roof from savings might not seem like much in the grand scheme of things, but it set back a plan for other expenses, if you haven\\'t anticipated it—especially since those funds are no longer at work in the market,\" says Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. When every dollar counts, your retirement spending plan needs to anticipate obstacles as much as possible. To that end, here are five common—yet unexpected—setbacks that can upend your retirement plan and how to better prepare for them. 1. Hidden housing costs Nearly 80% of those ages 65 and older own their homes, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. However, a lot of pre-retirees fail to look beyond their monthly mortgage payment when estimating their long-term housing costs. Research from the Society of Actuaries found that unanticipated home repairs are retirees’ single most common financial surprise.1 \"If it\\'s been a while since you purchased your residence, having it re-inspected by a professional can help identify hidden problems before they become major headaches,\" Rob says. A good rule of thumb is to budget 1% of your home\\'s total value for annual repairs and maintenance. If you aim to remain in your home long-term, you should also factor in potential costs or improvements, such as creating wheelchair access or other disability-related alterations. \"As unpleasant as it is to contemplate, anticipating and planning for such challenges can make the transition easier—physically, emotionally, and on your finances,\" Rob says. 2. Uncovered health care Even with Medicare, it\\'s no secret that health care can cost you a pretty penny in retirement. \"But many retirees don\\'t fully appreciate just how much, in part because they believe Medicare covers more than it actually does,\" says David Jamison, a Certified Financial Planner™ professional and senior manager with Schwab\\'s Centralized Planning Group. Original Medicare comprises Part A, which covers hospital stays, and Part B, which covers doctor visits. Many other expenses and services you might assume were routine—such as dental, hearing, and vision care, as well as copays and prescription drugs—are covered only through supplemental plans, which cost extra. For more complete coverage, you may need multiple plans. For example, you can sign up for Medicare\\'s stand-alone prescription drug program, known as Part D, as well as purchase a private Medigap policy to help cover deductibles, coinsurance, and copays. You could also add private insurance to cover routine dental, hearing, and vision care. Another approach would be to buy a private Medicare Advantage plan, which bundles parts A and B and can include dental, hearing, and vision care. It\\'s important to understand that each approach may come with costs and trade-offs. Medigap plans, for instance, may mean fewer out-of-pocket expenses but generally have higher premiums. Medicare Advantage, on the other hand, may have lower premiums but could involve more out-of-pocket expenses. All told, it\\'s reasonable to start with a budget between $450 and $850 per month per person for health care costs, including plan premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The amount can vary widely, though, based on your situation as well as your current and future health or care needs. \"To help meet the rising costs of health care in retirement, a useful strategy to consider is contributing to a health savings account (HSA) each year while you’re working, if eligible,\" Rob says. Contributions to HSAs are federally tax deductible, earnings are tax-free, and withdrawals are also tax-free if used for qualified medical expenses, which include Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket costs but not Medigap and Medicare Advantage premiums. You can keep these savings, invest them without a drag from taxes, and use them in retirement to cover all or a portion of your health care costs, including premiums. 3. Long-term care The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that close to 70% of today\\'s 65- year-olds will require some kind of long-term care for an average of about three years, and the costs are high and rising. For example, the national average cost2 for an in-home health aide in 2021 was $61,776, whereas a private room in a nursing home facility was $108,405. \"Americans are becoming more aware of these potential expenses, but most still don\\'t really plan for them—or even know where to start,\" David says. Some retirees may be able to reduce long-term care costs by turning to their families for help, but those who can\\'t or don\\'t want to rely on their loved ones, or who realize there are financial and emotional costs for potential family caregivers as well, generally cover these expenses in one of two ways: Out of pocket: One approach is to pay out of pocket if and when the need arises, in which case you\\'ll need significant savings to cover such costs. The benefit of this approach is that you pay for only what you need, which may be attractive to wealthier individuals who don\\'t want to pay for insurance they may not use. Remember, too, that there’s often a financial cost for loved ones tasked to provide care, even if there\\'s not an explicit cost for private in-home or other care. Long-term care insurance: For most people, coming up with an extra $100,000 or more isn\\'t realistic. Long-term care insurance may allow them to get the quality care they need without having to liquidate their assets to pay for it. David says it\\'s generally best to purchase a policy in your 50s or early 60s, assuming you’re still healthy and insurable, to lock in a more affordable premium. \"Yes, you’ll be paying for something you might not end up needing, but that\\'s true of many types of insurance—and you will have turned a potential financial surprise into a predictable expense,\" he notes. When deciding which option is best for you, take into account your estate planning goals. Even if you can afford to pay out of pocket, a long-term care policy can help protect your savings if you want to leave a legacy or inheritance. 4. A child in crisis It\\'s natural to want to step in when your child needs financial help. But the older you are, the more difficult it can be to recover from such an unanticipated expenditure, depending on the money you\\'ve saved versus potential future needs. In fact, half of all parents financially helping an adult child say it\\'s putting their retirement savings at risk.3 \"When an adult child falls on hard times, retired parents often feel obligated to help, even when their savings can\\'t really accommodate the added expense,\" David says. Before offering your support, think about how much help you\\'re able to provide—and for how long. \"Are you willing to withdraw a large lump sum from your savings, for example, or would you be more comfortable covering smaller expenses over a longer time frame while they get back on their feet?\" Rob asks. If you do decide to dip into your retirement savings, be sure to have an honest conversation with your child about the terms of the arrangement—including whether the money will be a gift or a loan—and be clear about the extent to which you\\'re willing to help. \"Boundaries and clear communication are really important in a situation like this,\" David emphasizes. \"Your child may see the money as a gift while you expect to be paid back, which can cause conflict down the line.\" If you both agree to a loan, however, make sure you understand the rules surrounding intrafamily loans before you finalize the terms—the details are complicated and can create unexpected tax consequences. For example, the IRS sets a minimum rate for such loans, called the applicable federal rate (AFR), which changes each month but generally approximates the rate paid by certificates of deposit and savings accounts. If your loan’s rate is below the AFR, or the IRS determines that the loan wasn’t really a loan at all, it may be treated as a gift for tax purposes (and subject to the $16,000 annual gift tax exclusion). 5. Losing a spouse There\\'s little you can do to prepare for the emotional shock of losing your spouse. But failing to prepare for it financially can leave you in a precarious position. The good news is there are steps you can take now, and in the future, to mitigate such risk: Life insurance: The lump sum paid upon the insured\\'s death can help offset a loss of income—be it from a paycheck, a pension, or Social Security. \"Review your net worth statement, future cash flows, and goals to see if there are any significant gaps you may want to insure for your surviving spouse,\" Rob advises. Pensions: If you or your spouse is eligible for a pension, investigate survivorship options before you retire. \"Opting for survivor benefits may reduce your monthly benefit, but payments will persist even after you pass,\" Rob says. It\\'s best to weigh your options with a financial planner, who can help you think through how all your sources of income fit together—now and after a death. Social Security: Your surviving spouse is eligible to receive your Social Security benefit upon your death. If you\\'re the higher earner and not yet collecting benefits, it may make sense to delay doing so as long as possible. That\\'s because every year you delay past full retirement age (between 66 and 67 for today\\'s retirees) increases your benefit by 8% (up to age 70, past which there is no incremental benefit). Not only does this increase your benefit during your lifetime, but it also ensures the surviving spouse—whether that\\'s you or your mate—is left with the biggest possible benefit. Once one spouse dies, the survivor can collect reduced benefits as early as age 60 (50 if disabled) but waiting until full retirement age will ensure the largest payout. \"Remember,\" says Rob, \"Social Security can be viewed as type of insurance, to provide payments, that will rise with inflation each year and last as long as you, or your spouse, does.\" Finally, make sure your estate plan is organized and up to date to help ensure a smooth transition of assets upon your passing. An estate-planning attorney can help you identify and correct any gaps in your plan. Don\\'t stress It\\'s impossible to dodge every curveball life will throw at you, but even a little extra forethought can make unexpected expenses more manageable. \"Working with a financial planner—who can discuss each of these issues, and others—can help you anticipate potential problems and prepare you for surprises when they arise,\" Rob says. \"And the more prepared you are, the more confident you\\'re likely to feel as you transition to retirement.\" 1 Anna Rappaport, Shocks and the Unexpected: An Important Factor in Retirement, Society of Actuaries, 2017. 2 \"Cost of Care Survey,\" Genworth, 2021. 3 Kelly Anne Smith, \"Half of parents financially helping their adult children say it’s putting retirement savings at risk,\" bankrate.com, 04/24/2019.'}],\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I’ve just had a baby! Things are pretty crazy in my house right now, but I want to be sure I give my daughter every opportunity I can. I have a little bit of money saved up, but I’m uncertain what the best use is for it. Should I buy a savings bond, open a CD, start an investment account, or put it all in a college fund? —A Reader Dear Reader, First, congratulations to both you and your daughter. I’d say she’s fortunate to have a mother who, in the midst of all the new baby responsibilities, is already thinking about the future. As a parent myself, I can tell you that the future—and all the related expenses—comes all too quickly! Being ready for those expenses goes hand-in-hand with smart saving habits, so it’s great that you’ve already begun. Whatever the future holds, continuing to save will be the cornerstone of providing a solid financial foundation for your daughter. In terms of what to do with the money you’ve already saved, that depends on how you expect to use it. While college is often a primary goal, there will be many interim financial goals that you’ll want to meet as your daughter grows up. Let’s look at how you might plan for each. Consider a 529 account for college savings When it comes to planning for higher education, a tax-advantaged college savings account, such as a 529 plan, is often the best choice. This is a state-sponsored program that lets parents, relatives, and friends invest for a child’s college education. The account belongs to you, not your child, and you remain in control of the money. Usually, 529s offer a selection of professionally managed investment portfolios, including age-based funds. Potential earnings grow tax-deferred. And you pay no federal taxes on earnings as long as you use the money for qualified higher education expenses, such as tuition, books, and room and board. Some 529s even allow you to use up to $10,000 tax-free for K–12 tuition expenses. Opening and contribution minimums vary by state—some requiring either no initial deposit or subsequent contributions at all. And you’re not limited to your own state’s 529, so you’re free to shop around at different financial institutions (though you should first consider any state tax benefits your own state’s plan may offer). Plus, you can set up automatic contributions—say $50 or $100 a month—making it easy to keep saving. Under a special election, you can invest up to $75,000 as a single filer ($150,000 for married couples filing jointly) at one time by accelerating five years’ worth of contributions without being subject to gift taxes.1 Designate different accounts for other needs While a college account may be at the top of your list, there will be other opportunities—say music lessons or private schools—that you want to provide your daughter along the way. To save for such eventualities, consider these other types of accounts. Custodial brokerage account: This is a brokerage account established under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) and managed by a parent or guardian on a child’s behalf. It offers minor tax advantages and has few restrictions on how the money can be spent as long as it’s for the benefit of the child beyond daily living expenses. Unlike a 529, there are no curated investment portfolios. You can choose from a wide variety of investments—stocks, bonds, fractional shares, ETFs, mutual funds—according to your investment preferences and your feelings about risk. A key difference is that the child takes control of the money at the “age of majority,” which is 18, 21, or 25 depending on state rules. That’s something to think about. Regular brokerage account: This is a taxable account that you could open in your own name and earmark the savings and investments for your daughter. You’d then have the control and freedom to use the money as you see fit. Like a custodial brokerage account, you can choose from a wide array of investments. Passbook savings account: This could be for short-term savings needs. It’s also an account your daughter could contribute to as she gets older. As for investments, equities generally have the greatest potential for long-term growth. Realize, though, that because stocks are volatile, they should be reserved for goals beyond a five-year time frame. For shorter-term goals, CDs and savings bonds are safer; the tradeoff is that they offer very low interest rates. Create a plan If you have a savings plan, putting money aside will be easier, so here’s what I suggest right now. Assuming college is your first goal, put the money you currently have saved in a college savings account and commit to adding more each month. Not only do 529 plans offer the potential for tax-free earnings for qualified higher education expenses, but when it comes to federal aid, the ownership rules are more favorable than for custodial and brokerage accounts. There are a number of online calculators to help you determine a realistic monthly savings goal. While you determine your budget, review your life insurance needs and estate plan. With a growing family, it’s important to take steps to ensure there aren’t any gaps in protecting your loved ones. As you’re able to save more, consider a brokerage account or passbook savings account for other types of expenses. You might also establish a monthly savings goal for this account and put it on automatic as well. Don’t forget your daughter’s financial education As your daughter gets older, be sure to involve her in the process. Help her create her own savings goals and have her save a portion of any money she gets. This will get her into the savings habit early, teach her how money grows, and help her make good spending decisions. No matter how much you save for your child, teaching her to be financially independent is really the greatest opportunity you can give her. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'Whether it makes financial sense to pay off your mortgage depends on your individual situation. Here are some things to consider.',\n",
       "   'content': 'If you’re like most people, paying off your mortgage and entering retirement debt-free sounds pretty appealing. It’s a significant accomplishment and means the end of a major monthly expense. However, for some homeowners, their financial situation and goals might call for keeping a mortgage while attending to other priorities. Let’s look at the reasons why you might—or might not—decide to pay off a mortgage before you retire. You might want to pay off your mortgage early if … You’re trying to reduce your baseline expenses: If your monthly mortgage payment represents a substantial chunk of your expenses, you’ll be able to live on a lot less once the payment goes away. This can be particularly helpful if you have a limited income. You want to save on interest payments: Depending on a home loan’s size and term, the interest can cost tens of thousands of dollars over the long haul. Paying off your mortgage early frees up that future money for other uses. While it’s true you may lose the tax deduction on mortgage interest, you may still save a considerable amount on servicing the debt. You’ll have to reckon with a decreasing deduction anyway, as more of each monthly payment applies to the principal. Your mortgage rate is higher than the rate of risk-free returns: Paying off a debt that charges interest can be like earning a risk-free return equivalent to that interest rate. Compare your mortgage rate to the after-tax rate of return on a low-risk investment with a similar term—such as a high-quality, tax-free municipal bond issued by your home state. While mortgage rates are currently low, they’re still higher than interest rates on most types of bonds—including municipal bonds. In this situation, you’d be better off paying down the mortgage. You prioritize peace of mind: Paying off a mortgage can create one less worry and increase flexibility in retirement. You might not want to pay off your mortgage early if … You need to catch up on retirement savings: If you completed a retirement plan and find you aren’t contributing enough to your 401(k), IRA, or other retirement accounts, increasing those contributions should probably be your top priority. Savings in these accounts grow tax-deferred until you withdraw them. Your cash reserves are low: “You don’t want to end up house rich and cash poor by paying off your home loan at the expense of your reserves,” says Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. He recommends keeping a cash reserve of three to six months’ worth of living expenses in case of emergency. You carry higher-interest debt: Before you pay off your mortgage, first close out any higher-interest loans—especially nondeductible debt like that from credit cards. Create a habit of paying off credit card debt monthly rather than allowing the balance to build so that you’ll have fewer expenses when you retire. You might miss out on investment returns: If your mortgage rate is lower than what you’d earn on a low-risk investment with a similar term, you might consider keeping the mortgage and investing what extra you can. You need to diversify: Your house is just as much of an investment as what’s in your portfolio. And overconcentration carries its own risks—even when it’s in something as historically stable as a home. Maintaining your mortgage allows you to fund other asset classes with possibly more growth potential. If you decide to pay your mortgage off before you retire Ideally, you would accomplish your goal through regular payments. However, if you need to use a lump sum to pay off your mortgage, try to tap taxable accounts first instead of retirement savings. “If you withdraw money from a 401(k) or an individual retirement account (IRA) before 59½, you’ll likely pay ordinary income tax—plus a penalty—substantially offsetting any savings on your mortgage interest,” Rob says. A middle ground If your mortgage has no prepayment penalty, an alternative to paying it off entirely is to chip away at the principal. You can do this by making an extra principal payment each month or by sending in a partial lump sum. This tactic can save a significant amount of interest and shorten the life of the loan while maintaining diversification and liquidity. But avoid being too aggressive about it—lest you compromise your other saving and spending priorities. “Have a plan where you can both invest and pay down principal on a mortgage before or early in retirement,” Rob says. “You don’t have to make an all-or-nothing decision.” Should you refinance? It wasn’t that long ago that some mortgage rates were near or above 5%. If you’ve been in your home for a few years and are paying the original loan, you might consider refinancing. Current interest rates are relatively low, and depending on the type of loan you have, refinancing might make sense for you. If this is something you’re interested in pursuing, make sure you do a thorough cost-benefit analysis before pulling the trigger. Refinancing may not be a good idea if you plan to move soon or if closing costs and other loan expenses, such as fees or a new appraisal, would add to your financial burden. If you decide to refinance, though, avoid the temptation to take out more equity or increase your debt. The goal, ideally, should be to reduce debt on your primary home over time—not increase it.

       "   'content': 'When company stock or stock options are part of your compensation package, it can be tempting to treat such assets as a windfall, separate from your main portfolio. However, equity compensation is like any significant source of income—approach it carefully so you can make the most of it. Knowing what kind of stock or options you have, when they vest, and when and how they will be taxed are essential to understating how they fit into your financial plan. “Equity awards are complicated, so it’s important that you have a general understanding of how they work before you decide how to fit them into your financial plan and portfolio,” says Chris Kawashima, CFP®, a senior research analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Know what you own Have you been compensated with stock options or company shares? Companies may choose one over the other based on many factors, including the company’s own tax and accounting issues and what’s likely to work best for employees. Stock options are a common form of equity compensation. With them, you have the opportunity—but not the obligation—to buy company stock at a specified exercise price. This form of compensation is typically subject to a vesting schedule dictating when you’re allowed to exercise your options. Once vested, stock options will have value only if the current stock price is higher than the exercise price. (If it’s not, you wouldn’t want to exercise them.) The two main types of options are non-qualified stock options (NQSOs) and incentive stock options (ISOs). It’s important to know what type of stock option you have because they are treated differently for taxes. More on that below. Companies can also compensate you in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock units (RSUs). Such grants are “restricted” because they have conditions attached, such as length of employment or performance goals, and you generally can’t sell or transfer restricted stock or RSUs until vesting or other restriction requirements are met. With restricted stock, you may have voting and dividend rights because the company sets aside actual shares upon the grant. RSUs, on the other hand, are more like a promise to pay out shares or their equivalent value in cash. No shares are set aside upon the grant, so they don’t have the same rights to voting or dividends as restricted stock. The structure of the grant will determine when and how you can cash out and how taxes are assessed. When do you pay taxes? As suggested, different types of equity compensation can be taxed in very different ways. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research *Basis is generally set by fair market value at option exercise or stock vesting date; the holding period generally begins at exercise/vesting. Dual cost basis (ordinary and AMT) applies to ISO stock in a qualifying disposition. For treatment of basis and holding period under a Section 83(b) election, consult your tax expert. NQSOs: You are taxed when you exercise your options. The tax is based on the spread between the stock’s fair market value and the exercise price of the option. The value of the spread is treated as compensation and subject to ordinary income and payroll taxes. ISOs: You generally aren’t taxed until you sell the stock after exercising your options, giving them a potentially more favorable tax treatment than NQSOs. However, you must meet certain requirements to take full advantage. If you hold the stock for more than two years after the date the options were granted and at least one year after exercising them, the spread is taxed at the long-term capital gains rate, which is generally lower than your income tax rate. This is called a qualifying disposition. (Note: If you are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), qualifying dispositions lose some of their tax advantages as the spread could be treated as income in the tax year you exercise your options, potentially leading to additional taxes.) If you sell before these criteria are met, the spread at the exercise date is taxed as ordinary income, and any gains after the exercise date will be taxed as either a short- or long-term capital gain, depending on the holding period. This is called a disqualifying disposition. Restricted stock: The value of the stock grant (less the cost basis) is treated as compensation and is subject to ordinary income and payroll taxes—but timing matters. You’re allowed to make a so-called section 83(b) election within 30 days of the grant. This notifies the IRS that income tax on the stock should be assessed based on the valuation at the grant date (rather than later, when it vests). Why would you do this? Once you pay taxes based on the stock’s value at the time of the grant, any future gains in the stock’s price will be treated as long- or short-term capital gains, depending on the holding period. If you wait until the restricted stock vests to pay taxes, and the stock’s price rises, you could end up with a bigger tax bill. Of course, there’s also the risk that the stock’s price will fall after the grant or if you leave your company before the stock vests, in which case you would have paid more tax than you needed to. The taxes you paid aren’t refundable. RSUs: With RSUs, no shares are issued until shortly after vesting. At that time, the stock’s value (less the cost basis) is treated as compensation and is subject to ordinary income and payroll taxes. Any gain after the vesting period is treated as a capital gain. Additional tax considerations Most employers will withhold some portion of the value of your equity compensation from your paycheck. However, that withholding will essentially be an estimate of your actual tax liability and may not be enough. You could still end up owing more when you file. It’s also worth reiterating that once you take possession of any shares, capital gains tax (long or short term, depending on the holding period) will generally apply should you end up selling those shares at a higher price. Finally, because the tax implications of equity compensation can be complex, it’s worthwhile to consult a tax professional.

Knowing what you’ve got and how it will be taxed will help you determine how to make the most of your equity compensation. “When dealing with restricted stock, the current fair market value of the restricted shares is a good estimate of the value,” Chris says. “For ISOs or NQSOs, you can calculate their value based on the spread, using the current stock price and your exercise price.” For example, say you have an NQSO for 10,000 shares with an exercise price of $10 that is 100% vested. If the stock is trading at $20, and you have to pay a combined 40% in taxes (federal/state/FICA), that would leave you with a value of $6 per share (or $60,000 for those 10,000 shares). This is based on a relatively simple calculation. Your situation may be different, so consult with a tax professional or financial advisor for additional help. Stay diversified It’s important to be aware of the risk of overexposure when managing company equity. Typically, the stock of a single company should account for no more than 10% to 20% of your total portfolio. “Holding stock in the company you work for is uniquely risky as it may likely be down in price at a time when your job itself may be most at risk,” Chris cautions. It’s possible you could have more, depending on considerations such as your role in the company, selling restrictions, vesting schedule, and your other portfolio holdings. If you’re in this position, you may want to discuss how to manage your risk and ensure your portfolio is properly diversified with your financial advisor. Equity compensation, in any form, is a potential way to participate in your employer’s success. But like any other security, it must be carefully managed to keep with your long-term goals and financial plan.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'When it comes to teaching kids about investing, a custodial brokerage account can be a great way to go. \"Gifting kids investments or cash via custodial accounts—and then teaching them how to research and manage those assets—can lead to better investing habits in adulthood,\" says Chris Kawashima, CFP®, a senior research analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Once children reach the \"age of majority\"—typically 18, 21, or 25, depending on the state—they gain control over the account and can use the funds however they see fit. \"You can\\'t control what they ultimately do with the funds,\" cautions Chris, \"but if you communicate your values along the way, your child may be more likely to follow the path you intended.\" If this route sounds right for you, here are three things to know before opening an account: Gifts are irrevocable: Contributions to a custodial account are considered irrevocable—meaning you can\\'t get that money back—and funds can be withdrawn by the custodian only to pay for expenses that would directly benefit the child before the age of majority. Note, too, that contributions that exceed the annual gift tax exclusion—$15,000 for individuals or $30,000 for married couples—may be subject to gift tax. Investment gains may be subject to the so-called kiddie tax: If any of the investments generate dividends or interest or are sold for a gain while the child is a minor, the first $1,100 of that income is exempt from tax, the next $1,100 is taxed at the child\\'s single-filer rate, and anything beyond $2,200 is taxed at the parents\\' rate. The funds can decrease financial aid eligibility: Federal financial aid formulas—which determine eligibility for federal loans, grants, and even some scholarships—consider 20% of a student\\'s assets, including the custodial account\\'s value, as available for educational purposes. On the other hand, only 5.6% of parental assets (including 529 college savings accounts) are considered in the calculations. What\\'s more, it\\'s important to consider your ultimate goals for the money. If you\\'re hoping to help your child or grandchild save for college or get a head start on retirement, for example, funding a special-purpose account like a 529 or a Roth IRA may be a better way to go. \"Those accounts provide unique tax advantages that a custodial account doesn\\'t,\" Chris says. \"But if you\\'re looking to instill an enthusiasm for and appreciation of investing, custodial accounts are a great place to start.\" What you can do next Learn about the Schwab One® Custodial Account.

       "   'content': 'Think back to your education in personal finance. Did you learn about money management at home? At school? Through trial and error? “When I talk to people about their own financial educations, I hear a lot about regret—regret that they didn’t learn the fundamentals sooner,” says Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, CFP® professional, president of Charles Schwab Foundation, managing director of Schwab Community Services, and board chair of Schwab Charitable. “Indeed, entering the workforce with a solid understanding of money management can give you a real leg up in the long run.” Unfortunately, many young people aren’t getting an education in the fundamentals of financial independence, such as budgeting, investing, and saving.

When they’re little 1. Introduce the value of money An allowance is a good first step—especially if you tie at least part of it to chores that teach responsibility and work ethic. Earning an allowance introduces kids to the value of money and making choices for themselves. “In fact,” Carrie says, “kids often find they make different choices with their own money than they would with someone else’s.” 2. Emphasize saving At some point, your kids are going to want things that exceed their allowance. Encouraging them to save for those items teaches them the concepts of delayed gratification and trade-offs. Make a routine of setting aside a small portion—say, 10%—of every dollar they receive, including allowances and gifts. 3. Introduce them to investing Once your kids have saved some money, you can consider opening a custodial brokerage account for them or help them purchase fractional shares. Along with gaining a sense of ownership, your child can learn the importance of researching and managing their assets. Keep in mind there may be unique tax considerations for custodial accounts, so it’s generally best to work with an advisor to ensure they would be appropriate for your situation. “Let them choose a few stocks to invest in. Then, set up regular meetings to review their performance,” Chris suggests. “You might be surprised by how engaged kids can be when it comes to investing in a company they know and like.” Learn more about custodial accounts and fractional shares.

When they’re teenagers 4. Encourage a summer job “We know from our research that young people who have jobs are more likely to be better savers in the long run,” Carrie notes. So, make sure your child is saving a portion of every paycheck—and maybe even require them to help out with other expenses, as well. “It’s perfectly reasonable to expect kids to pay for their own gasoline or trips to the movies,” she says. 5. Introduce them to credit As teenagers become more independent and start driving themselves around, enrolling your child as an authorized user on one of your credit cards can be helpful. “From a practical perspective, having a credit card to deal with emergencies like flat tires is always a smart idea,” Carrie says. More to the point, your teen can learn to spend within their means—assuming you require them to pay back every dollar they charge. This is also a good opportunity to discuss the importance of being responsible with credit. When you take responsibility to pay back borrowed money, lenders can trust you more when you need to make a big purchase in the future. Chris emphasizes that it’s equally important to explain the basics, such as how credit cards differ from debit cards. And it’s essential to warn kids about the dangers of high-interest debt and revolving credit. “The more they know about debt, the more likely they are to manage it responsibly,” he stresses. 6. Consider a Roth IRA Once your kids have earned income, they can start contributing to an individual retirement account (IRA). Chris suggests a Roth IRA for most young savers. “Roths are funded with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement can be entirely tax-free,” he explains.2 “By funding these accounts early—when their income, and thus their tax rate, is still very low—kids could benefit from decades of compound growth and tax-free income in retirement.” When they’re young adults 7. Help them set a budget Once your kids accept their first jobs after college, help them draw up budgets based on their salaries and estimated expenses. “When you’ve never lived on your own, it’s easy to underestimate common expenses, such as groceries and utilities,” Carrie notes. It’s also a good idea to review their employer benefits with them to ensure they’re taking full advantage of all available options, especially any matching contributions to employer-sponsored retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s. “It’s important for them to understand the value of those matching contributions,” Carrie says. “It’s like free money!” 8. Encourage them to stay invested Help your kids understand that time is their greatest ally when it comes to investing. “The old saying ‘Time in the market is better than timing the market’ can’t be said enough to kids,” Chris says. As for the investments themselves, there are literally thousands of low-cost index funds to choose from—which can be overwhelming to a novice. When in doubt, choosing a product that allocates and invests their money for them might be the best approach. One such option is a target-date fund, whose asset allocation mix becomes more conservative as the target date approaches. Another option would be to consider a robo advisor that builds, monitors, and rebalances a diversified portfolio of exchange-traded funds on an investor’s behalf.

Let them know they’re not alone You want your kids to be fully independent adults, but you might need to step in to help them from veering off course from time to time. After all, making poor financial decisions can be an expensive learning experience. And if they have a question you can’t answer, Carrie suggests introducing them to your financial professionals. “You want them to get in the habit of asking for help if they need it—and not just from you,” she says. “Even the professionals get help—I know I do.” It all starts at home State governments are taking steps to support financial literacy in schools—Arkansas, Hawaii, and Nebraska all signed financial education bills into law this year3—but there’s still no substitute for leading by example. Showing your kids how you achieve your goals through budgeting, saving, and investing will give them confidence that they can do the same. 1Survey of the States 2020, 02/2020. 2If you take a distribution of Roth IRA earnings before you reach age 59½ and before the account is 5 years old, the earnings may be subject to taxes and penalties. You may be able to avoid penalties (but not taxes) in certain situations. If you’re older than 59½ but haven’t met the five-year holding requirement, your earnings may be subject to taxes but not penalties. Consult IRS rules before contributing to or withdrawing money from a Roth IRA. 3NGPF FinLit BillTracker as of June 1st, 06/01/2021.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'There are nearly as many types of trusts as there are individual circumstances.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Saving for retirement is only one component of your financial plan. Just as important is establishing an estate plan to make loved ones aware of your wishes should you become incapacitated or pass away. Getting your legal documents in order can ensure your assets are distributed according to your wishes and can minimize taxes, expenses, and unnecessary delays. Whereas everyone should have a will, the suitability of a trust depends on your individual circumstances. Trusts differ from wills in three key ways: A will goes through probate, in which a court reviews the document and ensures its validity; trusts bypass this process. A will takes effect only upon death, while a trust can take effect before death, after death, or in case of incapacitation. And finally, trusts come in all shapes and sizes, depending on your needs and those of your heirs. \"Wills can be flexible, too, but many trust types are designed for specific goals, such as charitable giving or providing for an heir with a disability,\" says Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Where to start A consultation with an estate-planning professional can help you decide if a trust is right for you. \"The first step may be to create a revocable living trust,\" says Tucker Smith, a Schwab senior manager of tax, trust, and estate in Denver. A revocable trust can be changed at any time and for any reason during the grantor\\'s, or creator\\'s, lifetime. \"You\\'re not giving up any control. It\\'s just a different way to hold your assets,\" Tucker explains. A revocable trust becomes irrevocable when the grantor dies or becomes incapacitated—meaning it can no longer be changed or revoked, depending on how the trust is structured. A revocable trust is often only a beginning, however. \"Think of a revocable living trust as an umbrella under which you can add any number of provisions or supplemental trusts tailored to your specific goals,\" Tucker says. Here are six common varieties of trusts individuals and families could consider when tailoring their legacy. For blended families If you\\'ve remarried but want to ensure your children from a prior relationship are cared for, a Qualified Terminable Interest Property (QTIP) trust can help. QTIPs provide for the living expenses of the surviving spouse. When that spouse dies, the QTIP distributes the remainder of the estate to the children of the original relationship. Often these trusts will include provisions that prevent the estate from being excessively drawn down during the surviving spouse\\'s lifetime. When it comes to taxes and QTIPs, estate taxes are deferred until the death of the surviving spouse. For heirs with a disability An inheritance can reduce or eliminate the government benefits to which dependents with disabilities may otherwise be entitled. A special-needs trust can help avoid this pitfall by agreeing to pay only those qualified education, equipment, insurance, and medical expenses not covered by federal or state benefits. \"If government benefits are paying for housing, but the house needs a wheelchair ramp, the trust can cover that,\" Tucker says. \"The trustee pays such expenses directly so that no money from the trust flows directly to the dependent.\" For the prodigal heir Leaving a lump sum isn\\'t always wise, especially if a loved one lacks financial know-how or struggles with alcohol, drug, or gambling dependencies. This is where a spendthrift trust comes in. This provision appoints a trustee to distribute the assets of the trust on an ongoing basis, rather than giving direct access to heirs themselves. An independent entity often administers a spendthrift trust to avoid family conflicts. \"A good trustee can help educate heirs about budgeting and financial planning,\" Tucker says. More to the point, the trustee typically distributes a preset amount based on a budget and may pay creditors and service providers directly. \"For example, I have a client whose son is an artist,\" Tucker says. \"He\\'s immensely talented; he\\'s just extremely right-brained and not especially astute at managing money.\" What\\'s more, because the beneficiary doesn\\'t control the trust, creditors may not be able to claim a right to its assets. For the philanthropically minded Charitable trusts fall into two basic camps, depending on when you want the donations to go to the charity or charities of your choice. One is a charitable lead trust, which provides a predetermined income to a charity for a set number of years, after which the remaining sum passes to your heirs. A charitable remainder trust does the opposite: It provides a fixed payment to the donor while living, with the remainder going to a charity upon her or his death. For example, if you own a rental property but no longer want to manage it, you might incur taxes on any sizable capital gains. By transferring ownership to a charitable remainder trust instead, you\\'ll still receive the income from it for as long as you live—along with a tax deduction for gifting it to the trust—without having to sell the building and pay capital gains. Upon your passing, the remaining trust assets will go to the charity. It\\'s important to keep in mind that charitable trusts are irrevocable. Once you transfer your assets, you no longer own them, so be sure to think through all your options before making a final decision. For those concerned about litigation Attorneys, medical professionals, and others may be especially susceptible to lawsuits. That\\'s why some turn to an asset-protection trust to shield their assets from potential litigation. This type of trust names the grantor as the beneficiary, often with a corporate entity serving as trustee. By law, these trusts can be established only if you\\'re not aware of a lawsuit or possible lawsuit. Many states—including California, New York, and Texas—prohibit asset-protection trusts, in which case individuals often turn to a corporate trustee in a state that permits them. For those wishing to maximize life insurance payouts The IRS considers life insurance benefits as part of an estate, so families with significant assets who also own or are considering purchasing a life insurance policy might benefit from an irrevocable life insurance trust, or ILIT. If your revocable living trust owns your life insurance policy, the death benefit would be included in the value of your estate. If, on the other hand, an ILIT owns your life insurance policy, it\\'s considered separate from the main estate and, therefore, not subject to estate taxes.1 A helping hand A basic understanding of the options out there is the first step to establishing a lasting legacy but is no substitute for consulting with the proper professionals. \"Financial consultants often have access to a network of estate-planning specialists who can help clients think through their options before enlisting an attorney to draft any trust documents,\" Tucker says. 1To be considered separate from the gross estate, existing policies must be gifted to an ILIT, and the insured must live at least three years beyond the gift date.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I\\'m a Marine and have just started to invest in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). But as a new investor, all the volatility and uncertainty in the stock market worries me. Should I stick with it? —A Reader Dear Reader, You may be a noob (aka newbie) investor, but your experience in the military may actually help you in handling the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) that\\'s a normal part of investing. It\\'s interesting to me that this military acronym has been adopted by the business community as a quick way to reference the constant change and unpredictability that seem to be intrinsic to many of today\\'s industries. It certainly applies to the stock market! But just as there are strategies to handle VUCA in military situations, there are strategic ways to approach investing that help you handle the inevitable ups and downs of the stock market. Another current acronym—HODL—is a good starting point. Based on a misspelling of \"hold\" in a post by a harried trader, HODL refers to certain buy-and-hold strategies of bitcoin speculators. But it can apply equally to other types of investing because taking a long-term view is the key to weathering VUCA. Does that mean you have to \"hang on for dear life?\" Not necessarily. However, once you have a well-thought-out asset allocation plan that is diversified and matches your own goals and feelings about risk, the key is—yes—to stick with it. Here are my suggestions for how to mitigate VUCA. Some of them might sound familiar. Keep your cool Volatility is a fact of investing life that can take you on an emotional roller coaster ride. Seeing your investments go up can give you a high that leads you to chase performance, buying the current high-fliers. Seeing them go down can make your stomach churn and lead to getting out when you should hang tight. The problem isn\\'t volatility itself, but how you react to it. The way to keep your cool and not overreact is to have a plan. That means knowing what you\\'re investing for (retirement? buying a home?), choosing investments that match your comfort level with risk, and resolving to keep your money working despite the inevitable declines. At times that may be boring, at times it can be exciting, and at other times terrifying. But to me, volatility isn\\'t the biggest risk. An even bigger risk is not investing—and not reaching your goals. The best strategy to handle volatility is to \"embrace the suck \" as they say in the military—ignore the noise and stay invested according to your long-term plan. Be flexible and save aggressively Even when you have a plan, there\\'s always some uncertainty. It\\'s not only the market that can change; your life situation and corresponding goals can also evolve. That\\'s why financial planning is an ongoing process, not a fixed course. To combat uncertainty, you need to be flexible enough to change your financial tactics as your needs change—while keeping your eye on your ultimate objectives. Another key strategy is to prepare for the unexpected. Make sure you have an emergency fund with enough ready cash to cover 3-6 months essential expenses. This will give you a safe harbor and room to maneuver when something unforeseen happens. Also make sure you have the right type and amount of insurance to help protect you and the people you care about against financial calamity. Still feeling uncertain? Save aggressively. Consider \"fire and forget\" solutions The stock market is complex and can be intimidating for a new investor, especially when it comes to choosing investments. However, you don\\'t have to be an investing expert if you follow a few simple principles. The first is to understand that every investment carries risk. Your job is to know how much risk you\\'re willing to take for a particular investment given your goals. The second is to spread your money across stocks, bonds, cash, and possibly real estate or commodities (your asset allocation) and make sure you\\'re diversified, which means having a mix of investments within each of these asset classes. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can make it simple to do this. Fortunately, the lifecycle (L) funds offered in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) provide one of the simplest ways to invest. They\\'re designed to give you a diversified mix of investments appropriate for your age. They also help you manage risk by automatically rebalancing in response to market conditions and as you get closer to your anticipated retirement date. For instance, if your retirement target is 2030, you\\'d choose L2030 and your fund would be managed accordingly. It\\'s a kind of \"fire and forget\" solution. Target date funds like the TSP L funds series are also increasingly common in civilian retirement plans like 401(k)s. Outside of the TSP, for example in an IRA or brokerage account, you can use professionally managed accounts or hire an advisor for more customized solutions so you can spend less time monitoring your investments. Focus on what you can control Investing can seem ambiguous because there are always unknowns. You can\\'t predict the market. You won\\'t always choose winners. So focus on what you can control. Save. Diversify. Keep costs low. Have a flexible plan. And don\\'t hesitate to get financial help from a trusted advisor whenever you have questions. Some of the very qualities Marines are known for—judgment, discipline, decisiveness, endurance—are qualities that will also help you as an investor. So, in spite of VUCA, I encourage you to stick with it. And thank you for your service. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'A surplus of goods and materials seems a long way off at the present. Supply shortages, lifting inflation and slowing production, endured all year as strong demand outstripped supply and have been worsened by supply chain logjams. Yet, history shows us that shortages often lead to gluts. Should a supply glut emerge in 2022, it may lead to a fall in inflation as excess inventory prompts price cuts. This complicates central bankers\\' tasks and helps explain their very slow steps towards ending pandemic-era policies. If they view the shortages as transitory, they want to be careful when raising interest rates to cool inflation pressures as a potential glut of supply also may begin to weigh on prices in the year ahead. From boom to bust The speed at which shortages can turn into gluts can be rapid, as seen in last year\\'s share price and earnings estimates for the world\\'s biggest maker of disposable gloves. The pandemic created a shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE) in the first half of 2020; Malaysia\\'s Top Glove, the world\\'s biggest maker of rubber gloves, saw its earnings prospects and stock price soar. Analysts\\' earnings estimates jumped by 1400% and the stock price rose by over 400%. By mid-year, production had caught up. By the time vaccines were announced in the fourth quarter, customer inventories were overstocked. As demand began to return to normal, earnings forecasts plunged, resulting in the stock giving up nearly all of its gains. 2020\\'s PPE Plunge Source: Charles Schwab, Factset data as of 11/7/2021. In 2021, we have seen that boom-and-bust pattern play out again, this time in the coal market. Widespread coal shortages, especially in China, drove up the price of coal futures and the stock prices of mining companies for much of this year. In October, China responded by announcing measures to increase coal production, including approvals for new mines, in an all-out effort to boost supply. These actions led to a crash in coal prices that brought down the stocks of mining companies at the same time. 2021\\'s Coal Crash Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 11/7/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Closer to the end than beginning In the past, the markets seem to have moved suddenly from a shortage to a glut. After a year of supply shortages, we may be closer to the end of the supply chain problems than the beginning. As a leading economic indicator, markets tend to look six-to-twelve months ahead; they may soon begin to consider the possibility that some shortages may have started to ease, and gluts may have started to form by the second half of next year. Should a glut begin to emerge by late next year, manufacturing inputs like semiconductors, finished goods such as cars and phones, and even containerships themselves may see supply outrun demand. Semiconductors - The semiconductor industry is capital intensive and semiconductors themselves have a relatively short life: a perfect scenario for frequent boom-and-bust cycles. The stocks of these companies tended to lead the downturns in sales and fall sharply on signs of inventories rebuilding, with a typical timeframe being a few quarters ahead of a sales\\' downturn. Already, there are signs that shortages are easing. The delivery time for chips increased in October by the smallest amount in some nine months suggesting a turn may be near, according to research by Susquehanna Financial Group. On their earnings calls, the two biggest European automakers, VW and Stellantis voiced optimism that the worst quarter of semiconductor shortages and the worst of the supply issues that have slowed production globally have passed. Similar comments were made by GM and Ford. According to market research firm IDC, the semiconductor industry is expected to return to balance by the middle of next year, with potential overcapacity in 2023 as large capacity expansions begin to come online by the end of next year. Major manufacturers, including Intel, Samsung, and TSMC, have plans to expand their chipmaking facilities. President Biden\\'s \"China bill\", having already passed the Senate, includes a $50-billion subsidy for the U.S. semiconductor industry, mirroring China\\'s heavy investment in new factories that will allow it to increase its own chip production. Semiconductor boom-and-bust cycles Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 11/7/2021. Finished goods - Many finished items in short supply now may become widely available once the inputs (including chips) arrive. Auto manufacturers are building partially completed cars, storing them until final inputs arrive. Its reasonable to consider that this may be the case for other consumer durable goods like gaming consoles and phones. This scenario suggests finished output could take off when key components become available. Containerships – The containerships that carry goods along the world\\'s ocean trade routes can also see shortages and gluts. An incredible surge in orders for new containerships in 2021 has come after the trade war slowdown for new orders in 2016-2020. New orders for containerships Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg data as of 11/5/2021. Orders for containerships able to carry more than 5000 Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs). What to watch Before falling sales numbers are reported, inventories begin to build up—so that is an important thing to watch for signs of investor risk. Stocks tend to react at the first sign of inventory building which we believe is unlikely to happen until sometime next year. Perhaps excess inventory is sitting at ports right now or, more likely, on order books (there may be some over-ordering taking place). While shortages can create problems, gluts can be worse. The risk of a supply glut in 2022 pulling down stock prices and depressing inflation could be one of the biggest risks for investors.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'When you’re trading options, it’s important to know what’s at stake: What is your maximum gain, maximum loss, and breakeven price on a particular options strategy? An options profit and loss calculator can help you analyze your trades before you place them. In this article, we’ll review the Trade & Probability Calculator, which displays theoretical profit and loss levels for options or stock strategies. It helps you determine the likelihood of a strategy reaching certain price levels by a set date, using a normal distribution curve. Where do I find it? The Trade & Probability Calculator is available in the All in One trade ticket on StreetSmart Edge®, circled in red in Figure 1. Figure 1. StreetSmart Edge dashboard Source: StreetSmart Edge® How does it work? To get started, you’ll want to select the Trade & Probability Calculator tab (shown in the red box in Figure 2). Then, you’ll want to verify the following graphical default profit and loss (P&L) settings: The date of entry (orange line) The halfway point (blue line) Expiration (purple line) You can change these defaults by selecting a specific date for any of the three lines. You can also view the numerical probability of reaching a specific target, above and below the current price, by expiration. To do this, move the vertical slider bars with your mouse or enter prices for the lower and upper targets (shown in the yellow box). Figure 2. Setting P&L dates and target prices to calculate probabilities in the Trade & Probability Calculator tab Source: StreetSmart Edge All option pricing inputs can be changed, which allows you to view the price levels and probabilities that are most important to you. For example, you can edit the default implied volatility, dividend yield, and interest rate settings to see how this might affect the outcomes, both numerically and graphically. Follow this example of how the Trade & Probability Calculator works in action: Suppose you’re considering the purchase of 1 IBM 11/15/2019 145 Call at a price of $3.50 when the price of IBM is $140.92 (see Figure 2). The following price calculations (shown in the purple box) are done automatically: Maximum gain (MG) = unlimited Maximum loss (ML) = premium paid (3.50 x 100) = $350 Breakeven (BE) = strike price + option premium (145 + 3.50) = $148.50 (assuming held to expiration) The maximum gain for long calls is theoretically unlimited regardless of the option premium paid, but the maximum loss and breakeven will change relative to the price you pay for the option. These values are also automatically calculated for many other option strategies although the formulas are different. Now, if you select the Trade & Probability Calculator tab, you’ll see the following additional calculations are done automatically and displayed graphically (shown in the green box in Figure 2): Probability of the option expiring below the lower slider bar. If you set the lower slider bar to 140, this would equal 1 minus the approximate Delta of a 140 strike call or (1 – .5244 = .4756 or 47.56%). Probability of the option expiring above the upper slider bar. If you set the upper slider bar to 145, this would equal the approximate Delta of the 145 call (.3762) or 37.62%. Since 145 is the call you’re considering for purchase, this is also the same as the probability of the option expiring in the money. Probability of the option expiring between the upper and lower slider bar. Assuming the two settings above, this would equal 1 minus the sum of the two previous calculations (1 – (.4756 + .3762) = .1482 or 14.82%). These probability calculations will change if you alter the lower and upper targets by either moving the slider bars with your mouse or by typing in specific values for the lower target and upper target. In Figure 2, the profit and loss calculations (shown in the blue box ) for the date of entry (orange line), the halfway point (blue line), and expiration (purple line) are estimated, assuming the price of the underlying stock remains unchanged from its current level. In this example, the 145 calls are out of the money initially, so notice how the loss increases as time elapses toward expiration; this is due to time-value erosion. You can click the Refresh button at any time to update the pricing inputs. To forecast the probabilities of the underlying stock reaching a different price on the various dates displayed, you would place your cursor anywhere on the chart and hold down the left mouse button to create crosshairs that pinpoint the forecasted price and profit and loss amount. As shown in the purple circle in Figure 3, this will calculate the probability of the option reaching that price at any time between now and expiration (“Prob. Touching”) as well as the probability of the option reaching that price level at expiration (“Prob. Expiring”). Figure 3. Using a specific option price and profit and loss amount to calculate probability Source: StreetSmart Edge In addition, you can easily make the following calculations, which many option traders find useful (see Figure 4): Probability of the option expiring below the upper slider bar. If you set the upper slider bar to 145, it would equal 1 minus the probability of the option expiring above the upper slider bar (1 – .3762 = .6238 or 62.38%). This is the same as the probability of the option expiring worthless. Probability of earning a profit at expiration, if you purchase the 145 call option at 3.50. If you set the upper slider bar to the breakeven level of 148.50, this would equal the approximate Delta of a theoretical 148.50 strike call (.2839) or 28.39% (circled in red). Note that while the option was only 4.08 points out of the money when purchased, the stock must increase by 7.58 points for the option to be profitable by expiration. This calculation estimates the approximate probability of that occurring. Probability of losing money at expiration, if you purchase the 145 call option at 3.50. Once you have set the upper slider bar to 148.50, this would equal 1 minus the probability of earning a profit at expiration (1 – .2839 = .7161 or 71.61%). As in the previous examples, you’ll note that this is essentially equal to the sum of the other two probability calculations (circled in blue) or 47.56% + 24.06% = 71.62%. Figure 4. Calculating probability of your options expiring below, at, or above your targets Source: StreetSmart Edge In Figure 5, if you zoom in on the distribution curve, you can choose a closer date for the “Probability” calculation (shown in the red box). This is helpful because it separates the visual profit and loss lines for the various dates. This will also cause the probability calculations (shown in the purple box) to be oriented to the new date you selected rather than the option’s expiration date, which is the default setting.

Calculating the probability using an earlier date Source: StreetSmart Edge As shown below in Figure 6, you can turn off any of the various visual displays (the normal distribution curve in this example) by simply clicking on the colored box next to the Probability date (circled in red). Likewise, you can turn on a visual line for the ML, BE, MG, or Std. Deviations by clicking on the colored box next to these values (circled in blue ). Figure 6. Customizing the Trade & Probability Calculator display Source: StreetSmart Edge Keep in mind While profit and loss calculations assume that option positions will be held until expiration, you can usually close long- or short-option positions prior to expiration by buying or selling them in the market. All probability calculations are based on an assumption of stable, implied volatility values. Changes in implied volatility could dramatically affect forecasts. Delta is often used as an instantaneous forecast of the approximate probability of an option contract expiring in the money. Just keep in mind that Delta is calculated continuously, so it will generally increase or decrease as the underlying stock price changes. The projections and forecasts generated by the Trade & Probability Calculator are hypothetical in nature and should not be regarded as indicative of actual investment results. Trading and investment decisions should not be based solely upon values or calculations generated by the Trade & Probability Calculator.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'If you’re like most taxpayers, there’s probably a file or folder in your home filling up with tax forms and receipts. While it might be tempting to put off the day of reckoning, April 15 will be here before you know it. The sooner you start organizing your return, the less stress you’re likely to feel as the tax filing deadline approaches. “Don’t wait until the last minute when it comes to your taxes,” says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, and director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “If you can get a head start, you can break the job up into smaller, more manageable tasks and avoid a lot of the usual anxiety.” Here’s a handy reminder of what you’ll need to prepare, along with some tips for avoiding common mistakes. Common tax forms Filing taxes usually goes hand in hand with tax forms—whether paper or electronic. Depending on your individual situation, you may receive a lot of them. That’s reason enough for starting early—if you find you’re missing one, you’ll want to give yourself plenty of time to track it down. Here are some of the most common IRS forms you may need for your taxes: W-2: Your employer will use this form to report your total annual compensation, payroll taxes, contributions to retirement accounts, and other information. 1098: This form is used by lenders to report the amount a borrower paid in mortgage interest, mortgage insurance premiums, and any points on the purchase of a new home over the past year. 1098-E: Lenders use this form to report interest they charged a borrower on outstanding student loans. 1098-T: Payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses, certain adjustments, and scholarship or grant amounts are reported on this form. 1099-B: This is the form used by financial institutions to report capital gains. 1099-DIV: This is the form used by financial institutions to report dividends. 1099-MISC: If you received income from royalties, rents, payments to independent contractors, or other miscellaneous sources, you’ll need to file this form. 1099-R: This form is used by financial institutions to report withdrawals from tax-advantaged retirement accounts. 1099-INT: Financial institutions use this form to report interest income. SSA-1099: The Social Security Administration uses this form to report Social Security benefits you’ve received. When you receive each form, check it for errors. If you find any, ask the responsible party to correct them as soon as possible, or your tax return could be held up. Planning to itemize? If your deductions exceed the standard deduction for 2021—$12,550 for single filers, $18,800 for single heads of household, and $25,100 for married filers—it makes sense to itemize them so you can keep more of your earnings. That requires proof in the form of receipts and other documentation to support your figures. You won’t need to submit the receipts with your tax return, but you’ll need to have them on hand in case you’re audited by the IRS. “You don’t want to be caught without them, so be sure to save them for at least 7 years,” Hayden says. And, he adds, “If you lost or didn’t save some of this information, don’t fret—you may be able to use other documents, such as credit card statements or canceled checks, as evidence during an audit.” Not quite ready? Sometimes filing on time just isn’t in possible. Unexpected life events can interfere with your ability to file on time, as can delays in receiving tax forms. If you can’t meet the April 15 filing deadline, you’ll need to file for an extension. As long as you do that, you’ll have until October 15 to complete your return. But keep in mind, you still need to estimate and pay any taxes you owe by the regular filing deadline to avoid possible penalties. Avoiding mistakes Finally, be mindful of common issues that often trip up taxpayers. Hayden, who spent eight years at the IRS before joining Schwab, says he saw taxpayers make the same mistakes over and over again. Among the most common mistakes are underreporting income, misreporting investment gains, claiming unsupported deductions, and entering information incorrectly. Using tax-preparation software can increase the overall accuracy of your return and help identify all the deductions you may be entitled to. But even the best tax software won’t catch basic inputting errors. If you realize you filed your return with a mistake or forgot to include something, be sure to file an amended return as soon as possible. It’s also never a bad idea to call for back-up—consider enlisting a tax professional to answer specific questions, give your return a second look, or even prepare it from start to finish.'}],\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Converting to a Roth IRA could save you money in retirement.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Does it ever make sense to pay taxes on retirement savings sooner rather than later? When it comes to a Roth Individual Retirement Account (Roth IRA), the answer could be yes. A Roth IRA is funded with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are entirely tax-free.1 Additionally, Roth IRAs aren’t subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs), which gives you greater control over your taxable income in retirement. Who can contribute to a Roth IRA? You can’t contribute to a Roth IRA if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) equals or exceeds certain limits ($140,000 for single filers and $208,000 for married couples filing jointly in 2021). But there’s a workaround: A Roth IRA conversion allows you, regardless of income level, to convert all or part of your existing traditional IRA funds to a Roth IRA. Who should consider converting to a Roth IRA? You must pay income taxes on any converted funds in the year of the conversion, but there are several scenarios in which that might be to your advantage: You believe your tax bracket will be higher in retirement. In this scenario, paying taxes at your current tax rate is preferable to paying a higher rate after you’ve stopped working. Paying higher taxes in retirement may sound farfetched, but it’s possible, especially if you haven’t yet hit your peak earning years or you’ve accumulated significant savings in your retirement accounts. It could make sense to convert all or a portion of funds in a traditional IRA to a Roth today and not in the future. You want to maximize your estate for your heirs. If you don’t need to tap your IRA funds during your lifetime, converting from a traditional to a Roth IRA allows your savings to grow undiminished by RMDs, potentially leaving more for your heirs, who can also benefit from tax-free withdrawals during their lifetimes. You don’t have much tax diversification of account types. That is, most of your assets are in tax-deferred accounts. By converting to a Roth IRA, you’ll have assets that won’t be taxed when withdrawn, potentially allowing you to better manage your tax brackets and enable more personalized tax planning during retirement. You have irregular income streams and lower than usual income this year. For example, you might own a business that generated a net operating loss from non-passive income. This could be the perfect opportunity to convert some funds to a Roth IRA with a relatively low tax impact. Who should not consider converting to a Roth IRA? For some people, sticking with a traditional IRA or other tax-deferred accounts might be a better strategy. A Roth conversion might not be the best option in the following situations: You’re nearing, or in retirement and you need your traditional IRA to cover your living expenses. In this situation, if you convert savings in an IRA to a Roth IRA but may need to spend that money soon, your assets may not have time to recoup from the taxes you would have to pay. You’re currently receiving Social Security or Medicare benefits. If a Roth conversion were to increase your taxable income, then more of your Social Security benefits would be taxed and your Medicare costs could rise. You don’t have money in your taxable account to pay the conversion tax. Preferably your taxable account has assets with a high basis or no gains that need to be taxed. If you have to pay tax due on the withdrawals to fund the conversion with savings from your IRA, it would take even longer to recoup the tax loss and may negate the benefits. You plan on giving a substantial amount of your traditional IRA to charities. You could do this by utilizing a Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD) to meet your RMD requirements. If you don’t plan on using your IRA assets yourself or passing them on to heirs, then a QCD could minimize or reduce the tax impact of RMDs. In this case, converting to a Roth IRA could be counterproductive, since you wouldn’t avoid taxes as you would with just a QCD. How do you convert to a Roth IRA? If you decide a Roth IRA conversion is right for you, you’ll need to keep three things in mind: When to execute the conversion. If you have a significant balance in your traditional IRA, you may want to carry out multiple Roth IRA conversions over several years, which we call a systematic Roth conversion plan. If done properly, a multiyear approach could allow you to convert a large portion of your savings to a Roth IRA while limiting the tax impact. For example, you might convert just enough to keep additional distributions from being taxed at the next higher tax bracket. Early in retirement—when your earned income drops but before RMDs kick in—can be an especially good time to implement this strategy. One issue to be mindful of is making Roth conversions when you are close (within two years) to filing for Medicare and Social Security. A Roth conversion could increase your Medicare premiums and the taxes you pay on Social Security benefits. How you’ll pay the resulting tax bill. We recommend paying with cash from outside your IRA for a couple of reasons: Any IRA money used to pay taxes won’t be accumulating gains tax-free for retirement, undermining the very purpose of a Roth IRA conversion. If you sell appreciated assets to pay the conversion tax, capital-gains taxes could further undermine the benefits of a conversion. Plus, if you’re under 59½ and withdraw money from a tax-deferred account, you’ll incur a 10% federal penalty (state penalties may also apply). You can’t undo a Roth conversion. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, you can no longer “recharacterize” or undo a Roth conversion. Once you convert, there’s no going back. The decision to convert to a Roth IRA doesn’t have to be all or nothing. You may find dividing your savings between a Roth and a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA and a traditional 401(k) is the optimal solution for you. Overall, converting to a Roth IRA might give you greater flexibility in managing RMDs and potentially cut your tax bill in retirement, but be sure to consult a qualified tax advisor and financial planner before making the move, and work with a tax advisor each year if you choose to put into action a multi-year systematic Roth conversion plan. 1Qualified distributions are those that occur at least five years after the account is established. At least one of the following conditions must also be met: The account holder is 59½ or older at the time of withdrawal; the account holder is permanently disabled; distributed assets (up to $10,000) are used toward the purchase or rebuilding of a first home for the account holder or a qualified family member; or withdrawals are made by the account beneficiary after the account holder’s death.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I’m 24 and have $80,000 in student loans. I haven’t been making payments during forbearance, but know I’ll have to start up again soon. I have a good job but I also have $4,000 in credit card debt and my budget is tight. Should I be trying to save for retirement while I’m also paying off my debts? —A Reader Dear Reader, Thank you for this great and timely question. With the student loan forbearance program scheduled to end in early 2022, there are millions of borrowers like you who will need to restart their payments. This can certainly be stressful, especially when you’re trying to make ends meet! The good news is that there are several steps you can take to make this more manageable, even on a limited budget. In fact, saving while paying down debt is pretty common, and waiting to pay off all your debts before investing for retirement or other goals could seriously work against you. So don’t think of saving and paying off debt as an “either/or” decision. The key is to set priorities and create a system that will allow you to get the most bang for your budget. Reacquaint yourself with your student loans Before you can prioritize, however, it’s important to refamiliarize yourself with exactly what you owe, and to whom. Go online to review your student loan balances, interest rates, terms, minimum monthly payments and repayment dates. It can be very helpful to consolidate all of this information into a spreadsheet for future reference, especially if you have several loans. In general, student loan interest rates are likely to be lower than what you’re paying on your credit card debt. If you have federal loans, rates are fixed and offer certain protections like forbearance, deferment, and forgiveness options. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program is currently being revamped to make it easier for more borrowers to be approved. You also may be able to consolidate your loans to potentially lower interest rates and payments. Also make sure that all your contact information is up to date and check to see if your loan provider is the same. Several companies dropped out of the federal student loan business in the last year, so it's possible you'll be working with a new provider. Not all debt is equal There is an important distinction between “good” and “bad” debt. High interest credit card debt is a prime example of “bad” debt. There is absolutely nothing good to be said about it. As Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet’s right-hand man, has said: “You can’t get ahead paying 18 percent.” “Good” debt, on the other hand, generally includes mortgages or student loans—provided the interest rate is low and you don’t borrow more than you can reasonably handle. Additionally, in the case of a student loan, you're investing in your future and your ability to earn a higher income. Strike a balance between debt payment and saving It can be challenging to save for your future at the same time that you're paying off your debts— but it is possible. Here’s how I suggest you prioritize while you’re doing both: Make the minimum payments toward bills after covering essentials (food, utilities, shelter, etc.); this includes student loans. Contribute enough to your company retirement plan to take full advantage of your employer match. This effectively puts more money in your pocket. Build an emergency fund to cover at least three to six months of essential expenses. Pay off your credit card balances. One approach is to start with the highest interest debt. That makes mathematical sense, but if you want a psychological boost, you could also pay off your smallest debt first. In either case, your goal is to get to a zero balance—and keep it that way. Save more for retirement. Because you’re starting in your twenties, you should be in good shape for retirement if you can save 10-15 percent of your salary throughout your working years (those who start later have to increase this percentage). To me, these four points are important for everyone. Once you’ve got them under control, you can tackle other goals according to your personal needs and preferences. Save for a child’s education (notice that retirement comes first). Save for a home. Pay down other debt, including your student loans. Save even more. Once you've met your goals for emergency and retirement funds, consider investing for other short, intermediate and long term objectives in a taxable brokerage account. Understand the difference between saving and investing As you look ahead, it’s also important to understand that saving and investing are two different things, and each is important. Saving is setting aside money and putting it in a safe place that you can access quickly—for example, in a savings account or money market account. You won’t get a big return, but when it comes to your emergency fund or any other money you'll need in the next two to three years, safety is paramount. On the other hand, when you’re preparing for a goal that’s many years out (such as retirement), it is appropriate to invest some, if not most, of your money in the stock market so it has the potential to grow and outpace inflation. If you're new to investing, don’t hesitate to consult with a financial advisor who can help you build a diversified portfolio. Make it automatic Finally, put as much as you can on auto-pay. This includes your predictable monthly bills, your student loan payments and your savings. If you make payments to a 401(k) plan, they automatically come out of your paycheck, but don’t stop there. You can set up automatic transfers from your checking to your other savings accounts as well. And once you have money to invest, you can even direct your savings automatically into a brokerage account. I give you a lot of credit for taking your student loans seriously, and for thinking about retirement this early. Paying off debt can definitely feel burdensome and less interesting than investing. But you can do both with the right strategy. You’ll then be in great shape not only to reap the benefits of your education, but also to handle whatever the future holds.

       "   'abstract': 'Learn how option Greeks can help you evaluate the risks and rewards of options contracts.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Options traders often invoke the “Greeks.” What are they, and more importantly, what can they do for you? In short, the Greeks refer to a set of calculations you can use to measure different factors that might affect the price of an options contract. With that information, you can make more informed decisions about which options to trade, and when to trade them. They are: Delta, which can help you gauge the likelihood an option will expire in-the-money (ITM), meaning its strike price is below (for calls) or above (for puts) the underlying security’s market price. Gamma, which can help you estimate how much the Delta might change if the stock price changes. Theta, which can help you measure how much value an option might lose each day as it approaches expiration. Vega, which can help you understand how sensitive an option might be to large price swings in the underlying stock. Rho, which can help you simulate the effect of interest rate changes on an option. Now that you’ve been introduced, we can explore these calculations in more detail. Delta Delta measures how much an option’s price can be expected to move for every $1 change in the price of the underlying security or index. For example, a Delta of 0.40 means the option’s price will theoretically move $0.40 for every $1 change in the price of the underlying stock or index. As you might guess, this means the higher the Delta, the bigger the price change. Traders often use Delta to predict whether a given option will expire ITM. So, a Delta of 0.40 is taken to mean that at that moment in time, the option has about a 40% chance of being ITM at expiration. This doesn’t mean higher-Delta options are always profitable. After all, if you paid a large premium for an option that expires ITM, you might not make any money. You can also think of Delta as the number of shares of the underlying stock the option behaves like. So, a Delta of 0.40 suggests that given a $1 move in the underlying stock, the option will likely gain or lose about the same amount of money as 40 shares of the stock. Call options Call options have a positive Delta that can range from 0.00 to 1.00. At-the-money options usually have a Delta near 0.50. The Delta will increase (and approach 1.00) as the option gets deeper ITM. The Delta of ITM call options will get closer to 1.00 as expiration approaches. The Delta of out-of-the-money call options will get closer to 0.00 as expiration approaches. Put options Put options have a negative Delta that can range from 0.00 to –1.00. At-the-money options usually have a Delta near –0.50. The Delta will decrease (and approach –1.00) as the option gets deeper ITM. The Delta of ITM put options will get closer to –1.00 as expiration approaches. The Delta of out-of-the-money put options will get closer to 0.00 as expiration approaches. Gamma Where Delta is a snapshot in time, Gamma measures the rate of change in an option’s Delta over time. If you remember high school physics class, you can think of Delta as speed and Gamma as acceleration. In practice, Gamma is the rate of change in an option’s Delta per $1 change in the price of the underlying stock. In the example above, we imagined an option with a Delta of .40. If the underlying stock moves $1 and the option moves $.40 along with it, the option’s Delta is no longer 0.40. Why? This $1 move would mean the call option is now even deeper ITM, and so its Delta should move even closer to 1.00. So, let’s assume that as a result the Delta is now 0.55. The change in Delta from 0.40 to 0.55 is 0.15—this is the option’s Gamma. Because Delta can’t exceed 1.00, Gamma decreases as an option gets further ITM and Delta approaches 1.00. After all, there’s less room for acceleration as you approach top speed. Theta Theta tells you how much the price of an option should decrease each day as the option nears expiration, if all other factors remain the same. This kind of price erosion over time is known as time decay. Time-value erosion is not linear, meaning the price erosion of at-the-money (ATM), just slightly out-of-the-money, and ITM options generally increases as expiration approaches, while that of far out-of-the-money (OOTM) options generally decreases as expiration approaches. Time-value erosion Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research Vega Vega measures the rate of change in an option’s price per one-percentage-point change in the implied volatility of the underlying stock. (There’s more on implied volatility below.) While Vega is not a real Greek letter, it is intended to tell you how much an option’s price should move when the volatility of the underlying security or index increases or decreases. More about Vega: Volatility is one of the most important factors affecting the value of options. A drop in Vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value. An increase in Vega will typically cause both calls and puts to gain value. Neglecting Vega can cause you to potentially overpay when buying options. All other factors being equal, when determining strategy, consider buying options when Vega is below “normal” levels and selling options when Vega is above “normal” levels. One way to determine this is to compare the historical volatility to the implied volatility. Chart studies for both values are available on StreetSmart Edge®. Rho Rho measures the expected change in an option’s price per one-percentage-point change in interest rates. It tells you how much the price of an option should rise or fall if the risk-free interest rate (U.S. Treasury-bills)* increases or decreases. More about Rho: As interest rates increase, the value of call options will generally increase. As interest rates increase, the value of put options will usually decrease. For these reasons, call options have positive Rho and put options have negative Rho. Consider a hypothetical stock that’s trading exactly at its strike price. If the stock is trading at $25, the 25 calls and the 25 puts would both be exactly at the money. You might see the calls trading at, say, $0.60, while the puts could be trading at $0.50. When interest rates are low, the price difference between puts and calls will be relatively small. If interest rates increase, the gap will get wider—calls will become more expensive and puts will become less so. Rho is generally not a huge factor in the price of an option, but should be considered if prevailing interest rates are expected to change, such as just before a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Long-Term Equity AnticiPation Securities® (LEAPS®) options are far more sensitive to changes in interest rates than are shorter-term options. Implied volatility: like a Greek Though not actually a Greek, implied volatility is closely related. Implied volatility is a forecast of how volatile an underlying stock is expected to be in the future—but it’s strictly theoretical. While it’s possible to forecast a stock’s future moves by looking at its historical volatility, among other factors, the implied volatility reflected in the price of an option is an inference based on other factors, too, such as upcoming earnings reports, merger and acquisition rumors, pending product launches, etc. Key points to remember: Figuring out exactly how volatile a stock will be at any given time is difficult, but looking at implied volatility can give you a sense of what assumptions market makers are using to determine their quoted bid and ask prices. As such, implied volatility can be a helpful proxy in gauging the market. Higher-than-normal implied volatilities are usually more favorable for options sellers, while lower-than-normal implied volatilities are more favorable for option buyers, because volatility often reverts back to its mean over time. Implied volatility is often provided on options trading platforms because it is typically more useful for traders to know how volatile a market maker thinks a stock will be than to try to estimate it themselves. Implied volatility is usually not consistent for all options of a particular security or index and will generally be lowest for at-the-money and near-the-money options. StreetSmart Edge® has charting studies for historical volatility and implied volatility. By comparing the underlying stock’s implied volatility to the historical volatility, you can sometimes get a good sense of whether an option is priced higher or lower than normal.

       "   'content': 'Tax filing season may be months away, but it’s never too early to think about implementing a tax strategy that could save you money. Before the year passes you by, consider the following questions to help ensure you’re not missing out on potential tax benefits. Questions about taxes that could save you money What are my withholdings and estimated tax payments? Have I maximized my retirement account contributions? Do I need RMDs? What is the cost basis of my investments? Are my investments tax-efficient? Have I maximized my charitable contributions? Verify withholdings and estimated tax payments Double-check your withholding and estimated tax payments to ensure you’re not over or under withholding from your paycheck. Many people think getting a big tax refund is a good thing. Unfortunately, the IRS does not pay you interest on the refund it sends you. Having too much money withheld from your paycheck—or overpaying your quarterly estimated tax payments—means you’re forgoing the potential interest or returns that money could have generated. On the other hand, withholding too little can lead to a large bill at tax time, an unpleasant surprise if you haven’t planned for it. Avoid both scenarios by checking that your withholding is appropriate. Make early retirement contributions If you have the financial means, be sure to maximize your contributions to tax advantaged accounts and consider making your 2021 contributions sooner rather than later. Even though you have until year-end to make contributions to your 401(k) or Tax Day for your traditional or Roth IRA, making early contributions to your retirement accounts will give your money more time to benefit from potential long-term compound growth. Consider required minimum distributions (RMDs) If you’re age 72 or older and have to take RMDs from your retirement accounts, you must do so before the end of the year. Otherwise, you may have to pay a 50% excise tax on the amount not distributed. If you turned 72 this year, you have until April 1 of next year to take your first RMD. However, if you wait until next year to start your RMDs, you’ll have two distributions in the same year—which might bump you into a higher marginal tax bracket. If you’re charitably inclined and don’t need the RMD for your living expenses, consider making a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) from your retirement account directly to your favorite charity. You can use a QCD to donate up to $100,000 a year and it won’t be included in your income. Understand cost basis Know your costs before you sell. Savvy investors know that their managing cost basis can help them save on taxes. Your cost basis is essentially what you paid for an investment, including brokerage fees and any other trading costs. Your capital gain (or loss) will be the difference between the cost basis of the asset and the price at which you sell it. In a simple transaction, the cost basis should be easy to calculate. However, if you buy the same investment over time—such as through a dividend reinvestment plans—each block of shares purchased is likely to have a different cost and holding period. In these situations, you can pick which shares to sell, giving you the ability to sell the ones that will have the least tax impact. Alternatively, you can go with the default method, which generally requires less effort on your part—but could cost you more in taxes. Invest tax-efficiently Make sure your assets are located in the most tax-efficient investment accounts. For example, it makes sense to hold long-term investments in a taxable account, because any gains will be taxed at the lower capital gains rate. The same is true for tax-efficient investments, such as stocks or funds that pay qualified dividends, municipal bonds, and most index funds and ETFs. On the other hand, you’re better off keeping investments you plan to hold for less than a year in tax-advantaged accounts, such as a 401(k), IRA, or Roth IRA. Remember, gains on short-term investments are taxed as ordinary income, which is subject to a higher tax rate than capital gains. The same is true for actively managed mutual funds that may generate significant short-term capital gains or the interest income on corporate bonds. Qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are tax-free,1 so it usually makes sense to use these accounts for assets that you expect will appreciate the most. Of course, tax-efficient placement presumes you have different account types. If most or all of your portfolio is in tax-deferred accounts, you’ll want to focus on your asset allocation strategy. Maximize your charitable donations If the changes within the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) made the standard deduction the best option for you, consider concentrating your donations into a single year. By giving more in one year, there’s the potential to maximize your itemized deduction for that year. The next year, you can switch and take the standard deduction, which could increase your overall deductions for that two-year period, resulting in a large tax benefit. In addition, if your charitably inclined and you’re planning on selling a significant amount of long-term appreciated stock, which will generate a large taxable gain, consider donating a portion of those assets directly to a charity. Subject to certain income limitations, you could get a tax deduction for the full fair market value of the donated stock and you won’t have to pay taxes on the gain for those shares. Many charities are unable to accept gifts of appreciated assets--like stocks or mutual funds--but you can use a donor-advised fund, which is another great tax tool to facilitate the donation process. When you place assets in a donor-advised fund, you get the full deduction for the charitable gift that year. Then, you can grant those assets to your favorite charity over time The bottom line These are just a few of the steps you can take to prepare for tax season and potentially minimize your tax bill. A qualified tax professional can help you find other effective ways to navigate tax season and answer specific tax questions based on your personal situation. After you decide what to do this year, resolve to make tax planning a year-round exercise. By looking ahead, you’ll find it easier to check your progress, update your plan and, if necessary, take action long before the tax-filing deadline. 1 Qualified distributions are tax-free for those 59 ½ or older with accounts that have been open for five years or more.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I’m making more money after recently switching jobs but still never seem to have any extra. How can I get ahead? —A Reader Dear Reader, First, congratulations on your new job. A lot of people are contemplating making a move these days, and you\\'re one of the lucky ones to have done it successfully. And there\\'s no reason not to enjoy that success by loosening up the purse strings a bit. It\\'s only natural to want to improve your lifestyle as you make more money. But along with my congratulations, I\\'ll offer a word of caution, because lurking in the shadows of your success is a very common phenomenon that can take you by surprise: lifestyle creep. Lifestyle creep happens when people increase their spending as they earn more. But it\\'s not just spending more that can trick you, it\\'s spending unconsciously. Let\\'s say your increased salary means you feel you can eat out more often. That\\'s fine. But soon you\\'re eating out several times a week at more expensive restaurants. Or maybe you can now afford a new car, but you choose a model that puts a strain on your monthly budget. The added expenses just creep up on you and before you realize it, what you thought would be extra money is already spent. But while improving your lifestyle may cost more, it doesn\\'t have to derail your ability to get ahead. Here are some ways to both enjoy your increased salary today and protect your financial future. Spend some, save some Getting ahead is all about balance. It isn\\'t realistic—or necessary—to save everything for the future. It\\'s okay to give yourself permission to enhance your everyday lifestyle a bit. A few more nights out, that new laptop you\\'ve been wanting, a nice vacation—those are all things that can add to your quality of life as long as you stay aware and in control of the costs. So plan for them, budget for them and enjoy them. At the same time, keep saving for your bigger goals like retirement, a home down payment or a child\\'s education. Be mindful about what you buy A budget gives you permission to spend a certain amount, pay close attention to what you\\'re buying and why. Before making a major purchase, ask yourself how long it will take to pay for it. Will you have to work longer? Is it worth what you\\'re paying? Will your future self think it\\'s worth it? Be wary of the buy-now-pay-later offers that seem to be everywhere. At some point, you have to pay the whole amount. Avoid impulse purchases or making a financial decision when you\\'re feeling short of time or stressed out. And, of course, avoid getting into too much debt. That\\'s another scary scenario! Watch your fixed costs Everyday discretionary expenses can add up quickly, but so can the fixed costs of upgrading your lifestyle. After all, big-ticket items can come with ongoing expenses. A larger home can mean higher property taxes and more expensive upkeep. That high-priced car can mean higher insurance and maintenance costs as well as a higher monthly payment. And don\\'t forget about smaller things like subscriptions, memberships and streaming services. Your increased income can make all these things seem like necessary additions. That\\'s the scary part of the creep—what once was a nice-to-have now becomes a necessity and soon all your money is spent on \"essentials\" that really aren\\'t essential at all. Suddenly there\\'s nothing left for savings. Which leads to my next point. Pay yourself first One of the keys to getting ahead is to pay yourself first. Simply put—save before you spend. 401(k)? Check. IRA? Check. 529 Account? Check. House down payment? Check. Whatever you\\'re saving for, make sure to tick those off before you spend on other things. In fact, list your savings goals as essentials on your monthly budget. Once those are covered, you\\'ll feel freer to spend money on something else. The 50/30/20 rule is a good guideline: spend 50 percent of after-tax income on needs, 30 percent on wants, and earmark 20 percent for savings. Make it automatic—and give yourself \\'automatic\\' increases Make saving even easier by putting it on automatic. If you have a 401(k), you probably don\\'t think twice about the monthly contribution that automatically comes out of your paycheck. So make saving for your other goals equally effortless by setting up auto payments, whether that\\'s to an IRA, a savings account—or even different savings accounts for different goals. The less you have to consciously decide what to save each month, the easier it will become. The other decision you should definitely make is to increase the amount you save every time you get a raise. Even a small percentage can add up significantly over time. Consider that an extra $100 a month at a 6 percent return in 30 years would be almost $100,000! Don\\'t try to keep up with the Joneses, Kardashians—or anyone else There\\'s a lot of hype about what people spend money on, whether it\\'s the latest real estate purchase of the rich and famous or the fabulous vacation your friend just posted on social media. Fear of missing out, envy, the desire to keep up—all these things can influence you to spend on something that doesn\\'t really matter to you. Try to keep your own goals and values front and center. Turn not spending into a positive! It\\'s not uncommon to equate being able to spend with being rich. On the contrary, saving and investing rather than spending will actually help you build wealth. So when you\\'re tempted to spend money on something you don\\'t really need and choose not to, emphasize the positive. By not spending today, you\\'ll not only be stopping lifestyle creep in its tracks, you\\'ll be giving yourself more choices down the road. And to me, using your money to create opportunity is the essence of getting ahead. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Stop orders are used most often to help protect an unrealized gain or to limit potential losses on an existing position. Here, we\\'ll discuss how to use them in your portfolio to help protect long equity positions. What are stop orders and how do I use them? Stop orders come in three main types: standard stop orders, stop-limit orders, and trailing-stop orders. Stop orders and stop-limit orders can be entered into a firm trading platform, or with a trading specialist at the firm. Trailing-stop orders are held on a Schwab server until the conditions you define are met or exceeded, and then routed as market orders for possible execution. To better understand how stop orders work, it\\'s helpful to think of the stop price as a trigger. For example, once an execution occurs at your designated trigger price, your stop order becomes a market order to buy or sell that stock at the prevailing market price. Stop orders are inactive, and hidden to the other market participants, until the trigger price is reached. Three types of stop orders Three types of stop orders Stop order Stop order > Stop-limit order Stop-limit order > Trailing stop order Trailing stop order > Stop order Offers execution protection only, not price > Stop-limit order Offers price protection only, not execution > Trailing stop order Offers execution protection only, not price > Stop order No costs if not executed > Stop-limit order No costs if not executed > Trailing stop order No costs if not executed > Stop order Tends to work well in slowly declining markets > Stop-limit order Tends to work well in slowly declining markets > Trailing stop order Tends to work well in slowly declining markets > Stop order Generally does not work well in halted or gapping markets > Stop-limit order Generally does not work well in halted or gapping markets > Trailing stop order Generally does not work well in halted or gapping markets > Stop order Must be manually canceled and re-entered > Stop-limit order Must be manually canceled and re-entered > Trailing stop order Automatically adjusts when underlying security increases in price > Source Schwab Center for Financial Research. Stop orders Stop orders (also known as stop-loss orders) and stop-limit orders are very similar, though the primary difference is what happens once the stop price is triggered. A standard sell-stop order is triggered when an execution occurs at or below the stop price. When this occurs, a market order to sell is sent to the marketplace and your position will be closed out at the next available price. Stop order example: The current stock price is $90. You want to protect against a significant decline. You could enter a sell-stop order at $85. If an execution occurs at $85 or lower, your stop order is triggered and a market order is entered to sell at the next available market price. Because the stop order is now a market order, all characteristics of market orders apply. In most cases, your stock will be sold at a price that is close to the market price at the time the stop order is triggered. However, you must remember that a stop order becomes a market order. In cases where the stock is dropping rapidly, or the stock is halted and reopens for trading, or when the stock gaps down in the morning (lower than the prior day\\'s closing price), your execution price could be significantly lower than your stop price. Stop-limit orders Stop-limit orders are used most often to sell a security at a specified limit price once the security has traded at or through a specified stop price. Therefore, it has two components: the stop price and the limit price, which may or may not be the same. Unlike standard stop orders, with a stop-limit order, you must enter both a stop price and a limit price. In most cases, the limit price on a sell stop-limit order will be equal to or below the stop price. As the stock begins to decline in value, if the stock trades at or below the stop price, the order will trigger and become a limit order to sell at the specified limit price. Because the order is now a limit order, execution cannot occur unless the position can be sold at the limit price specified (or better). After the stop price is reached, if the next available price is below your limit price, your order will not be executed unless the price increases to your limit price. All other characteristics of limit orders apply as well. To increase your chances of execution on a stop-limit order to sell, consider placing your limit price below your stop price. The farther below the stop price you place your limit price, the better chance you have of executing your order in a rapidly declining market. With any type of limit order, including stop-limit orders, you aren\\'t guaranteed execution, because the stock may trade below the limit price before the order can be filled. This often occurs when a stock is reopened for trading after being halted due to a significant news announcement, or when the stock opens for trading in the morning at a price that is much lower than the previous day\\'s closing price. When this occurs, a stop-limit order may trigger and be entered in the marketplace as a limit order, but the limit price may not be reached. Stop-limit order example: The current stock price is $90. You place a stop-limit order to sell 100 shares with a stop price of $87.50, and a limit price of $87.50. If an execution occurs at $87.50 or below, your order will be triggered and become a limit order to sell at $87.50 or higher. If the market is falling fast, your order may not be filled at all if the next trade occurred at $87.45 and the stock continued to decline. However, if you entered your order with a stop price of $87.50, and a limit price of $87, and the next trade after the $87.50 trigger was at any price above $87, your order typically would be executed. Keep in mind, your order can\\'t be executed at a price that is inferior to the best available price, even if your limit allows for it. Therefore, in a slowly declining market, your order might be filled at $87.50 or better, if market conditions allow for it. Trailing-stop order With a trailing-stop order, the stop price trails the bid price of the stock as it moves higher. The stop price essentially self-adjusts and remains below the market price by the number of points, or the percentage, that you specify, as long as the stock is moving higher. Once the stock begins to move lower, the stop price freezes at the highest level it reaches. In other words, the stop price can move higher indefinitely, but it can never move lower. If the stock falls enough to reach the stop price, the order is triggered and sent to the marketplace. The primary benefit of a trailing-stop order, versus a regular stop order, is that it doesn\\'t have to be canceled and re-entered as the price of the stock increases. As mentioned above, this order is held on a Schwab server until the stop price (trigger) is reached. Trailing-stop order example: You placed a 5% trailing-stop order on a recently purchased stock position. As the stock increases in price, if—at any point—the bid retraces (falls) by 5%, a market order will automatically be entered for the quantity you specified. For example, you entered this order when the stock price was $100 per share. If the bid price increases 9% to $109 (assuming it never pulled back 5% on its way up to $109), and then drops 5% to $103.55, the order will be sent. The effective change, from the time the trailing-stop was placed until the order was triggered, would be 3.55% above where you originally placed the order. Since a trailing-stop order becomes a market order when triggered, it behaves very similar to a standard stop order. Trailing-stop order Source: StreetSmart Edge®. Where should you set your stop order? When you place a stop, stop-limit, or trailing-stop order, you have to decide how many points, or what percentage below the stock price, to place the order. Many traders have a standard policy that they use, such as 5% or 10% below. For traders who determine the size of each trade based on the dollar amount invested, rather than the share quantity, a point value may be more effective than a percentage. Some disciplined traders follow a rule that no loss should exceed a certain percentage of their total portfolio value. For example, some traders might set this at 1% to 3% of their portfolio value, or whatever percentage they feel may be appropriate. In addition, if you\\'ve had a recent string of losses, you may want to consider keeping your stops a little closer until your success rate picks up. Regardless of what methodology you use, be careful not to place the stop price too close to the current price, or the order might be triggered by regular daily price fluctuations. Similarly, you don\\'t want to place the stop price too far from the current price, or you may sustain a sizable loss before you exit the position. One way to reduce the likelihood of either of these things occurring is to pay attention to the stock\\'s volatility. Clearly, if you\\'re trading a highly volatile stock that has a history of fluctuating as much as 5% in price daily, placing a stop order 5% below your entry price is likely to result in an unfavorable outcome. If you\\'re unwilling to assume the risk of daily fluctuations of 5%, then consider not trading that stock. By contrast, a 5% stop order may be appropriate for a stock that has a history of 5% fluctuations in a month. Using a few days of pricing data, you can calculate the average daily price change for a stock. The table below lists the hypothetical daily closing prices for XYZ stock over six consecutive trading days. As you can see, the average day-to-day closing price change for the week has been only $0.45, or about 0.82%. For the full week, the net change was only $0.28, or about 0.51%. Entering a 5%, or a three-point, stop order on XYZ stock would likely provide adequate protection and reduce the risk of being stopped out too soon.

       "   'content': 'Thanks to decades-long trends that have lowered costs for trading and increased access to the markets, it’s now easier than ever to become an investor. Some of the latest innovations include commission-free online stock trading and the introduction of fractional shares, which allow investors to buy smaller, more affordable “slices” of otherwise prohibitively priced stocks. While these developments are indeed wonderful, they don’t change a fundamental aspect of investing—namely, that investing is all about balancing the potential for making money with the possibility of losing it. Whether you’re a new investor or an experienced one, have a little bit of money or a lot, managing risk is key to success. With that in mind, here are four risk-management principles to get you started—and to stick with throughout your investing career. 1. Align your risk with your goals What are you investing for and how are you going to achieve it? To create a successful plan, you first need to identify what your goal is: a comfortable retirement, the down payment on a house, a trip you hope to take in the next few years? Once you know your goals, ask yourself how quickly you want to achieve each and how much risk you’re willing to take—financially and psychologically—to get there. Could you afford to lose much of the money you’re investing? How would you react? If the answers are “no” and “poorly,” it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t invest; it just means you should invest in ways more in line with your risk tolerance and time horizon. If you’re saving for something you’ll want or need soon—such as a down payment on a new house—you’ll probably want to invest in something relatively stable, like a money-market fund or short-term bonds. If you’re saving for a retirement that’s still decades away, you may be comfortable with a larger portion of your savings in stocks—which have historically come with more risk but also delivered higher returns—since you’ll have much longer to potentially recover from a downturn. 2. Diversify Diversification means spreading out your investments—both across different asset classes (such as stocks and bonds) and within them (such as U.S. stocks and international stocks). Each asset class plays a unique role in your portfolio. Stocks provide the potential for growth and could make up the majority of your portfolio when you’re young and have many decades to benefit from compound growth. Bonds, on the other hand, can help preserve your capital, which becomes all the more critical as you approach retirement. What’s more, asset classes don’t always move in tandem, so when one is doing poorly, another may be doing well. Holding a healthy mix of assets can help reduce the impact of any single investment on your portfolio’s performance. That said, diversification still matters even if you’re investing solely in stocks. A portfolio of 20 equities in a variety of industries, for example, is generally far less risky than a portfolio of just two. 3. Rebalance Achieving long-term investing success isn’t just a matter of creating a portfolio with the right mix of investments for your goals and time frame. As the markets rise and fall, the investments in your portfolio will grow and shrink in value—so much so that, over time, your portfolio could become either less or more aggressive than you’d intended. After a long bull run, equities could account for a much larger chunk of your overall portfolio than you’d planned—leaving you exposed to unwanted risk. This is what makes rebalancing so important. By regularly selling positions that have become overweight in relation to the rest of your portfolio and moving the proceeds to positions that have become underweight, you can bring your portfolio back to its original target allocation. It’s a good idea to do this at least once a year, and more frequently if markets are making big moves. Again, even if you invest only in a handful of individual stocks, don’t let any single name or type of stock represent too big a portion of your overall portfolio. Ask yourself what would happen financially and psychologically if your biggest position significantly declined or got wiped out altogether. If that scenario is troubling even to contemplate, then your position probably needs to be trimmed back. 4. Watch out for leverage Leverage is a strategy that uses borrowed money to increase an investment’s potential return—often through products like leveraged exchange-traded funds, futures contracts, margin loans, or options. While such products can amplify returns, they also magnify risk, making it especially easy to get into financial trouble. Indeed, some of the saddest stories involve investors who suffered catastrophic losses because leverage worked against them. Ultimately, if you don’t understand leverage, it’s best to steer clear of it altogether. Even relatively sophisticated investors should proceed with caution, lest their desire for outsize gains deliver outsize losses instead. Go slow Investing is a lifelong endeavor replete with plenty of trial and error. You can learn as you go and explore different approaches as your interests and goals change. The important thing is to diversify, rebalance regularly, and take a cautious approach to riskier practices in order to get where you’re going without undue turbulence.'},\n",

Then, any excess funds could be invested for potential growth—for two reasons: Given the likelihood that health care costs will be even higher in the future, doing all that you can to get ahead of them may be wise. Indeed, a 65-year-old couple retiring today can expect to need as much as $325,000 in savings to cover Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket costs.2 After age 65, you can use HSA funds for things other than health care. If you do so, you\\'ll pay only ordinary income tax on withdrawals with no other penalty—putting the funds on par with withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs. Add in the advantage that HSAs aren\\'t subject to required minimum distributions, and HSAs can be a compelling option for retirement savings overall. (Nonqualified withdrawals made prior to age 65 are subject to ordinary income tax plus a 20% early withdrawal penalty.) To contribute to an HSA, you must participate in an eligible high-deductible health care plan—often, but not always, offered through an employer. For an individual account, you can contribute up to $3,650 in 2022 ($7,300 for families), plus an additional $1,000 in catch-up contributions if you\\'re 55 or older. Once you have sufficient funds in the account—most require you to maintain a minimum cash balance—you can start to invest additional funds based on your risk tolerance, your time horizon, and, ideally, a diversified portfolio or other investment choices offered by your HSA administrator. 1 While HSA contributions are exempt from federal income tax, they are not exempt from state taxes in California or New Jersey. 2 Betsy Jaffe, \"Savings Needed for Medicare Beneficiaries\\' Health Expenses Declines,\" Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), 05/20/2021, https://www.ebri.org/docs/default-source/ebri-press-release/pr-1264-savingstargets-28may20.pdf?sfvrsn=5e993d2f_2.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Many people dislike thinking about taxes—so much that they ignore the topic until filing season is upon them. Unfortunately, waiting until the last minute to deal with tax matters can lead them to miss opportunities to potentially reduce their tax bill. Investors who include tax planning as part of their investing strategy could potentially see significant tax benefits over the long run, says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP® director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. You shouldn’t just be thinking about capital gains and losses. Savvy investors know how to manage the so-called “cost basis” and holding periods of their investments to help reduce gains that are subject to taxes. Knowing your cost basis can be a valuable tool. What is cost basis? Simply put, your cost basis is what you paid for an investment, including brokerage fees, “loads,” and any other trading cost—and it can be adjusted for corporate actions such as mergers, stock splits and dividend payments. This matters because your capital gain (or loss) will be the difference between the cost basis and the price at which you sell your securities. This cost is easy to calculate—if you don’t reinvest dividends or dollar-cost average when you invest. But if you buy over time, even automatically through a dividend reinvestment plan, each block of shares purchased is likely to have a different cost and holding period. Thus, you can pick and choose among the high- or low-cost, and long- or short-term, shares when you sell—and make the sale work to your best tax advantage. Alternatively, you can go with the automatic default method, which requires less effort on your part, but could cost you more in taxes. It’s also important to note that determining the cost basis for bonds can be a bit more complicated, based on whether you bought them at “par” (face value), paid a premium, or got a discount. Fortunately, bonds that are purchased from 2014 onward, are now required to have the brokerage firm provide each investor with tax documents that contain the cost basis for the asset. Reporting rules Federal tax rules require brokerage firms to report your cost basis to the IRS when you sell an investment only if that investment was purchased after one of the following dates: Equities (stocks, including real estate investment trusts, or REITs) acquired on or after January 1, 2011 Mutual funds, ETFs, and dividend reinvestment plans acquired on or after January 1, 2012 Other specified securities, including most fixed-income securities (generally bonds) and options acquired on or after January 1, 2014 Whether or not a brokerage reports your cost basis to the IRS, you’re responsible for reporting the correct amount when you file your taxes. And the cost basis method you choose to identify the shares you sell can make a big difference in the amount you end up paying. To understand why, you have to know a little about how the IRS looks at cost basis accounting. First In, First Out method The “first in, first out” (FIFO) cost basis method is Schwab’s default method for determining which assets were sold, for all investments other than mutual funds, if you don’t provide instructions to the contrary. If you purchased 1,000 shares over a number of years and you sold 100 of those shares, the FIFO method assumes that the shares you sold were the first ones purchased (the oldest shares). Generally, the shares you’ve held the longest are the ones you purchased at the lowest cost, which means the FIFO method could result in the largest gain recognized and the highest tax obligation. Specific identification method The other option with individual shares is called the “specific identification” method. The specific identification method takes a bit more effort, but it allows you to select the shares that are sold and gives you the most flexibility and potentially the lowest tax liability. Let’s look at an example of how specific identification works. Say you bought 500 shares of XYZ Corp. 10 years ago for $10 a share ($5,000 total), and you paid a $50 brokerage commission for a total cost of $5,050 ($10.10 a share). Several years later, you bought a second group of 500 shares for $60 a share ($30,000 total) and paid a commission of $10, for a total of $30,010 ($60.02 a share). Now, let’s say this stock has continued to appreciate in value, and each share is now worth $100. You want to liquidate 100 shares (assuming a $10 commission on the sale). Depending on which method you use, you could owe taxes on $8,980 in gains or on just $3,988 in gains. (See the table below for details.) Calculate cost with care to pay less tax Calculate cost with care to pay less tax By specifically identifying the shares you want to sell, in this hypothetical example, you would owe much less in capital gains tax. Comparison of capital gains calculated using “first in, first out” (FIFO) cost basis method and the specific identification cost Method Cost Proceeds Capital gain FIFO $1,010(100 shares x $10.10/share) $9,990 $8,980 Specific ID $6,002(100 shares x $60.02/share) $9,990 $3,988 Source Schwab Center for Financial Research. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. Identifying shares How do you identify the specific shares you want to sell? If you’re placing the order by phone, tell your broker which shares you want to sell (for example, “the shares I bought on July 5, 2012, for $11 each”). At Schwab, if you place the order online, you’ll see your cost basis method on the order entry screen. If you select the “specified lots” method, you’ll be able to specifically identify which lots you want to sell. Cost basis options for mutual funds Mutual fund investors have one additional cost basis method they can use called “average cost, single category.” This method determines your transaction’s cost basis by taking the average cost of all the shares you own and multiplying it by the number of shares you’re selling. This method provides the simplest way to handle mutual fund sales when you’re reinvesting dividends and/or regularly adding to your holdings. There is one major downside to using the average cost method. If you choose this method for your first sale, you must continue to use it for every subsequent sale for shares that were acquired before that sale date. Whereas, opting for specific identification would allow you to pick and choose which shares to sale, potentially saving you money. Say, for example, that you buy mutual fund shares each month through an automatic investment plan. One month the shares might be up; the next month they might be down. You pay little mind and just invest the same amount each month, a process called “dollar-cost averaging.” Let’s look at an example of how this works. Say you have 1,000 shares of a mutual fund and your lowest-cost shares were purchased for $10, your highest-cost shares were purchased for $100 and your average cost per share is $50. Today the market value of your mutual fund shares is $60, and you want to sell 100 shares. We’ll ignore commissions here to keep it simple. Let’s compare the three ways your cost basis could be calculated (FIFO, average cost, and specific identification) and see what the taxable gain is in each hypothetical scenario. Your cost basis can help you book a gain or loss Your cost basis can help you book a gain or loss Comparison of capital gain/loss among FIFO, average cost single category, and Specific ID methods Method Purchase price Sale price Capital gain/loss FIFO $10 $60 $5,000($50 x 100 shares) Average cost, single category $50* $60 $1,000 ($10 x 100 shares) Specific ID $100 $60 -$4,000(-$40 x 100 shares) Source Schwab Center for Financial Research. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. *The average price per fund share at time of sale As you can see in the table above, depending on the cost basis method you choose, your taxable gain or loss can vary greatly. Each of these transactions results in the same pre-tax cash flow of $6,000. However, depending on your particular situation, the money you have left in your pocket after taxes could be quite different in each method. So, which method should you choose? One cost basis method is not necessarily better than another since each has its benefits and down sides. Choosing the best cost basis method depends on your specific financial situation and needs. If you have modest holdings and don’t want to keep close track of when you bought and sold shares, using the average cost method with mutual fund sales and the FIFO method for your other investments is probably fine. But if you’re a tax-sensitive investor, specific identification could potentially save you a lot in taxes—especially if you use other tax-smart strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting, tax-gain harvesting, or donating appreciated assets to your favorite charity. Whichever method you decide to use, it’s important to plan ahead so you aren’t stuck with a huge tax bill come filing season.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The desire to get your money’s worth can lead you in some potentially harmful directions.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Always wanting to get your money’s worth seems like a reasonable way of thinking about costs and experiences. When you pay for something, you expect to get something in return. If you don’t, you feel like you’ve thrown away your money, time, or effort. But even getting your money’s worth has its limits. Imagine, for example, that you shelled out for some luxurious grass-fed organic milk. You’re just about to start foaming it up for a latte when you realize it has expired. Do you press on, thinking about the high price you paid when you bought the milk? Or do you pause, thinking about the unpleasant drinking experience ahead? Life is full of situations like this. Unfortunately, they aren’t always as easy to parse as a decision not to drink spoiled milk. If you’ve ever sat through a football game in the freezing cold just because you paid for the ticket, then you’ve already wrestled with this problem. At issue here is a behavioral tic known as the sunk cost fallacy. Understanding how it works and avoiding its most pernicious effects can help make you a better steward of your resources. Sunk costs A sunk cost is one you’ve already paid and can’t be recovered. A rational take on such outlays would be: Money I’ll never recover won’t dictate my future decisions. Only additional costs matter. If I throw $100 into a wishing well and my wish isn’t granted, why should I toss another $100 after it? Yet sunk costs influence decisions all the time. Whenever you hear a politician railing against a project being canceled just because of the millions already spent, you’re in the presence of the sunk cost fallacy. In fact, this problem is occasionally referred to as the “Concorde fallacy,” after the now-scrapped supersonic jet that once flew between Europe and the United States. The British and French governments continued to spend money on the project long after they knew the economic rationale for it was dead. The sums they’d already spent on the Concorde became a justification to keep spending more—the very definition of throwing good money after bad. So, what’s going on here? Waste not Researchers have shown how people will subordinate their pleasure if it means avoiding waste. One study offered up the following problem: Imagine you bought a $100 ticket for an upcoming ski trip to Michigan.1 A few days later, you spend another $50 booking a potentially more enjoyable ski trip to Wisconsin. To your dismay, you realize they are on the same weekend. It’s too late to sell, and the tickets are nonrefundable. Where do you ski? The rational choice would be to accept that you can’t get your money back and opt for the more enjoyable trip to Wisconsin. However, most of the subjects participating in the experiment opted for Michigan—apparently because that ticket cost more. Why would the cost outweigh the average skier’s better interest? Groundbreaking research by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky has shown that humans are imperfect judges of self-interest and have a strong aversion to loss.2 In fact, we tend to feel the pain of losses even more keenly than the pleasure of gains. In the case of the sunk-cost fallacy, the fear of acknowledging a “loss” can keep us looking backward at events we can’t change, when our interest lies in thinking about what comes next. Investing Investing is inherently forward-looking. Whether you’re saving money in a savings account, putting it in the stock market, or investing in your own business, you’re likely thinking about accumulation, future gains, and growth. Sometimes these investments don’t pan out. That can hurt, but what you do afterward matters a lot. Throwing more money at a losing investment, trading strategy, or business idea in the hope of justifying money already spent can open the way to bigger losses. This doesn’t mean you should become so indifferent to losses that you take on excessive risk. However, it’s important to always judge your investments according to their future usefulness or prospects, and not your past feelings about them. Don’t let the sunk cost fallacy transform that albatross around your neck into a Concorde. In that spirit, here are a few tips to consider: Review your investing strategy at least once a year. Most investments aren’t “set it and forget it,” so you need to make sure your strategy is hitting the marks you’ve laid out for it. Are you still on track? Don’t stick with a strategy just because it worked in the past. Markets change. You can become more—or less—willing to take risks. Your needs can change over time. What worked before might not cut it anymore. Make sure your investments are geared toward the future, not the past. Talk with a professional if you’re not sure. Take a hard look at any losing investments and ask whether you could do better elsewhere. When you stick with a losing asset or investment strategy, you’re not just committing to a position that isn’t working—you’re also sacrificing the potential gains you could have earned with a different approach. Commit to a plan when trading. Avoiding the sunk cost fallacy can be challenging when markets are moving quickly and a trade moves against you. One way to stay disciplined is to draft a trading plan ahead of time outlining what you’re trying to accomplish and how you are going to accomplish it. Key elements of your trade plan should include your investing time horizon, entry and exit strategies, position size and trade performance review. Remember, trading involves losses. The goal is not to win on every trade, but to have more profitable trades than unprofitable trades—in other words, to make more on your winners than you lose on your losers. Use specific order types to exert more control over your trades. Consider using limit orders, or stop or stop-limit orders to help bring more discipline to your trading. Each order type can be used in particular market conditions to meet certain goals, such as executing trades at prices you specify when markets get volatile. Recognize the value in losses. If you have a losing investment in a taxable account, think before you double down. Assets that have lost value can be used to reduce your tax liability through a process known as tax-loss harvesting. This involves selling a losing investment to offset taxable gains elsewhere in your portfolio and buying back a comparable, but not identical position. 1Hal R.

       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, It’s the rare person who doesn’t occasionally fall into some poor financial habits that can lead to potentially scary results. This Halloween, make sure you’re not tricking yourself into a financial bind. Rather, treat yourself to greater security by reviewing these 10 personal finance “gotchas” and making any necessary changes. The results can be better than chocolate! 1) Trick: Assuming your money is going where you want it to go You’re making ends meet, so you’re on top of your money—right? Maybe not. Money has a sneaky way of slipping away if you’re not careful. Treat: Instead of making assumptions, make a budget. Start with two lists: your necessary monthly expenses and your nice-to-haves. Can you cover both with your income? If not, get out the red pen and start crossing off some of the extras. You don’t have to give them up completely; just save in advance. Then when you want to treat yourself, you’ll enjoy it even more knowing you’ve got it covered. 2) Trick: Thinking a financial emergency won’t happen to you Unexpected expenses can creep up on you, even if you’re young and healthy. A job loss? An accident? It may not happen, but it could—and it could cost you big time if you’re not prepared. Treat: Build an emergency fund. Aim to cover three-to-six months of essential living expenses by setting aside cash in an easily accessible savings or money market account. You don’t have to do it all at once. Just make your emergency fund a line item on your budget, and save what you can each month until you reach your goal. 3) Trick: Confusing good and bad debt Debt—like a mortgage or a student loan that’s low interest, possibly tax-deductible, and used for a potentially appreciating asset—can actually work in your favor. That’s the good kind. Credit cards and other high-interest, non-deductible consumer debt? Even though it’s convenient, that definitely falls into the “bad” category. Treat: Don’t charge more on your credit cards than you can pay off each month. Create a plan to tackle any balances. Start by paying as much as you can on the highest interest debt while always making at least minimum payments on the others. Work your way down until your credit card balances are paid off—and stay that way. 4) Trick: Not checking your credit score A low credit score can have serious repercussions, from higher interest rates and points on a loan to impacting your ability to rent an apartment—or even get a job. Treat: Go to annualcreditreport.com once a year to get a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and Transunion). If you’re in the low zone, there are positive steps you can take: pay your bills on time; keep your credit card balances low; establish a long credit history; minimize new credit requests; or use different types of credit. 5) Trick: Losing track of bank fees ATM fees, account fees, foreign transaction fees—they can definitely catch you unaware. And they can add up quickly. Treat: Review your statements so you know exactly what you’re being charged. If you’re unpleasantly surprised by the fees you’re paying, talk to your bank. Still unhappy? Change banks. There are many no-fee options out there. 6) Trick: Being complacent about retirement savings Don’t assume you’re okay just because you’re putting some money aside. With more people living into their 90s, there’s a real risk of outliving your money if you’re not prepared. Treat: Crunch the numbers so you’re sure you’ll have the nest egg you want. If you’re contributing to a 401(k), great—but it may not be enough. Use an online retirement calculator to help you figure out timing and how much to save each month. Get started early. And give yourself an extra edge by putting all your contributions on automatic. Need more help with number crunching? Consider working with a professional advisor to develop a personalized plan. 7) Trick: Under or over insuring Saving on premiums may seem smart now, but what’s the ultimate cost if you don’t have enough insurance when you need it? On the other hand, if you’re paying for insurance you don’t need, you’re also losing out. Treat: Check to make sure your coverage and plans for medical, auto, homeowners/rental, or disability insurance are still right for you. Be sure to take full advantage of all your employee benefits. And don’t be lured into buying unnecessary insurance for risks that you can handle more cost-effectively on your own (for example, pet insurance with lots of exclusions and high deductibles). 8) Trick: Confusing saving and investing Just because you have money in a 401(k) doesn’t mean that it’s invested. You have to take action to make your money grow. Treat: Long-term investing in the stock market is one of the best ways to grow your savings. The key is to invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and cash that are appropriate for your time frame and feelings about risk—and never try to time the market or bet on a single stock. A 401(k) that offers target date retirement funds is one easy way to get started. 9) Trick: Taking Social Security too early You can file for Social Security as early as age 62, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best choice for you. In fact, it could mean you’ll collect considerably less over time. Treat: Don’t jump to collect Social Security benefits earlier than you have to. If you file before what the SSA considers your full retirement age (FRA), your benefits will be permanently reduced. And for every year you wait past your FRA until age 70, you’ll get an 8% increase. That can make a huge difference, especially if you enjoy a long life. 10) Trick: Ignoring your estate plan You may have an estate plan in place, but when was the last time you looked at it? And if you don’t have one already, the trick could be not only on you but also on your heirs. Treat: Set up at least a basic estate plan, including naming a guardian for any minor children and an advance healthcare directive. Once you have a plan in place, be sure to review and update it periodically to reflect any significant life changes such as marriage, divorce, or additions to the family. Unlike Halloween candy, these financial treats aren’t just a one-time indulgence. They can set you up with a sweet financial situation to savor for years to come. Happy Halloween!

       "   'content': 'Cyber fraud may be as old as the internet itself, but it’s also a growth industry. In 2020, the FBI recorded 792,000 cybercrime complaints in the U.S. alone—a 69% increase over 2019. Losses from those frauds totaled $4.2 billion. “The pandemic has given bad actors a lot of new opportunities,” says Peter Campbell, director of Schwab’s Financial Crimes Risk Management division. “More of our lives are being conducted online than ever before, without our having thought through the security implications of that change.” While the best practices for keeping your accounts safe are ever evolving, they boil down to common sense and a healthy dose of suspicion when living and working online. With that in mind, here are 10 tips for keeping cyber criminals at bay. 1. Think before you click More than 3 billion emails pretending to be from individuals or entities that recipients know and trust are sent every day, according to the cybersecurity firm Valimail. One wrong click could drain a financial account, expose you to identify theft, or install malware on your device. “These so-called phishing scams successfully trick too many people into revealing highly sensitive information, including credit card information and passwords,” says Joel Sauer, director of senior and vulnerable investor investigations in Schwab’s Financial Crimes Risk Management division. “If you get an email you’re not expecting, don’t click on any links or accept any offers.” Here are a few simple ways to confirm the legitimacy of the source: Double-check the email address, which can differ by just a single character from an account you know. Hover your cursor over any links—without clicking—which will reveal the underlying URL (that may or may not jibe with the one it’s purporting to be). Activate your email program’s spam filters, which have become adept at separating out suspicious and unsolicited emails. “Above all, call the company back at a known or publicly listed number rather than risk responding directly to a fraudster,” Joel says. Beyond email, be aware of other forms of attack—including fraudulent SMS texts (a.k.a. “smishing”), voice calls (“vishing”), and “spear phishing,” or the practice of mining social media posts for personal information to create more targeted and potentially convincing emails. If you suspect an email that appears to be from Schwab is a phishing email, forward it to phishing@schwab.com.

Step up your security Financial firms, in particular, have implemented security features aimed at preventing cybercrime. Chief among them: Security alerts via email or text that can notify you of everything from individual transactions to changes to your password and other vital information. Two-factor authentication, which typically involves sending a randomly generated number to your phone or email, which you must enter before you can access the account. “That extra step alone can be critical to preventing unauthorized access to your accounts,” Peter says. Sign up for security alerts and two-factor authentication for your Schwab accounts. Sign up for security alerts and two-factor authentication for your Schwab accounts.

Be password smart “The first rule of passwords is: Never share passwords,” says Joel. And while most people know not to use simple passwords like “1234” or their birthday, consider creating strong, hard-to-guess passwords that don’t use personal information. Password managers can create, store, and even autofill unique passwords for as many sites as you choose. Whether you opt for a password manager or not, be sure to password-protect your laptop, phone, and tablet, as well. “These days, there is no greater repository of personal information than our devices,” Joel says. 4. Keep your devices up to date Most desktop and mobile operating systems—as well as individual applications—offer periodic updates, which frequently include security patches as new vulnerabilities are discovered. You can typically authorize automatic updates through the application’s or operating system’s settings. Failing to do so can be costly—as up to 143 million customers of one credit reporting agency learned the hard way in 2017 when their Social Security numbers, birthdates, and home addresses were exposed though a security hole for which a software patch had been issued months earlier. And finally, when it comes time to discard old gear, don’t forget to restore the device to factory settings in order to securely remove all personal data. 5. Fortify your home network Don’t overlook the internet connection that powers your home. Newer routers—devices that stream data from your internet provider to your various devices—tend to have stronger encryption settings and offer automatic updates, which manufacturers may discontinue for older models. Your router, too, should be secured with a strong password—as should internet-enabled doorbells, speakers, thermostats, and other smart devices, whose default passwords are often as simple as “password.” 6. Protect yourself in public Cyber criminals can easily set up a decoy Wi-Fi network containing the name of the airport, hotel, or restaurant from which you’re trying to connect. One way to avoid falling victim to fraudsters when accessing the internet in public is to tether your laptop or tablet to a “personal hotspot”—a feature of many smartphones. In a pinch, you can safely use public Wi-Fi for innocuous tasks like checking sports scores—but avoid logging in to financial, shopping, and other sensitive accounts. 7. Talk with your children … While most children grow up with the internet, they may not be aware of its potential pitfalls or their own vulnerabilities to them. Start early—and be frank about the risks involved and your own experiences online. “I have two teenagers, and I’m constantly preaching the gospel of online safety,” Peter says—including not giving anyone your name, the name of your school, or your home address and never agreeing to meet anyone in person who you’ve only ever met online. “They’re as much of a target as anyone else.” 8. … and elderly relatives, too Cognitive decline and social isolation, in particular, can leave the elderly susceptible to scams. “Many people were more isolated during the pandemic than ever before,” Joel says. “As a result, they were that much more vulnerable to scammers trying to form an emotional attachment over the phone or online.” Joel recommends framing conversations about cyber fraud in ways that don’t question a loved one’s judgment. “Talk about the steps you take, not the steps they should take,” he says. Above all, offer a helping hand. “Everyone needs a family member, a friend, or even a trusted financial advisor they can call with questions,” he says. What’s more, most financial institutions encourage all clients to establish a “trusted contact”—someone with whom your financial institution can discuss any signs of financial exploitation. “Even if you have a spouse listed on the account, a trusted contact can provide an additional person to contact in case of suspicious activity,” Joel says. Add or change a trusted contact for your Schwab accounts. Add or change a trusted contact for your Schwab accounts. Add or change a trusted contact for your Schwab accounts. 9. Stay informed Sign up for the latest consumer-fraud alerts from the Federal Trade Commission. “It’s also a good idea to check your credit report for suspicious activity at least annually,” Peter says. You are entitled to a free annual credit report from each of the three credit reporting agencies—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—with whom you can dispute any errors or unauthorized activity. You might also consider instituting a “credit freeze” for yourself and your family members with each of the three agencies, which can prevent new accounts that require a credit check from being opened in your name without your express permission. 10. Follow your instincts “If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is,” Peter says. And no reputable company will reach out electronically to request sensitive personal information, so that’s another red flag. “To my mind, you have to do all you can to prevent fraud—but you also have to be ready to mitigate the consequences,” Joel adds. “The key is to remain vigilant so all this wonderful new access and technology isn’t used against you.” Fighting back What to do if you’re a victim of cybercrime.

       "   'content': \"After years of diligent saving, many retirees may be unsettled by the notion of actually tapping their portfolios. When should you start? How much is too much? What if you outlive your money? These are legitimate concerns, but by focusing solely on drawdowns, you could be overlooking other risks to the longevity of your savings. Let’s take a look at three common mistakes that can negatively impact your retirement income—and what to do about each. Mistake #1: Selling assets in a downturn If your first few years of retirement coincide with a market decline, it may seem that you’d need to sell more of your assets to meet your retirement income goal—leaving you with fewer shares and limiting your portfolio’s ability to recover during a potential market rally. If the decline is particularly steep or lasts for an extended period, it’s even harder to bounce back. If a similar decline occurs later in your retirement, on the other hand, you may not need your portfolio to last as long or continue growing to fund a long retirement, so you may be in much better shape to fund withdrawals. Timing is everything This chart looks at how two retirees with identical portfolios and annual withdrawals could see very different results depending on when a market downturn occurred. This chart is hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. Both hypothetical investors had a starting balance of $1 million, took an initial withdrawal of $50,000 and increased withdrawals 2% annually to account for inflation. Investor 2's portfolio assumes a negative 15% return for the first two years and a 6% return for years 3–18. Investor 1's portfolio assumes a 6% return for the first nine years, a negative 15% return for years 10–11 and a 6% return for years 12–18.1 So, what’s an investor to do? I suggest two courses of action: Adjust your allocation: Consider moving a portion of your assets into investments that are more likely to weather market disruptions. We suggest that retirees keep a portion of their retirement portfolio in cash or cash alternatives and use that to help fund expenses. Then, consider allocating some to less-volatile investments, such as high-quality short-term bonds or short-term bond funds. This can help reduce the risk in a downturn and can be especially important early in retirement. Stay flexible: Regardless of when a downturn occurs, it’s important to remain flexible with your spending plan. If you’re able to reduce your spending and/or delay large purchases, your portfolio will tend to have a better chance of enduring a decline. Mistake #2: Collecting Social Security too early It’s the age-old question: When should I start collecting Social Security? Many Americans opt to collect as soon as they become eligible at 62, but taking benefits before you reach full retirement age (from 65 to 67, depending on your birth year) means settling for smaller payments—for life. If you are in good health, have a spouse, and are able to wait even a few years longer, you stand to receive a much larger monthly check as the table below shows. Delayed gratification Individuals who collect Social Security beginning at age 62 receive 25% less in monthly benefits than if they had waited until full retirement age (FRA)—and roughly 43% less than if they had waited until age 70. Source: Social Security Administration. Benefits are based on FRA for individuals born after 1954 and assume no inflation increases. For illustrative purposes only. Waiting to collect can also help extend the life of your portfolio. True, you’ll have to rely on your savings alone if you retire several years before you start collecting Social Security, but the increased income that comes with deferral—which is guaranteed for as long as you live—can help preserve your portfolio later. Furthermore, unlike most other retirement income sources, your Social Security benefit is adjusted upward in response to inflation—so bigger checks mean bigger cost-of-living adjustments. Of course, delaying benefits is feasible only if you don’t require the income right away, so discuss your income needs and longevity expectations with a financial planner. Mistake #3: Creating an inefficient distribution strategy When it’s time to turn your retirement savings into income, it might not be as simple as selling investments and pocketing the proceeds. Rather, using your assets to support you in retirement should take into account not only your income needs but also timing, taxes, life expectancy, and account types, particularly the way withdrawals from different types of accounts or securities are taxed. Keep a close eye on taxes and timing—especially once you reach age 72 (70½ if you turned 70½ in 2019 or earlier). That’s when the required minimum distributions (RMDs) the IRS obliges you to take from your 401(k)s and SEP, SIMPLE, and traditional Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) kick in. For example, if RMDs push up your taxable income, you could end up paying more on your regular income and Social Security benefits as well as possibly owing taxes on the long-term capital gains and qualified dividends in your nonretirement accounts. This is where a retirement income plan and tax-efficient distribution strategy can help. For example, some retirees might choose to take withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts like traditional IRAs prior to age 72—when they have more flexibility to decide how and when to take distributions—in order to help manage the size of the balance held in retirement accounts and, in turn, the amount of tax on RMDs in the future. Keep in mind that withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts prior to age 59½ may be subject to an additional 10% penalty, so it’s usually best to try to avoid withdrawals prior to that age. Other retirees may opt to convert some of their retirement assets into Roth IRAs,2 which are not subject to annual RMD requirements. It’s helpful to remember, you can’t control markets and how they perform. But retirees do have more control over fees, taxes, and the timing of withdrawals. Whatever you decide, make sure to work with a financial planner and tax advisor to think through the details of your distribution plan. 1Does not reflect expenses, fees or taxes. 2A Roth IRA conversion results in taxation of any untaxed amounts in the traditional IRA and requires a five-year holding period before earnings can be withdrawn tax-free; subsequent conversions will require their own five-year holding period. In addition, earnings distributions prior to age 59½ are subject to an early-withdrawal penalty.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The pandemic has wrought havoc on the global system of trade. What does that mean for the markets and the holiday shopping season?',\n",
       "   'content': 'Supply chains typically aren’t something the average person needs to think about too much. When they’re working, these high-tech, globalized networks of parts suppliers, assemblers, shippers, and distributors allow companies to make and move goods around the world so quickly and cheaply that it’s tempting to take them for granted. That is, until a pandemic hits and exposes the fragility of this whole enterprise. Early on, essentials such as toilet paper, surgical masks and nitrile gloves suddenly became unavailable as surging demand gave way to panic-buying and hoarding. Later in the pandemic, lumber shortages caused wild price spikes, ruining many COVID-era home-improvement projects. More recently, news headlines report how a semiconductor shortage is driving up the price of consumer electronics and cars. With retailers’ deadlines for ordering and stocking goods for the holiday season rapidly approaching, it’s possible shoppers just won’t be able to get everything on their list this year. To be clear, this isn’t likely to become the new normal—though, when it might end is still uncertain. Many familiar features of modern life are implicated: Global shipping, COVID-linked worker shortages, extreme demand for limited supplies leading to price surges and inflation, and bigger transformations in our economy, including the shift to working from home, the rise of electric cars, and the potential for new infrastructure spending. So, the question now is what—if anything—can the average shopper or investor do in response? What’s wrong with the supply chain? Starting in the 1970s, the rise of the shipping container revolutionized global trade. These standard-sized corrugated steel boxes can stack on ships and fit on truck beds—and dramatically lowered the cost and time to transport goods. This enabled businesses to shift production to lower-cost destinations overseas and source materials and components from just about anywhere. The steady and stable flow of inputs led companies to adopt lean “just-in-time” manufacturing, a system under which parts and materials are timed to arrive from suppliers right when they’re needed for production. This was another savings strategy, aimed at cutting the cost to store inventory. While these developments helped make many goods more affordable, the system wasn’t prepared for the shock of COVID. Pandemic-linked shutdowns and layoffs, port closures, and disruptions in demand helped drive the biggest drop in global merchandise trade on record in the second quarter of 2020, according to the World Trade Organization.1 While the situation improved through the spring of this year, it took a turn for the worse this summer. A traffic jam at America’s busiest ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together process more than a third of U.S. goods imports, is the headline problem now. “After dropping to less than 10 in June, the number of ships waiting in San Pedro Bay to unload peaked at 73 on Sept. 19. By the end of September there were still 67,” says Jeffrey Kleintop, Schwab’s chief global investment strategist. “Most were coming from China and took about 14 days to cross the Pacific—but then had to wait as long as several weeks for an opportunity to unload and get put on trucks.” Shortages of longshoremen and truckers to haul goods to their final destinations are the primary culprits here. The backlog has pushed shipping costs to extreme levels, with the spot rate for a 40-foot shipping container from Shanghai to Los Angeles rising from about $3,500 last year to $12,500 as of the end of September. Shipping costs have exploded Source: WCIDSHLA Index. Schwab Center for Financial Research, using data from Bloomberg as of 10/1/2021. This comes as U.S. producers are already struggling to meet the strong recovery in demand for all kinds of goods after multiple rounds of government stimulus, high prices for raw materials, and worker shortages—just in time for the holiday shopping season. “This year, suppliers need to deliver their holiday-season inventory to Amazon by November 15,” Jeffrey says. “With two weeks of transit time from the point of manufacture, plus several weeks sitting at port to unload, it could already be too late for some producers to meet the deadline.” Impact on investors Supply chain problems can increase risks to corporate sales, manufacturing production and consumer inflation. “Analysts have been rapidly raising their earnings per share forecasts in recent months, after second-quarter results widely exceeded expectations,” Jeffrey notes. “Better forecasts have been supporting stocks’ historically high valuations. But as growth momentum slows and risks rise, stocks could be vulnerable to a pullback in the short term.” Because our economy is so dependent on trade, few sectors of the stock market are immune to these risks, though some, such as financials and utilities, may be better placed than others. “The consumer discretionary sector faces the strongest headwinds, as these companies—including car, home appliance, apparel and luxury brands—tend to be the biggest importers,” says David Kastner, senior investment strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “But any industry that needs imported machinery, electronics, or semiconductors, in particular, faces a potential revenue hit from supply chain problems.” Longer-term trends in our economy are also contributing to increased demand for goods already in short supply. For example, as more people work from home, more workers will need computer hardware upgrades. The 5G buildout means communications services companies need more routers and other gear. The health care sector relies on imported drugs and medical equipment. The industrials sector needs machinery for construction, which also bears on real estate and, potentially, any new infrastructure spending that comes out of Congress this year. “It might seem dire, but it’s worth noting that some of the current backlog is linked to the seasonal surge in shipping before the holidays, and business leaders are saying they expect things to improve,” David says. “Markets look forward, and even now are looking beyond this crunch. Share prices already reflect a lot of this optimism, although they could decline if the difficulties last longer than expected.” Given the breadth of the impacts across sectors, it may not be possible to completely insulate your portfolio from supply chain problems. However, investors looking to partially offset some of this risk could consider European stocks. “Europe could dodge the worst of this situation for three reasons,” says Jeffrey. “First, European business leaders made relatively fewer mentions of shortages hurting their businesses over the summer than their U.S. counterparts. That means less risk to sales.” “Second, Europe’s supplier delivery times improved slightly over the summer, while those in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan worsened. That means less production risk,” he adds. “Finally, inflation pressures are lower in Europe than in the U.S.” What can shoppers do? The situation for shoppers is a little different, as looking ahead isn’t always an option for certain purchases. “Supply chain crunches and general inflation create similar problems, practically speaking,” says Chris Kawashima, CFP®, a senior research analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “Prices have gone up, so what do you do? Essentially, these are cashflow and budgeting issues.” The first thing is to try to determine whether a price increase is transitory or something you’ll need to adjust for permanently. If it’s transitory and the item you’re looking to buy is a “want” more than a “need,” can you wait it out? If it’s a “need,” can you make it work with your budget, or do you need to adjust? Chris identifies three budgetary levers you can manipulate in response to supply chain dislocations: Cut spending elsewhere. If the cost of a necessity or even a strong “want” has gone up significantly, you could consider reducing spending in other areas. Is there another “want” you can sacrifice? Add income. Do you have options for putting more spending power behind your budget? Work with your existing budget. Can you buy less of an item or an alternative without cutting spending elsewhere? “That last point is actually where you can get pretty creative without disrupting your budget,” Chris says. “For example, maybe you could consider used items instead of new. Look for sales. Or if you have a few extra dollars, maybe bring some of your future purchases forward, especially if it means getting a discount. If you normally buy a month’s supply of something, consider buying a three months’ supply in bulk if the price is right.” The final step is just to acknowledge that supply chain problems could put more demands on your dollars in the coming months, so it could be worth it to increase your cash cushion. 1“Trade shows signs of rebound from COVID-19, recovery still uncertain,” World Trade Organization, 10/6/2020.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'What to know about the market’s two most volatile trading hours.',\n",
       "   'content': 'If the first and last hours of the trading day seem like the most hectic, it’s because they are. On a typical day, more shares trade hands in the first hour than during any other, as orders placed when the market was closed are processed. Volume tends to pick back up at the end of the day, as institutional investors look to close out positions or enter new ones. Higher volume is generally good for active traders: More shares are available to trade, and that extra liquidity leads to tighter bid-ask spreads (that is, the difference between the highest price someone is willing to pay for a share, and the lowest price someone is willing to accept to sell it). But if you’re not careful, trades can quickly move against you, which is why most long-term investors should consider trading near the middle of the day, when conditions are generally calmer. Even seasoned traders can find buying and selling near the opening and closing bells a bit like surfing when waves are biggest—if you misread the conditions, you can easily get hurt. What’s more, the spikes in volume at these times happen for fundamentally different reasons, so strategies that help you successfully navigate the market’s open may work against you at its close. After the opening bell The surge in volume at the start of the day doesn’t necessarily mean prices become more volatile. Buyers and sellers can balance each other out, creating a kind of equilibrium. But when news breaks outside of trading hours, an imbalance between buy and sell orders may cause a stock to open dramatically higher or lower than its price at the previous close. A stock hit by negative news often “gaps lower,” or opens much lower than it closed. In these cases, the stock tends to continue falling for the first five to 10 minutes as traders join the selling. This is typically followed by a recovery period for the next 20 minutes or so, as the overnight gap is “filled” as transactions go through and bargain-hunters step in (unless the news pushing the stock lower is truly disastrous). That initial fall can be alarming, especially if you’re long the stock— meaning you bought it with the expectation that its price would rise—but don’t overreact. It may be best to wait to see if it’s going to keep falling or start rallying. One way to protect yourself against further declines is to set a stop order under the lowest price reached in the first 10 minutes. A stop order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the market price once the stock has traded at or through a specified price (the “stop price”). If the stock reaches the stop price, the order becomes a market order and is filled at the next available market price. Stocks that “gap up,” on the other hand, may present a great selling opportunity. Like downward trends at the open, upward trends tend to reverse themselves after the first five to 10 minutes, so you’ll want to take advantage of the upside before the stock moves lower. In these situations, using a trailing stop that rises along with the stock may help maximize your selling price. In either case, you should know by 10 a.m. ET whether the opening trend will hold or reverse itself. One clue is the strength of the trend line. If the line is steep—think 45 degrees or greater—then the trend is likely to continue. But if it’s relatively flat, there’s a greater likelihood that the trend will fizzle out. Rush hours 9:30–9:40 a.m. Stocks that open higher or lower than they closed typically continue rising or falling for the first five to 10 minutes… 9:40–10:00 a.m. …before reversing course for the next 20 minutes—unless the overnight news was especially significant. 10:00 a.m. In either case, you should know by this time whether the opening trend will hold or reverse itself. 3:00–4:00 p.m. While price trends can break either way in the opening hour, they tend to build consensus in the closing hour—barring big news during the trading day. 9:30–9:40 a.m. Stocks that open higher or lower than they closed typically continue rising or falling for the first five to 10 minutes… 9:40–10:00 a.m. …before reversing course for the next 20 minutes—unless the overnight news was especially significant. 10:00 a.m. In either case, you should know by this time whether the opening trend will hold or reverse itself. 3:00–4:00 p.m. While price trends can break either way in the opening hour, they tend to build consensus in the closing hour—barring big news during the trading day. 9:30–9:40 a.m. Stocks that open higher or lower than they closed typically continue rising or falling for the first five to 10 minutes… 9:40–10:00 a.m. …before reversing course for the next 20 minutes—unless the overnight news was especially significant. 10:00 a.m. In either case, you should know by this time whether the opening trend will hold or reverse itself. 3:00–4:00 p.m. While price trends can break either way in the opening hour, they tend to build consensus in the closing hour—barring big news during the trading day. Before the closing bell End-of-day trading tends to solidify the consensus established by action earlier in the day. Stocks that have been trending up typically keep rising, while stocks that have been tracking lower often plumb new depths. This is largely because end-of-day trading tends to be dominated by institutional investors. Index-fund managers generally trade near the close to match the returns of their benchmark. And mutual funds typically wait to execute trades so they know how much cash they need to raise to cover the day’s redemptions or, conversely, how much cash from new inflows they have to invest. Both factors tend to reinforce the direction prices have been heading over the course of the day. Indeed, if the market has been exhibiting a general uptrend, more often than not it will continue to move higher in the last hour. If you planned to sell a profitable position, this may be a good time to do it. You never know what news might hit after the close, and there’s always the potential for the stock to gap lower the next trading day. On the other hand, end of day is generally not a great time to add a position, even one with a clear positive trend. Two caveats: Big news during the day—say, a Federal Reserve interest rate announcement—can upset these market tendencies. And when reversals do occur in the final hour, they tend to be severe. For example, if the market has been moving lower and then starts to recover, nervous traders may begin snapping up shares to close out their short positions in what is called a “short squeeze,” pushing prices dramatically higher. On the flip side, those with long positions may move to sell if prices that have been trending higher face resistance in the final minutes. Either way, it’s wise to wait until the last 10 to 15 minutes to determine whether the day’s trend will hold or reverse. Reducing your exposure Generally speaking, we believe traders should never use more than 5% of their account for a single trade. During the especially fitful opening and closing hours, it may make sense to lower that exposure to no more than 1%. And while there’s no guarantee that a stop order will be executed at or near the stop price, stop orders can help protect you against significant declines—especially when you’re not available to actively monitor your positions during trading hours.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Every year thousands of people lose millions of dollars to investment fraud. One conservative estimate is that one in 10 investors will be victimized at some point in their lives, and seniors are targeted more often than younger people.1 The number and sophistication of investment scams is ever-growing—but by maintaining a healthy dose of skepticism and training yourself to spot some common red flags, you may be able to protect yourself and your loved ones from becoming victims. The come-ons Be skeptical if investment opportunities come with any of the following features: Guaranteed high returns Low or no risks Invitations to join exclusive investment organizations The ability to \"get in on the ground floor\" Claims of breakthrough technologies Penny stocks Seminars, free meals, or travel offers The tactics Be particularly alert to these types of strategies: Unsolicited approaches by phone, email, or text or in person A hard sell and lofty promises No way to call back or follow up with the seller Insistence on a quick decision Sketchy details Complicated explanations or use of highly complex terminology Emails and newsletters with unclear sources Sidestepping scams Here are some ways to avoid the potential of financial exploitation, should you or a loved one be approached with an unsolicited investment opportunity: Verify credentials. Legitimate investment professionals are registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or your state securities or insurance regulator. You can use BrokerCheck, a free online tool offered by FINRA, to review a broker\\'s qualifications, registration, and employment history. BrokerCheck also contains a disclosure section with information about customer disputes, disciplinary events, and certain criminal and financial matters on the broker\\'s record. Adopt a mindset that \"there’s no such thing as easy money.\" Guaranteed, assured profits with zero risk simply don’t exist; every investment involves some degree of risk. Don’t follow the crowd. So-called affinity frauds prey upon members of a common social circle, religious group, or ethnic background. If someone tells you that \"everyone\" is in on the deal, they may be lying—or they may have victimized a number of your peers already. Refuse to rush to decision. Legitimate investment professionals will allow you time to conduct your due diligence. If you\\'re given a limited window in which to accept, walk away. Never feel obligated. Even if you\\'re offered something for free, such as a meal or a seminar, you don\\'t owe a salesperson anything. Don\\'t let guilt guide your investing decisions. Ask for documentation. Stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs are typically required to have a prospectus, and bonds are required to have an offering circular. If there’s no documentation, the securities may not be registered with the SEC—which usually prevents them from being sold to the public. Other ways to protect yourself Never act on an unsolicited offer to buy any investment product. Keep your financial information to yourself: Never share account numbers, user names, logins, passwords, or personal identification numbers. Keep your assets at a reputable firm. Never invest in a product you don\\'t understand. Ask questions about costs and risk, and ask for responses in writing. Verify what you\\'re told with a trusted advisor or friend.

       "   'content': 'Starting to invest might feel intimidating if you feel like you have to figure everything out on your own—but, fortunately, there are plenty of good examples to follow. Successful investors tend to share similar ideas about when and how to invest. Here\\'s a look at seven ideas to get you going. Idea 1: Earlier is easier The earlier you start investing, the less you may need to save to reach your goal, thanks to the potential for long-term compound growth. Consider two investors who each wanted to save $1 million by age 65: Rosa started investing at age 25, so she needed to save just $5,720 a year to achieve her goal. Jin, on the other hand, didn’t start investing until he was 35, so he needed to save $11,125 a year to achieve the same goal. \"At age 35, Jin still has three decades to invest to meet his goal. Nevertheless, he has to save nearly 50% more than Rosa to achieve the same goal,\" says Mark Riepe, head of the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"Not everyone will be able to do that, which is why it’s so important to invest as much as you can as early as you can.\" Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Calculations assume a lump-sum investment on January 1 of each year and a 6% average annual return and do not reflect the effects of investment fees or taxes. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to represent a specific investment product. Idea 2: Diversify, diversify, diversify You can help protect your portfolio against large drops in the market and also potentially boost your portfolio\\'s value through diversification. For example, if you had an all-stock portfolio, you could own stock in large companies (large-cap), small companies (small-cap), and international companies. Then, you could diversify your large-cap stocks by investing in different sectors, such as technology and health care. Finally, within the technology sector, you could buy stock in hardware, software, semiconductors, and networking. For new investors, exchange-traded funds and mutual funds are an easy way to diversify without doing a lot of research on individual investments. Alternatively, if you\\'re interested in particular companies, purchasing fractional shares can be a sensible way to diversify your large-cap stocks in the S&P 500®. Because you\\'re not purchasing a whole share, fractional shares are more affordable. Also, they can allow you to practice your trading skills while potentially risking less money. Depending on market conditions and other economic factors, an all-stock portfolio may be more profitable than one that includes other asset classes. Just remember that stock prices can fall as quickly as they rise. Are you willing—and able—to take that risk? If not, a blended portfolio containing stocks, bonds, and other asset classes could mitigate your risk over the long haul. For instance, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds was less volatile—and had an ending value nearly 9% greater—than an all-stock portfolio. \"A diversified portfolio won\\'t always outperform an all-stock portfolio, but it will generally lose less of its value during a downturn,\" Mark says. \"And when your portfolio is less volatile, you\\'re less likely to make rash decisions that could undercut your savings.\" Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Morningstar, Inc. Data from 12/1999 through 06/2021. Portfolio performance during market crashes is based on monthly data, not peak-to-trough declines. The blended portfolio is composed of 60% stocks and 40% bonds. Stocks are represented by total annual returns of the S&P 500® Index, and bonds are represented by total annual returns of the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index. The portfolio is rebalanced annually. Returns include reinvestment of dividends, interest, and capital gains. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Idea 3: Small fees can make a big dent over time Management fees—from expense ratios charged by mutual and exchange-traded funds to the annual fees charged by an advisor—are often a necessary part of investing. That said, even seemingly small differences can erode your returns over time. \"Make sure you\\'re getting what you pay for—whether that’s strong returns, exceptional service, emotional support that keeps you on track, or practical, trustworthy advice,\" Mark says. \"In any case, it\\'s wise to scrutinize your investment expenses regularly—perhaps as part of your annual portfolio review.\" Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Ending portfolio balances assume a starting balance of $1,000 at age 25, a 6% average annual return, and no additional contributions or withdrawals and do not reflect the effects of taxes. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. Idea 4: Sometimes, the best thing to do is nothing When the market is in a free fall, you might be tempted to flee to the safety of cash. However, pulling out of the market for even a month during a downturn could seriously stunt your returns. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research and Morningstar. Market returns are represented by the S&P 500® Total Return Index, using data from January 1970 to March 2021. Cash returns are represented by the total returns of the Ibbotson U.S. 30-day Treasury Bill Index. Since 1970, there have been a total of six periods where the market dropped by 20% or more, also known as a bear market. The cumulative return for each period and scenario is calculated as the simple average of the cumulative returns from each period and scenario. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Examples assume investors who switched to cash investments did so in the month that the market reached its lowest point and remained in cash for either one, three, or six months. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. \"The problem with selling during a market drop is that by the time you act, the worst may already be behind you,\" Mark says. \"Thus, not only are you locking in your losses, but you\\'re likely to miss some of the best days of the recovery, which often happen within the first few months.\" Idea 5: You may have more control over your tax bill than you think Taxes may be a certainty, but there\\'s still plenty you can do to try to minimize them. For example, how you sell appreciated investments can have a big impact on how much of your gains you get to keep. \"You never want to think about taxes after the fact because, by then, it’s too late,\" Mark says. \"Instead, taxes should be an integral part of your investment choices—because seemingly small decisions can have big implications on your tax bill.\" Let\\'s say you\\'re looking to realize a $5,000 gain on an investment you\\'ve held for 11 months. Because you\\'ve held the investment less than a year, your gains will be taxed at your marginal federal tax rate—24% for a 25-year-old single filer making $76,000—resulting in a $1,200 tax bill ($5,000 0.24).1 To reduce your tax bill, you could take one of three common approaches: Approach 1: Hang on to the investment for at least a year and a day, at which point any gains would be taxed at your long-term capital gains rate of 15%, resulting in a $750 tax bill ($5,000 0.15).2 Approach 2: Sell another investment at a loss to offset some or all of your short-term $5,000 gain. For example, if you realize $3,500 in losses, your gains would be reduced to just $1,500, resulting in a $360 tax bill ($1,500 0.24). Approach 3: Combine approaches 1 and 2—holding on to your investment for at least another month and a day and realizing $3,500 in losses to offset your $5,000 gain, resulting in a $225 tax bill ($1,500 0.15). The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. Idea 6: Saving more doesn’t have to hurt Instead of saving a flat dollar amount each year (see \"Scenario 1\" below), consider contributing a percentage of your income so your contributions increase anytime your income does (see \"Scenario 2\"). \"Of all the ways to save more, this approach is pretty painless,\" Mark says. \"It doesn\\'t eat into your take-home pay because it\\'s being skimmed off your raise. It\\'s harder to miss what you never had to begin with.\" Better yet, increase that percentage by at least a point anytime you get a raise, which can have an even greater impact on your portfolio value (see \"Scenario 3\"). Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. In Scenario 1, the investor contributes 5% of her pretax income in the first year and then contributes that same dollar figure in subsequent years. In Scenario 2, the investor contributes 5% annually at the start of every year from age 25 through age 65. In Scenario 3, the investor contributes 5% annually at the start of every year beginning at 25 and then increases her contribution rate by 1 percentage point with each raise. Scenarios assume a starting salary of $76,000, annual cost-of-living increases of 2%, and a 5% raise every five years. Ending portfolio balances assume a 6% average annual return and do not reflect the effects of investment fees or taxes. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to represent a specific investment product. Idea 7: Putting your financial goals in writing makes them tangible Seeing your goals on paper makes it easier to envision your financial future, which can motivate and guide you along the way. Schwab\\'s 2021 Modern Wealth Survey found that individuals who have a written financial plan are more likely to exhibit healthier money habits as well. \"It\\'s not surprising that people who put in the effort to plan for the future are more likely to take the steps necessary to make that vision a reality,\" Mark says. Source: Schwab Modern Wealth Survey. The online survey was conducted from 02/01/2021 through 02/16/2021 in partnership with Logica Research among a national sample of Americans ages 21 to 75. Quotas were set so that the sample is as demographically representative as possible. Your investment strategy should begin with a well-thought-out plan—then try implementing just a couple of these ideas and see how your financial journey progresses. You can always make adjustments along the way.

       "   'abstract': 'IRAs may offer tax benefits, but breaking the rules can have severe consequences for your savings. Here’s how to avoid some common IRA tax pitfalls.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) can be a great way to save for retirement because of the tax benefits they can provide. If you’re eligible, you can choose a traditional IRA for an up-front tax deduction and defer paying taxes until you take withdrawals in the future. Or, if eligible, you might opt for a Roth IRA and contribute after-tax money in exchange for tax-free distributions down the road.1 (For more details on which account might be best for you, see Roth vs. Traditional IRAs: Which is Right for Your Retirement?) So, what’s the catch? There are a few. If you run afoul of some of the IRS rules surrounding these accounts, the penalties can be quite stiff—all the way up to a disqualification and taxation of your entire account. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, and with few exceptions, the IRS isn’t very forgiving of mistakes. Knowing the rules can help you navigate the many potential IRA tax traps you might encounter on your way to retirement. Here we’ll cover some of the more common pitfalls, divided into three major categories: Contributions and investments Withdrawals Estate planning Keep in mind that when we discuss taxes and penalties, we’re referring to those at the federal level. In most states, you will also face ordinary state taxes and may incur additional state penalties as well. 1. Contribution and investments Exceeding IRA contribution limits If you contribute more than the contribution or income limits for your filing status, the penalty is 6% of the excess contribution for each year until you take corrective action. For example, if you contributed $1,000 more than you were allowed, you would owe $60 each year until you corrected this mistake. To do that, you have two options: Withdraw the excess amount, plus any earnings specifically tied to the excess contribution, by the due date (plus extension) of your tax return for the year of contribution. Leave the excess contribution alone. You might choose to do this if the amount is so small that the 6% penalty isn’t worth the hassle of fixing it or if your contribution has increased in value so much that the tax on the earnings (plus the 10% penalty for early withdrawal) would be worse than paying the penalty. In that case, you would pay the 6% penalty for one year, and then count the excess as a deemed contribution in the next year (assuming you’re eligible to make a contribution at that point). Self-directed IRA prohibited investments If you personally manage and invest your own retirement money through a self-directed IRA, be aware that IRA rules prohibit investing in collectibles, which include artwork, rugs, antiques, metals, gems, stamps, coins, alcoholic beverages, and certain other tangible personal property. If you do so, the amount you invest will be considered a distribution to you in the year invested and subject to taxes and the 10% penalty, if the premature distribution rules apply. However, you can invest IRA contributions in coins minted by the U.S. Treasury Department that contain one ounce of silver or gold or one-half, one-quarter, or one-tenth of an ounce of gold. You can also invest in certain platinum coins and certain gold, silver, palladium, and platinum bullion. Likewise, owning real estate directly in an IRA isn’t prohibited, but you could find yourself engaged in a prohibited transaction if you are not extremely careful. If you want to invest in precious metals or real estate in your IRA, then a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) may be a better choice (although you might be subject to unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI). But if the ETF or mutual fund ever made an in-kind distribution of a prohibited investment—such as gold bullion that doesn’t meet the Treasury’s definition of allowable investments, you would still be subject to prohibited investment rules.2 Unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) Interest income, dividends, capital gains, and profits from options transactions are exempt from UBTI, but an IRA could earn UBTI if it has any of the following characteristics: Operates a trade or business Has certain types of rental income Receives certain types of passive income from a business it controls or from a pass-through entity such as a partnership that conducts a business (for example, master limited partnerships and real estate partnerships) Uses debt to finance investments If your IRA earns UBTI exceeding $1,000, you must pay taxes on that income. Your IRA might be required to file IRS Forms 990-T or 990-W and pay estimated income taxes during the year. And in the case of a traditional IRA, UBTI results in double taxation because you have to pay tax on the UBTI in the year it occurs and taxes when you take a distribution. Prohibited transactions Regardless of what you invest in, you should avoid prohibited transactions since they could cause your entire IRA to lose its tax-deferred status. Prohibited transactions include these: Borrowing money from your IRA (for example, treating it as a margin account) Selling property to it Receiving unreasonable compensation for managing it Using it as security for a loan Using IRA funds to buy property for personal use (not including the first-time home buyer exemption) If you engage in a prohibited transaction, your entire account stops being an IRA as of the first day of that year, and the account is treated as having made a taxable distribution of all its assets to you based on fair market value on the first day of the year. This is as bad as it sounds—engaging in a prohibited transaction could result in the destruction of your IRA. Rollovers You can make unlimited direct (trustee-to-trustee) transfers of your IRA funds. However, when you take receipt of the money yourself, you face a number of restrictions.3 First, you have 60 days to redeposit it into the same or another IRA or else it counts as a taxable distribution. In addition, you are only allowed one such “rollover” each year. If you deposit the funds into another IRA and then attempt another rollover within 12 months, the withdrawal will be immediately taxable. Also, be aware that any transaction resulting in a taxable IRA distribution could be subject to a 10% penalty if you’re under age 59½. One other thing to keep in mind is that when you take receipt of the money, it could be subject to withholding. You’ll get the withholding back when you file your tax return (assuming you don’t violate the rollover rules), but in the meantime, you have to come up with 100% of the distribution amount in 60 days. Bottom line: If you need to switch custodians, play it safe and stick to the direct trustee-to-trustee transfer method. Traditional to Roth IRA conversion Converting from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA might make sense if you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket when you begin taking withdrawals, you can pay the conversion tax from outside sources, and you have a reasonably long time horizon for the assets to grow. However, even if you meet these basic criteria, you should consider the following potential conversion traps: Hidden taxes: A Roth conversion analysis shouldn’t just look at your marginal ordinary income tax impact. Depending on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) before converting, the additional conversion income could trigger increased taxation because of the following factors: Taxability of Social Security benefits Triggering the alternative minimum tax (AMT) Phase-out of exemptions, deductions, or eligibility for other tax breaks Potential financial aid loss because of a higher AGI Aggregation rule for partial conversions involving after-tax money: If you have made nondeductible contributions to your traditional IRA in the past (tracked via IRS Form 8606), you can’t pick and choose which portion of the traditional IRA money you want to convert to a Roth. The IRS looks at all traditional IRAs as one when it comes to distributions. Traditional IRA balances are aggregated so that the amount converted consists of a prorated portion of taxable and nontaxable money. Failure to first take required minimum distributions (RMDs), if applicable: You can’t avoid taking RMDs by converting funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Premature withdrawal penalty: If you’re under 59½, you’ll pay a 10% penalty if you withdraw funds to pay the conversion tax. Also, even though withdrawals of regular contributions made to a Roth IRA are normally penalty free, you can’t convert from a traditional IRA to a Roth in order to avoid the premature withdrawal penalty (unless you wait at least five years or to age 59½, whichever is less). (For more, see 3 Reasons to Consider a Roth IRA Conversion.) 2. IRA withdrawals Premature withdrawals If you withdraw money from your IRA before age 59½, you will incur a 10% penalty plus ordinary income tax on the amount attributable to previously deductible contributions and earnings. There are some exceptions to this rule (see IRS Publication 590-B), including these: Disability or death of the IRA owner Withdrawals that constitute a series of “substantially equal periodic payments” made over the life expectancy of the IRA owner Withdrawals used to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of AGI Withdrawals used for a first-time home purchase (subject to a lifetime limit of $10,000) Withdrawals used to pay for the qualified higher-education expenses of the IRA owner and eligible family members Withdrawals for birth or adoption expenses of up to $5,000 Even if you can avoid the 10% penalty, you will still pay ordinary taxes. More importantly, you will have less money in your retirement account, and you’ll lose out on any potential tax-deferred growth. Remember, you can only contribute so much to these accounts annually, and you may never be able to make up for the money you withdraw. Required minimum distributions (RMDs) If you’re age 72 (or age 70½ prior to January 1, 2020) or older, you must take RMDs from your traditional IRA. The penalty for failing to take your RMD is a 50% excise tax on the amount you were required to take but didn’t (plus ordinary income tax, of course). You need to take your RMD before December 31 each year. The one exception is for the year you turn 72, in which you have the option of waiting until April 1 of the following year to take your RMDs. Waiting, however, means you will have to take two RMDs in that next year, which may not be a good idea if it bumps you into a higher tax bracket. Luckily, original owners of Roth IRAs are exempt from RMD rules, but beneficiaries who inherit a Roth IRA are generally required to take distributions and those rules depend on several factors. The IRS requires that you calculate the RMD for each IRA separately, based on the value of the account at the end of the prior year divided by your life expectancy factor (taken from the appropriate table in IRS Publication 590-B). However, once you’ve calculated your RMD for each traditional IRA account, you can aggregate the total and take it from one or multiple IRAs in any combination, as long as you withdraw the total amount required. 3. Estate planning Designating a beneficiary for your IRA Make sure you have up-to-date beneficiaries on your IRA accounts, since these assignments supersede a will. For example, if your will states that your IRA is to go to your daughter, but you have your sister listed on your IRA account as the beneficiary, your daughter may not get the funds. Beyond that, beneficiaries need to be careful about how and when they access inherited IRA funds. As a general rule, beneficiaries should defer withdrawals for as long as the law allows. For example, a spouse who inherits an IRA and has many years before hitting the RMD age may consider rolling over those assets into their own IRA. However, under the SECURE Act’s new 10-year distribution rules, some non-spousal beneficiaries of a tax-deferred IRA may be better off taking distributions each of the 10 years, in order to avoid a large tax bill on the 10th year when all inherited assets will need to be distributed. Given the right set of circumstances, a beneficiary may be able to “stretch out” the IRA distributions over his or her lifetime. For more information on inherited IRAs, see IRS Publication 590-B or talk to a tax professional. Naming a trust as your IRA beneficiary Most of the time, naming your spouse as your IRA’s primary beneficiary provides the greatest flexibility. The next best route is to name a non-spouse beneficiary, such as a child or even your favorite charity. In a few cases, it does make sense to name a trust as the beneficiary of your IRA. For example, a trust could make sense if the intended beneficiary is a young child or someone who is not savvy with money. Naming a trust as beneficiary can lead to all kinds of unintended consequences if you’re not careful. For example, naming a trust instead of a spouse as beneficiary removes the surviving spouse’s ability to roll over the IRA into his or her name to take advantage of the IRA ownership rules. Be sure you have a legitimate reason to name a trust as beneficiary, and then only do so after you consult with an independent and objective tax and estate expert working in conjunction with your financial advisors and account providers. 1 Roth IRAs require a 5-year holding period before earnings can be withdrawn tax free. In addition, earnings distributions prior to age 59½ are subject to an early withdrawal penalty. 2 Check with your fund provider for details on any past distributions. 3 A check made payable to a new financial firm for the benefit of an account holder that is sent directly to the payee and then forwarded to the new financial institution is considered a transfer and not a rollover.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My dad introduced me to the financial advisor he’s been using for years. I met with him a couple of times, but feel like we’re on different wavelengths. Do you think I’m right to look for someone else—and if so, what’s the best way to go about switching? —A Reader Dear Reader, The answer to your first question is simple: If you’re not comfortable with an advisor, it’s absolutely worth looking into changing relationships. Of course, it can feel a little awkward—especially if the advisor has a tie to your family—but it's your money and your future that’s at stake. The second part of your question is a bit more involved. Financial advisors come in lots of different shapes and sizes—from registered brokers to independent investment advisors to financial planners. Each may be credentialed but may well have different backgrounds and areas of expertise. On a personal level, and this is equally important, it is essential to find an advisor with whom you can connect—someone who listens to you, who understands your questions, and who can provide understandable answers. Your goal is to find that person who has the right combination of professional qualifications and personal qualities to support your needs. Your father’s advisor may be great for him, but you owe it to yourself to find an equally good match for yourself. Let’s take a look. Start by asking yourself some important questions Finding the best advisor starts with looking inward. You can begin this process by asking yourself some basic questions: What are my most important financial goals? For one person this might be launching a business, or graduate school, or perhaps even an early retirement. Of course, your goals are likely to change with time, but thinking in concrete terms can help ground your initial process. What type of financial advice do I need? Do I simply want one-time advice on a specific topic or ongoing help and guidance? You may have a good handle on your savings goals, for example, but need help in building and managing your portfolio. Or perhaps you also need help with estate, education or insurance planning. What level of service and advice do I want from an advisor? Some advisors meet clients in person and some virtually. Some advisors work in teams while others work solo. Some advisors just provide investment management services. Some provide more comprehensive financial planning, advice and counsel on your personal finances. Bottom line, you want to work with an advisor that works around your life—and not the other way around. Next, start your search Your next step will be to start gathering names. Ask trusted friends, colleagues, or family members for their recommendations. Or if you currently have a relationship with a particular financial services firm you could also start your search there. Before you set up any appointments, it’s time to do some detective work. You can find information on financial advisors at places like FINRA Broker Check and the SEC. Your state insurance or securities regulator may also have information on an advisor you're considering. While choosing a licensed investment professional isn’t a guarantee of skill or honesty, unlicensed, unregistered persons commit much of the investment fraud in the United States according to the SEC. Even if a close friend, colleague, or family member recommends someone to you, you should still check the person's background. That's how Bernie Madoff did so well. All his investors knew one another and assumed that if their friends used him then he must be good. Wrong! Don’t take their word for it. Do the research yourself. Set up appointments and ask questions Every advisor is different. When you first meet, your goal will be to understand the services they provide, how and how often they communicate with you, the fees they charge, and varying philosophies on how they help clients. Here are a few of my favorite questions to ask when you first meet with a potential advisor: What services do you provide? Financial planning? Investment management? Budgeting? Insurance planning? All of the above? What professional licenses do you hold? Are you registered with FINRA, the SEC or a state securities regulator? Can you tell me more about your background? Do you have particular expertise serving particular populations? Do you or your firm have a specific investment philosophy? What type of investment products and services do you offer? Are there products or services you don’t offer? How do you get paid? Do you have minimum account balances? Do you receive commissions on products I buy or sell? A percentage of the amount of my assets you manage? A flat fee? What other fees do you charge? How often will you contact me? And when are you available if I have questions? As you talk through these initial questions, you should also start to get a good feel for the advisor’s personality and communication style. Do a gut check. Are you comfortable sharing personal information with this individual? Are the candidate’s answers clear and direct? If you have any hesitation about their honesty or willingness to take time with you, those are important red flags. Understand fees and expenses Compensation matters; in fact, understanding how an advisor gets paid can help you identify and avoid potential sources of conflicts of interest. Keep in mind that regardless of how an advisor is paid, it's essential that they always put your best interests first. Fees are also important because they can take a big bite out of your investment returns. Therefore, it’s important for you to understand what and how you’re being charged, and that you feel comfortable that all fees are reasonable and justified. Switching advisors isn’t easy, so I commend you for taking the time to find someone who better fits your personality and understands your needs. I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to do your homework. As you interview candidates, be direct and listen to your gut as they respond to your questions. Remember, it’s your money and your advisor will work for you. Good luck. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

Not only do they bypass probate—the often-lengthy legal process of validating your will—but they also leave behind precise, legally binding instructions for how to distribute and potentially maintain your assets. This can be especially critical if you have a beneficiary with special needs or one who is otherwise ill-equipped to manage an inheritance, or you’re bequeathing complex assets that will require ongoing attention after you’re gone. That said, “establishing your own trust can be a minefield,” says Kimberly Frank, a Schwab senior wealth strategist. Here, Kimberly and her colleague George Pennock, director of trust services consulting for Charles Schwab Trust Company, share four common missteps people make when setting up a trust—and how to avoid them. Mistake No. 1: Failing to fund the trust According to Kimberly, the biggest and most costly mistake she has seen people make when creating a trust is failing to fund it. “You’d be surprised how many people go through the effort and cost of meeting with an attorney to formalize their wishes, only to leave the trust empty,” she says. Once you’ve done the paperwork, you must follow up by retitling the appropriate assets in the name of the trust as instructed by your attorney. In the case of insurance policies and retirement accounts, retitling may be as easy as updating your beneficiary designations online. For bank accounts and nonretirement investment accounts, you’ll need to reach out to your financial institutions. And for real estate or business interests, you may need to work with your attorney to properly transfer such assets into the trust. “Any assets that aren’t appropriately retitled may have to go through probate, which can be a very lengthy process,” Kimberly says. And don’t assume a so-called pour-over will—in which you decree that the property in your estate should be distributed to the trust upon your passing—will help your estate avoid probate. “It will simply make sure the assets eventually end up in the trust once the probate process has concluded,” she says. Mistake No. 2: Choosing the wrong trustee Whether or not you’re able to act as the trustee of your own trust during your lifetime, you’ll eventually need someone else to manage the assets and execute transactions, including distributions, after your passing. “Older adults often want to lean on their kids to fill these roles, but you have to think about whether family dynamics could get in the way,” Kimberly says. “I’ve also seen grantors name their adult children and new spouse as co-trustees, which can lead to all kinds of conflict if they have competing interests or don’t see eye to eye.” In such cases, it may make more sense to appoint a close family friend or corporate trustee instead. You might also consider combining the two approaches, naming an individual and a corporate trustee as co-trustees. Where the trustee resides may matter, as well. Some states, including California and New York, tax the income from trusts administered in their states. Certain states may also offer better protection from creditors than others based on where the trustee resides. “Depending on the size and complexity of your estate, where a trustee is located could matter significantly,” George says. An estate-planning attorney can help you think through such considerations as part of the trust-creation process. Mistake No. 3: Underestimating financial needs When designing a trust, many people concentrate more on portioning out what they have rather than assessing what their beneficiaries might actually need. “I’ve seen people put $1 million into a trust thinking that will maintain their spouse’s lifestyle,” George says. “But what if that person lives another 10, 15, or 20 years? Part of your process should be understanding the assumptions that underpin your planning—and accounting for different scenarios. You don’t want your loved ones to run out of funds.” In addition, think about the costs your beneficiaries might incur when maintaining cherished but potentially burdensome nonfinancial assets, such as property. Most houses, for example, require repairs and general upkeep, and those costs can be considerable for higher-priced or second residences. Mistake No. 4: Failing to update your trust Unless you’re working with an irrevocable trust—which, once established, generally can’t be modified or revoked—you may want to periodically make changes to your trust should circumstances, such as death or divorce, require it. Kimberly recommends meeting with an estate-planning attorney at least every three to five years to address any such changes. It also makes sense to stay on top of changes in tax laws that could affect how trust assets are treated. For example, Congress is in the process of debating legislation that could include a variety of tax increases. One proposal under consideration would be drastically lowering the estate tax exemption from its current level of $11.7 million to as little as $5.8 million. (Read more about some of the proposals under consideration here.) “The current higher level may remain in place through the end of 2021,” Kimberly says. “While it’s not certain what changes to tax law we could see, families should decide whether they’ll execute any ‘use it or lose it’ gifting decisions as soon as possible, before any new laws are enacted that could impact their planning.” It’s also possible that Congress could ban or make less effective other estate tax-planning strategies before the end of 2021, whether on the date any new laws are enacted or some proposed future date prior to the end of the year. “Wealthy clients considering implementing any estate tax planning strategies should consider scheduling a meeting with their attorney as soon as possible to discuss their options,” Kimberly adds. “Drafting and signing a trust can take time, as can transfers to trusts or individuals. Many attorney offices are also very busy given the current legislative climate, so don’t delay.” Trust in the process When designed correctly, a trust can help your heirs bypass the costs, delays, and headaches that often arise from probate proceedings. “The difference between a well- and poorly designed trust is usually the quality of the counsel you’re getting,” George says. “After all, your wishes are only as good as the trust designed to implement them.” Trust us A corporate trustee provides financial expertise, unbiased decision-making, and fiscal responsibility for the duration of a trust.

       "   'content': \"Basic estate planning usually starts with a will, which deals not only with your property but also with important decisions such as who will care for minor children if both parents are deceased. But wills aren’t necessarily the best, final option for every estate, especially given the legal proceedings that must occur before any assets are distributed. That’s where a trust can help. What is a trust? A trust is a fiduciary arrangement that specifies how your assets are to be distributed, usually without the involvement of a probate court. They can be structured to take effect before death, after death, or in case of incapacitation. In contrast, wills take effect only upon death and typically need to be authenticated by a probate court, which can take time and involve additional costs. Trusts can be arranged to accomplish a variety of different goals. For example, you can use a trust to transfer property, help minimize estate taxes, preserve assets for minors until they are adults, or benefit a charity. And while trusts have a reputation for being expensive, some attorneys offer a basic trust package for a flat fee. That said, the bill can add up quickly if you and your attorney need to spend a lot of time discussing your goals before the trust agreement is drafted. The kind of assets included in the trust and the complexity of the distribution strategy can also affect pricing. So, it makes sense to do some planning beforehand. To learn more about the benefits and drawbacks of trusts, as well as the ways in which Schwab can help clients work through their estate-planning needs, we talked with three Schwab professionals: Brad Reeves, an assistant branch manager in Austin, TX; Lauray Kennedy, a financial consultant in Houston, TX; and George Pennock, director of trust services consulting for Charles Schwab Trust Company, in Henderson, Nevada. Q: Why would someone consider a trust? Brad: In a word: specificity. A trust allows you to be very specific about how, when and to whom your assets are distributed. On top of that, there are dozens of special-use trusts that could be established to meet various estate planning goals, such as charitable giving, tax reduction, and more. Taxes may be especially top of mind these days, as Congress considers lowering the gift and estate tax exemption. (For more on that, see Will Taxes Rise for the Wealthy?) George: A trust not only identifies who may benefit from trust resources, but also defines how and when, including in cases of incapacity. Anyone concerned about facing a stroke, dementia, or Alzheimer’s may want to consider using a trust to ensure their resources are preserved, managed, and spent in line with their wishes while they are under the care of a loved one or health professional. They are also extremely flexible in terms of how you deploy them. For example, you can appoint a trustee to help assist beneficiaries who may struggle to manage their bequest. You can also structure trusts to protect the beneficiaries from creditors, manage their state income taxes and/or preserve the generation-skipping tax exemption. Q: Why not just create a will instead? George: A major limitation of wills? You have to die first. If you are incapacitated, a will has no legal effect, so any healthcare or durable powers of attorney you might have in place will guide any decisions made on your behalf. This could create problems if you need to complete financial transactions with outside parties who have trouble accepting or even refuse to accept the power of attorney. Lauray: The probate process can be lengthy and potentially costly. Keep in mind that each state where assets are held in title of the decedent will need to be probated, resulting in additional costs. Also, a will is a public document that could be scrutinized or contested, as well as give the public access to information that you might wish to keep private. Any assets held in a trust can typically be managed by the successor trustee in a more private manner than a typical probate proceeding. Brad: Many people draft wills with trust provisions, otherwise known as “testamentary trusts.” These work in much the same way as other trusts, except that by their very nature they may have to go through the probate process. This means the probate court could choose to distribute the deceased’s assets in a way that differs from her or his original intentions. A living or “inter-vivos” trust, on the other hand, allows the owner to plan during his or her lifetime, thereby bypassing the probate process and controlling decisions related to the distribution of assets. Q: Do certain types of trusts make sense for most people? George: A revocable living trust is the most common tool used by estate planners, and represents a fundamental building block for most estate plans. Lauray: A living trust is a lot like a “regular” account in that you still have control over your assets. You can buy, sell and trade assets as you normally would. You’re able to move assets into and out of the trust at your discretion. The key difference is that you can put additional controls and designees in place to help protect your assets should you pass away or become incapacitated. What is a revocable trust? A revocable trust is a trust that can be changed at any time and in any way during the owner’s lifetime, up to and including total revocation. What is an irrevocable trust? An irrevocable trust is one that cannot be changed or revoked after the agreement has been signed. A revocable trust becomes irrevocable upon the death of the original trust owner. The benefit of an irrevocable trust is that, when certain conditions are met, the assets can be removed from the trustee’s estate, thereby potentially reducing the estate’s value and its associated estate tax liability. Assets held in a revocable trust, on the other hand, are considered part of the original owner’s estate. What is a revocable trust?

Assets held in a revocable trust, on the other hand, are considered part of the original owner’s estate. Q: Are there any disadvantages to trusts? Brad: I’d call them trade-offs. For example, a trust can be more expensive and complicated to draft than a will. Sitting down with an estate-planning attorney can be very expensive, particularly if you don’t know what you want or need from the trust. You could end up paying thousands of dollars just to talk through your situation, not including the additional fees to actually draft the documents. However, incurring additional costs on the front end could save your heirs a significant amount of money on the back end by avoiding the probate process. Lauray: There are ways to bypass some of the costs associated with trusts, particularly through the planning process. Understanding these trade-offs and determining your needs and goals will serve you well once you’re ready to engage an estate-planning attorney. George: It’s not a disadvantage so much as a misconception that can keep people from setting up a trust, but people often mistakenly assume you need to have a lot of money to justify creating a trust. That’s not true. A trust is a tool in the estate planner’s toolbox—nothing more, nothing less. If a client is concerned about incapacity or wants their assets to transfer to beneficiaries in a particular manner, a trust is a useful tool to make that happen. Another thing to keep in mind is that as useful as trusts are, there are certain things the trust’s creator can do to help the process. Letting people know the trust exists, as well as the thinking behind its creation are important to cultivating stewardship around the bequest. Q: How can Schwab help clients with their estate planning and trust needs? Brad: Schwab doesn’t provide tax or legal advice. However, we can educate clients about the estate-planning process and provide insights and considerations to help them have a successful meeting with their estate-planning attorney. Working through the details ahead of time could potentially save significant time and money in the long run. Schwab can also set up trust accounts for clients and help coordinate between other accounts—depending on the client’s overall investment goals and preferences. Lauray: As a financial consultant, it’s my job to help clients think through their estate-planning needs at the highest level: What does their estate look like? Who will inherit their assets? What are they trying to accomplish? George: Our team of wealth strategists and trust services consultants can help you optimize your plans. We serve as subject matter experts that clients and their financial consultants can turn to when assessing their plans. We also work with clients and their attorneys regarding the appointment of Schwab as a current or successor trustee. Naming trustees When you set up a revocable living trust, you generally have a few choices to make about who will serve as trustee when you're gone. It’s an important role. Trustees manage the assets in the trust on behalf of the beneficiaries. They must also make sure all the outstanding bills and taxes are paid, in addition to other official matters. You can name a single person to serve as a trustee—some people name their spouse—or even a group of several people whom you can designate to serve in order of preference. You can also appoint co-trustees, though if you name an even number of co-trustees, you’ll want to consider including a tiebreaker to step in in cases where where the co-trustees disagree. Finally, you can designate a corporate trustee at a bank or trust company if you can’t find someone someone with the time, expertise and emotional intelligence needed to handle these responsibilities. Hiring a corporate trustee doesn’t have to be expensive. No matter who you name, it’s important to involve your trustee in the process early on so he or she will be prepared to step in when the time comes. Trustees need to understand how the trust is structured and what their duties will be. They should also know where all the assets are. Having this kind of clarity can make your trustee’s work easier and help head off potential disputes between beneficiaries down the line.

       "   'abstract': 'Here are the top five reasons people give for not having a financial plan—and why everyone needs one.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, A recent Schwab survey asked how confident people were about reaching their financial goals. Over half of Americans who have a written financial said they feel “very confident” about reaching their financial goals compared to only eighteen percent of those without a plan. And guess who has healthier money habits when it comes to saving and investing? Those with a written financial plan of course! Ah, yes, you may be saying, there she goes again. Because if you read my column regularly, you know that I'm a big believer in the importance of financial planning for everybody. And with October being financial planning month (as well as Fall, Oktoberfest, and Halloween), I can't help but make my yearly push for this very important tool. But this time rather than just repeat all the compelling reasons why you should have a financial plan, I want to highlight some of the main reasons people give for not having one, and offer my rebuttals. So if you've yet to be convinced—or just haven't gotten around to it—I hope you'll see something here that motivates you. Top five reasons people give for not having a financial plan—and why you should 1) I don't have enough money to need one—This is the number one reason I hear for not having a financial plan. My reply? If you don't have a lot of money, financial planning may be even more important because it can help you identify and prioritize your goals and begin to take measurable steps to achieve them. Think of a written financial plan as a roadmap that can help you spend wisely, control debt, save and invest smartly, and provide the shortest and safest route to where you want to go financially. If you're starting small, that's totally fine. You don't have to have a lot of money to get on the road. No matter how much money you have, you want to make sure you're going in the right direction. 2) It seems too complicated—It's not. A good financial plan isn't something esoteric that only a financial whiz can understand. On the contrary. Financial planning is designed to answer real life questions. For instance, are your goals realistic? How can you prioritize spending? Can you save for a down payment and the kids' education at the same time? When can you retire and how much will you need? Wherever you are on the wealth or life spectrum, these types of questions will help you build a personalized financial plan. And the answers can provide peace of mind and actually simplify your life. 3) I don't have the time to develop one—Yes, you'll have to invest some time to create a financial plan but it doesn't have to be a burden, especially if you work with a financial advisor. Ideally, financial planning is a collaborative process. An advisor can help you zero in on the questions, explore different answers, and come up with a specific plan of action. Might it take a few hours to dig into the details? Yes. The actual amount of time will depend on the complexity of your financial situation. But think about how much planning you did for your last vacation. Your financial future deserves at least the same amount of effort. Plus, today’s technology and financial planning tools make it easier than ever. But however long it takes to develop a plan, if it helps you achieve your goals and gives you a sense of financial security, it will be time well spent. And in the long run, a financial plan can actually save you time—and money! 4) Nothing's happening in my life to require one—It's true that a major life event—marriage, divorce, new baby, buying a home—can make you rethink your finances. And if you've never had a financial plan, these occasions would be a great time to create one. But why wait? Having a financial plan can make these transitions easier and help make sure your plans stay on track. To me, financial planning isn't a one-time thing. It's a dynamic process that evolves as your life and goals change. But you first need to get started—and there's no time like the present. 5) It's too expensive to get help creating one— If cost is your main concern, there are online advice services that can make it easy and inexpensive for do-it-yourselfers. However, there can be substantial benefits to working with a financial planning professional that make it worth the additional cost. Often, financial planners work in teams with different subject matter experts. These trained eyes will help you uncover obstacles to reaching your goals and help identify gaps and unseen risks. Even a one-time professional consultation can give you the benefit of second opinion to either confirm you're on the right track or offer alternate strategies. Fees for financial planning services vary and can range from hourly to a flat fee. Many financial professionals offer an initial complimentary consultation so you can discuss what you're looking for, what's offered, and the fee structure. Subscription based planning is an increasingly popular option. The cost depends on the type and level of advice you want. The best and most important reason to do it now There’s no “one-size-fits-all” when it comes to financial planning, but the process usually covers saving and investing. Comprehensive financial planning looks at all aspects of your financial life and can also include things like retirement, insurance, and tax and estate planning. Best of all, you’ll get a personalized plan of action. To me, that's a pretty compelling reason. But that's not all. Going back to the survey I mentioned, respondents with a plan are more likely to have a 3-month emergency fund, not carry credit card balances, make payments on time, and have a portfolio that reflects their goals, time frame and feelings about risk. Most importantly, having a plan can make people feel financially stable. To me, that's the best counter argument to whatever your reason for not having a financial plan. I rest my case.

       "   'content': 'The IRS allows various tax deductions for investment-related expenses if those expenses are related to producing taxable investment income. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, some of the rules related to the deductibility of investment expenses have changed. Since maximizing your tax deductions has the potential to reduce your tax burden, let\\'s look at some of the most common deductible investment expenses and how they can reduce your taxable income. No more deduction for miscellaneous investment-related expenses Prior to the TCJA, taxpayers were allowed a tax deduction for certain expenses known as \"miscellaneous itemized deductions.\" Miscellaneous itemized deductions included expenses such as fees for investment advice, IRA custodial fees, and accounting costs necessary to produce or collect taxable income. For tax years 2018 to 2025, these deductions have been eliminated. Despite concerns about the loss of these deductions, many investors may not have actually been receiving a tax benefit with the previous tax code. Prior to the TCJA, three main limitations caused people to lose a portion or all of their deductions: The 2% adjusted gross income (AGI) limitation on miscellaneous itemized deductions required your miscellaneous itemized deductions to be greater than 2% of your AGI before you could receive any benefit. The 3% Pease limitation could reduce your overall itemized deductions after you earned a certain amount of income. The alternative minimum tax (AMT) could kick in if your income and deductions were too large, resulting in a loss of all or a portion of your itemized deductions. The net effect of these limitations resulted in quite a few taxpayers thinking that they had received a deduction, but in reality, they had lost the deduction or had seen only a limited benefit. For many taxpayers the combination of all the changes within the TCJA (such as the new tax rates and brackets) may have offset the loss of miscellaneous itemized deductions. Investment interest expense If you itemize your deductions, you may be able to claim a deduction for your investment interest expenses. Investment interest expense is the interest paid on money borrowed to purchase taxable investments. This includes margin loans for buying stock in your brokerage account. In these cases, you may be able to deduct the interest on the margin loan. (This wouldn\\'t apply if you used the loan to buy tax-advantaged investments such as municipal bonds.) The amount that you can deduct is capped at your net taxable investment income for the year. Any leftover interest expense gets carried forward to the next year and potentially can be used to reduce taxes in the future. To calculate your deductible investment interest expense, you need to know the following: Your total investment income for investments taxed at your ordinary income rate Your total investment interest expenses (for loans used to purchase taxable investments) To calculate your deductible investment interest expense, you first need to determine net investment income. This normally includes ordinary dividends and interest income, but does not include investment income taxed at the lower capital gains tax rates, like qualified dividends, or municipal bond interest, which is not taxed. Now, compare your net investment income to your investment interest expenses. If your expenses are less than your net investment income, the entire investment interest expense is deductible. If the interest expenses are more than the net investment income, you can deduct the expenses up to the net investment income amount. The rest of the expenses are carried forward to next year. For example, let\\'s say Mary has $150,000 of total income, $8,000 of investment income (from ordinary dividends and interest income), $10,500 of investment interest expenses from a margin loan, and $13,000 of other itemized deductions (such as mortgage interest and state taxes). *Example assumes that Mary itemizes deductions. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. Because of the investment interest expense deduction and other itemized deductions, Mary\\'s taxable income has been reduced from $150,000 to $129,000. Qualified dividends Qualified dividends that receive preferential tax treatment aren\\'t considered investment income for purposes of the investment interest expense deduction. However, you can opt to have your qualified dividends treated as ordinary income. In the right circumstances, electing to treat qualified dividends as ordinary dividends can increase your investment interest expense deduction, which could allow you to pay 0% tax on the dividends instead of the 15% or 20% tax that qualified dividends normally receive. Here\\'s an example of how it might work. In addition to the information in the first example, let\\'s say Mary has $2,000 of qualified dividends, on which she would normally pay $300 in tax ($2,000 x 15% tax rate). If Mary elected to treat the qualified dividends as ordinary income, she could boost her net investment income from $8,000 to $10,000. As a result, she would be able to deduct more of her investment interest expense in the current year—and pay no tax on the qualified dividends. *Example assumes that Mary itemizes deductions. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. Because Mary is a tax-savvy investor, she was able to reduce her taxable income from the original $150,000 to $127,000. That $10,000 investment interest expenses deduction resulted in $2,220 of tax savings (assuming an ordinary tax rate of 24% and a long-term capital gains tax rate of 15%). Note: The election to treat qualified dividends as ordinary dividends should not be taken lightly. Once made, the election can only be revoked with IRS consent. Consult with your tax professional before implementing this tax strategy. Capital losses Losing money is never fun, but there is a silver lining. Capital losses can be used to offset your capital gains. If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, up to $3,000 of those losses (or $1,500 each for married filing separately) can be used to offset ordinary income and lower your tax bill. Net losses of more than $3,000 can be carried forward to offset gains in future tax years. Don\\'t forget about the cost basis of your investment To make the most effective use of capital losses, keep track of your investment cost basis. The cost basis is generally equal to an investment\\'s purchase price plus any expenses necessary to acquire that asset, such as commissions and transaction fees.

       "   'content': 'As an investor, you’re likely aware that there are costs to managing your own money. But there might also be implicit or “hidden” cost that you should consider–like missing opportunities or holding on to losing stocks. If your investment portfolio isn’t delivering as expected, ask yourself whether you have these four traits in abundance: time, interest, discipline, and expertise–or TIDE. Let’s talk more about why the TIDE traits are important. High TIDE vs. low TIDE Time is one of the most vital traits. As traders and investors, you must consistently dedicate enough time to execute your plans. Interest is equally important. You need to want to spend the time you have available on managing your money. Should your interest in investing fade over time, it’s likely your results will fade as well. Discipline helps you stick to your plan in the face of market volatility or other hiccups. To be disciplined, consider: Screening: As you look to add new positions, what are the criteria you’ll use to come up with a list of candidates? Researching: As you look to narrow down your list, consider using both: Fundamental analysis: How is the company doing as a business? (What to buy) Technical analysis: What is the trend in price of the stock? (When to buy or sell) Establishing buy and sell rules: As you look to place a trade, determine how much you’ll buy and how you’ll buy it. Identify how you will cut losses and capture profits. Monitoring: Determine how often and in what manner you’ll review your portfolio. Expertise is as important to managing your long-term investments as it is to managing your trades. There’s no shortage of resources available to help you get better at investing, whether you’re looking to beef up your understanding of a new asset class, sector, retirement strategy or other subject. But you have to want to put in the time. Now ask yourself: Are you making goal-based decisions? Establishing clear financial goals and creating a plan to achieve them is our first Investing Principle at Schwab. When you don’t take the time to write down your financial goals and how much savings it will take to achieve them, you’re less likely to stay on track. Have you determined your exit points? Another of Schwab’s Investing Principles is to build in protections against significant losses. With trading, we often preach the importance of having a sell discipline—or setting specific exit points for selling a stock, which can help guard against losses. Emotions such as fear and greed can rule our longer-term investing decisions, if we let them. Fear can force us to make ill-timed decisions that derail our financial plans. Greed often pushes us in the opposite direction, causing us to take too much risk or load up on concentrated stock positions hoping for a home run. For example, without a sell discipline, you may be holding on to losing stocks–which may not only may cost you in the short term, but you may not reach your financial goals over the long term. Do you have a diversified portfolio? Building a diversified portfolio and rebalancing your portfolio on a regular basis–two other Schwab Investing Principles–are proven methods that can help investors reduce volatility and stem portfolio declines. Meanwhile, regular rebalancing helps keep single investments or asset allocations from having too much influence in your portfolio. Each of these tasks takes time, interest and discipline, along with a commitment to getting better at it by developing a routine (i.e., expertise). Find your path If you have the TIDE qualities that enable you to help reduce those indirect costs of investing, then you’re at a good starting point to realizing your financial goals. But if you find yourself struggling to find the time, stay interested, remain disciplined or lack expertise, you may want to update your goals with the guidance of a financial professional, and schedule an annual portfolio check-in to determine whether you’re on track to meet those goals.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Learn how stock traders who prefer to follow the trend can use trailing stops as an exit strategy.',\n",
       "   'content': 'A trailing stop order is a variation on a standard stop order that can help stock traders who want to potentially follow the trend while managing their exit strategy. Here we explain trailing stop orders, consider why, when, and how they might be used, and discuss their potential risks. What is a trailing stop order? A trailing stop order is a conditional order that uses a trailing amount, rather than a specifically stated stop price, to determine when to submit a market order. The trailing amount, designated in either points or percentages, then follows (or “trails”) a stock’s price as it moves up (for sell orders) or down (for buy orders). Upon submission, the trailing stop order remains in force until it’s triggered by a specific change in the inside bid price (for sell orders) or the inside ask price (for buy orders). Once triggered, it becomes a market order and is submitted for immediate execution. After the market order is submitted, it generally will result in an execution, but there’s no guarantee that you’ll get any specific execution price or price range. The resulting execution price may be above, at, or below the trailing stop’s trigger price itself. Using a percentage as a trailing amount When using a percentage for the trailing amount, remember that the actual point spread between the current price and trigger price will vary as the trigger price is recalculated. For sell orders that use a percentage as the trailing amount, the point distance between the security’s price and the trigger price will widen as prices move higher. For buy orders that use a percentage as the trailing amount, the point distance between the security’s price and trigger price will narrow as prices move lower, since the percentage will be based upon a new, lower price. Why should I use trailing stop orders? Trailing stops can provide efficient ways to manage risk. Traders most often use them as part of an exit strategy. Trailing stop sell orders For trailing stop sell orders, as the inside bid increases to new highs, the trigger price is recalculated based on the new high bid. The initial “high” is the inside bid when the trailing stop is first activated, so a “new” high would be the highest price the stock achieves above that initial value. As the price moves above the initial bid, the trigger price is reset to the new high minus the trailing amount. If the price stays the same or falls from the initial bid or highest subsequent high, the trailing stop maintains its current trigger price. If the declining bid price reaches, or crosses down through, the trigger price, the trailing stop triggers a market order to sell. When should I use trailing stop orders? Trailing stop orders will only trigger during the standard market session, 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET. They won’t trigger or be routed for execution during the extended-hours sessions, such as the pre-market or after-hours sessions, or when the stock is not trading (e.g., during stock halts or on weekends or market holidays). You can decide how long your trailing stop will be effective—for the current market session only or for future market sessions as well. Trailing stop orders that have been designated as day orders will expire at the end of the current market session if they haven’t been triggered. But good-’til-canceled (GTC) trailing stop orders will carry over to future standard sessions if they haven’t been triggered. At Schwab, GTC orders remain in force for up to 60 calendar days or until cancelled, whichever comes first. What are the risks of trailing stop orders? Trailing stop orders submit a market order when triggered, generally offering execution. Managing a position is essential in trading and it’s important to understand the risks you face when using trailing stops. Stock splits. The triggering of a trailing stop order relies on market data from third parties. Your order may be set off prematurely as a result of a stock split, symbol change, price adjustment, and/or incorrect value or an away-from-the-market value sent from one of the third parties. Gaps. Trailing stops are vulnerable to pricing gaps, which can sometimes occur between trading sessions or during pauses in trading, such as trading halts. The execution price can be higher or lower than the trailing stop’s trailing amount or trigger price; the trailing amount or trigger price only indicate at what price you want the market order to be submitted. Market closure. Trailing stops can only trigger during the regular market session. If the market is closed for any reason, trailing stops won’t execute until the market reopens. Fast markets. How fast prices move can also affect the execution price. When the market fluctuates, particularly during periods of high trading volume, the price at which your order executes may not be the same as the price you saw at the time the order was routed for execution. Liquidity. You could receive different prices for parts of your order, especially for orders that involve large numbers of shares. No market for the security. If there’s no market for the stock (meaning there’s no bid or no ask available) or if the stock itself is not open for trading, the market order triggered by your trailing stop can’t execute. What’s next? While standard stop orders can help investors attempt either to limit losses or preserve profits, trailing stop orders offer the opportunity to do both with a single setup. Familiarize yourself with the risks and explore how trailing stop orders can help support your exit strategy.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Designed to generate short-term income or purchase desired stocks at a favorable price, writing cash-secured equity puts, or CSEPs, is a bullish strategy that many traders find appealing. However, it\\'s important to have the proper expectations before you establish the position(s). While the ideal candidate is a stock with which you\\'d be comfortable with either outcome, you might not continue to feel that way if the stock drops sharply. Therefore, it is important to know what to do if the CSEP doesn\\'t work out as planned. How do you create a CSEP? A CSEP is generally written out-of-the-money (OOTM), meaning at a strike price that is below the underlying stock\\'s current price. A CSEP is essentially the same strategy as an uncovered (naked) put, except that with a CSEP, you need cash in your account equal to the total amount of the potential assignment, in the event the stock shares are assigned (put) to you. CSEPs can be a good strategy if you\\'re willing to buy a stock that you\\'re bullish about in the long term, but you think it might drop a little in the short term. Keep in mind that a big drop in the stock price might force you to buy the stock above the market price at the time of assignment. And while you might be unhappy with that outcome, you\\'d be no worse off than if you had already owned the stock. Before selling a CSEP, always ask yourself, \"Would I be okay with buying the underlying stock at the strike price on this option?\" If you can answer yes, then writing a CSEP is a strategy you may want to consider. Profit and Loss Profile for a CSEP Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. If you sell OOTM CSEPs and the underlying stock remains relatively stable or increases in value, the options will eventually expire worthless. Sometimes, however, the stock may end up very close to the strike price or go down enough to end up in-the-money (ITM). What you choose to do next depends on whether or not your opinion about the stock has changed. Are you more or less bullish, or perhaps you\\'ve turned bearish? Let\\'s explore six possible alternatives. 1. Expiration: Do nothing and let your options expire worthless. If the underlying stock has remained relatively flat or increased slightly, your CSEPs may be OOTM as the expiration date approaches. In this situation, the best course of action may be to let your OOTM CSEPs expire worthless. When this occurs: The options will be automatically removed from your account. The net credit from the original sale of the options will be retained in the account with no further obligation. Note that this is the maximum profit that can be earned on CSEPs. At this point, if you are still at least moderately bullish on the underlying stock, you can sell new CSEPs for a later month; if not, you\\'re done. Sometimes as the expiration date approaches, the underlying stock may be very close to the strike price and you can\\'t determine whether you will be assigned or not. If you\\'re willing to take the risk, you can simply do nothing and if the options are exactly ATM (at-the-money) or OOTM, they will most likely expire worthless. When this occurs: The CSEPs will be automatically removed from your account. The net credit from the original sale of the options will be retained in the account and you have no further obligation. At this point, if you\\'re still at least moderately bullish, you can sell new CSEPs for a later month; if not, you\\'re done. If the options expire ITM and you\\'re assigned, keep reading. 2. Assignment: Do nothing and let the stock be put to you at or before expiration. If your CSEPs expire ITM and you do nothing, you will most likely be assigned and required to purchase the underlying stock at a price equal to the strike price of the CSEPs. This could occur prior to expiration or at expiration; unless you have become bearish on the stock, this may be an acceptable outcome. If your CSEPs are only slightly ITM, this is usually a good thing. You just purchased a stock on which you were bullish, at a price you originally deemed favorable, and your overall net cost basis will actually be lower than the strike price. If your CSEPs expire deep ITM, your net cost basis could exceed the current market price of the stock. While you could have an unrealized loss at this point, your overall basis will still be lower than if you had purchased the stock on the day you originally sold the CSEPs. When you are assigned, the CSEP will be automatically removed from your account and the underlying stock position will be placed in your account. You also will be charged for the purchase of the stock at the strike price of the option. Sometimes options assignments occur prior to expiration. While this is somewhat rare for CSEPs, it may occur when a long put holder chooses to exercise in order to establish a short stock position, or because the underlying stock pays a dividend. Options prices are not adjusted for normal quarterly dividends. As a result, an owner of protective long puts that has become bearish on the stock may decide to exercise the puts on the ex-dividend date in order to sell the stock but receive the very last dividend payment. This generally happens when the put options are ITM and the amount of the dividend exceeds the remaining time value in the options, or if the bid price of the options has dropped below the intrinsic value. This incentive exists because the strike price the owner of the puts will receive for the stock is the same before or after the ex-dividend date. However, if the owner waits at least until the ex-dividend date, then they will be the owner of record when the next dividend is paid. While this risk is relatively small, if you intend to sell CSEPs on dividend paying stocks, take note of the ex-dividend dates. If you are willing to take this risk, keep reading. 3. Close-out: Buy back the CSEPs at a gain or loss. Let\\'s say that you\\'ve sold CSEPs on a stock and the stock price rises faster than you expected. However, you\\'re concerned that the price may come back down before expiration. One course of action may be to close out your CSEPs by buying them back in the market, which under these circumstances can usually be done at a gain. If you have chosen to sell CSEPs on a dividend-paying stock and the options are ITM as the ex-dividend date approaches, you can sometimes avoid early assignment by buying back the CSEPs before the ex-dividend date (at either a gain or a loss). Keep in mind that as a CSEP seller (writer), you have assumed an obligation to buy the underlying stock any time the put owner (buyer) chooses. While early assignments generally occur on the ex-dividend date, they can happen any time your CSEPs go ITM. If your CSEPs go ITM any time prior to expiration and you simply want to avoid further losses, you can usually close out your CSEPs by buying them back in the market, usually at a loss. 4. Rollout: Buy back your CSEPs and sell same strike CSEPs for a later month. Sometimes as the expiration date approaches, the underlying stock may be very close to the CSEP strike price and you can\\'t determine whether you will be assigned or not. If you are indifferent about getting assigned, then simply do nothing. If you\\'re still bullish on the underlying stock in the long term, but believe that further downside risk is possible in the short term, consider a rollout. A rollout closes out the existing CSEPs of the current month and simultaneously sells CSEPs with the same strike price for a later month. Schwab\\'s trading platforms have a rollout screen that is specifically designed for this purpose. When your near-month CSEPs are close at the money (ATM), a rollout to a later month can usually be entered at a net credit. This is because the time value on an option with a later expiration will usually exceed the time value on a nearer option. This is especially true for options that are ATM, because they generally carry the greatest amount of time value. However, if the options are deep ITM or way OOTM, the difference in time values may be so small that the spread between the bid and ask will cancel the time value out and the rollout can\\'t be done at a net credit. In this situation, a same strike rollout may not be the best course of action. Let\\'s look at a couple of examples. Example: Even strike rollout Assume stock BAAA is currently trading at $74.13 and your July 85 puts are $10.87 ITM. In the below screenshot, notice that the bid at the quoted market price of $10.35 is currently $0.52 below the intrinsic value. The August 85 puts are priced slightly above the July contracts and they have $0.33 in time value. However, this difference is not enough to offset the wide spread between the bid and ask prices. Source: StreetSmart Edge®. In this example, an even strike rollout, if entered at the market price, would require a $0.05 debit and may not be a prudent trade because it simply postpones the (most likely) inevitable assignment for another month, and it costs money to do so. Alternatively, you could buy back the CSEPs to close, but you might have to pay $0.38 in time value, since they are $10.87 ITM but have an ask price of $11.25. In this situation, it might be wise to enter a limit order for at least a small credit, but if the order fails to execute, consider just accepting the assignment and purchase of BAAA at $85.00. While this is well above the current market price and would likely result in a loss, depending upon the price at which you originally sold your CSEPs, your overall cost basis could still be below $85.00. For comparison, in the screenshot below, stock BAAA is currently trading at $74.13 and your July 75 puts are ITM by only $0.87. You could enter this rollout for a net credit of $1.21, which represents one month\\'s worth of time value and lowers your overall cost basis by $1.21 if you eventually get assigned. This even strike rollout would postpone a likely assignment (for now) and generate an additional $121 cash per hundred shares (not including commissions). If your outlook on BAAA is still short-term bearish but long-term bullish, this might be a prudent trade. Source: StreetSmart Edge®. Example: Turn your CSEPs into a spread It is early July, and you are bullish on PPGG, which is currently priced at $83.65. However, you think PPGG could have a small price dip in the near term, so rather than buying 1,000 shares now, you decide to make the following CSEP trade: Sell 10 PPGG Aug 80 Puts @ 1.00 (to open) Net credit = $1,000 (1.00 x 10 x 100) Days until expiration = 40 Breakeven = $79.00 (strike price – option premium) Max loss = $79,000 ([0 – breakeven price] x 1000) Max loss occurs at 0, at expiration Max gain = $1,000 (net credit) Original CSEP Position Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Two weeks later, PPGG has dropped to $81.00 and your puts have increased to $1.50. As a result, you have an unrealized loss of -$500. What should you do? If you do not anticipate further downside in PPGG, you might consider just taking the assignment (see “Assignment: Do nothing and let the stock be put to you at or before expiration,” above. On the other hand, if you\\'re uncertain about the future direction of the stock given its recent decline, keep reading. 5. Create a bullish put spread by buying some lower strike puts for the same month. If you have at least level 2 (spread trading) option approval, and you are still bullish but have become more concerned about protecting your downside, consider converting the original CSEP into a bullish put spread by buying some puts with a lower strike price. Sell 10 PPGG Aug 80 Puts @ 1.00 ◄original position Buy 10 PPGG Aug 75 Puts @ .25 ◄new position Net debit = $250 (.25 x 10 x 100) Days until expiration = 26 Breakeven = $79.25 (short strike – total net credit) or $80.00 – (1.00 – 0.25) Max loss = $4,250 (difference in strikes – net credit) Max loss occurs at $75.00 or below at expiration Max gain = $750 (net credit from all trades) Max gain occurs at $80.00 or above at expiration Net New Bullish Put Spread Position Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. The effect of the new bull put spread is that while your breakeven price only went up a little (from $79.00 to $79.25), you have sharply reduced your downside risk (from $79,000 to $4,250). Your immediate unrealized loss has increased slightly (from –$500 to –$750) if the stock stays about where it currently is and you will earn your maximum gain at expiration. The stock can continue to move lower (by up to 1.75 more points) before you will sustain losses. 6. Create a bearish put spread by buying some higher strike puts for the same month. Let\\'s say that you have decided that you\\'d rather not own PPGG after all, because you are now bearish. You can convert the original CSEP into a bearish put spread by buying some higher strike puts. Sell 10 PPGG Aug 80 Puts @ 1.00 (to open) ◄original position Buy 10 PPGG Aug 85 Puts @ 4.50 (to open) ◄new position Net debit = $4,500 (4.50 x 10 x 100) Days until expiration = 26 Breakeven = $81.50 (long strike – total net debit) or $85.00 + (1.00 – 4.50) Max loss = $3,500 (net cost of both trades) Max loss occurs at $85.00 or above at expiration Max gain = $1,500 (difference in strikes – net cost of both trades) Max gain occurs at $80.00 or below at expiration Net New Bearish Put Spread Position Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. By buying the higher strike puts and converting your CSEPs into a bearish put spread: A substantial additional capital investment of $4,500 would be required. The spread is already ITM by 0.50 and the maximum gain can be obtained with an additional $0.50 drop in price. The maximum gain is now $1,500 instead of $1,000 as it was originally. It is very important to be sure that you are bearish on PPGG before you create this spread, because if PPGG increases above $81.50, losses will begin to mount very quickly. In conclusion The matrix below summarizes the various alternatives I have described above: Managing CSEPs Decision Matrix Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Key points to remember: While a CSEP is used primarily as an income-generating strategy, you should only consider a CSEP on a stock you would be comfortable owning. If the price of the underlying stock drops substantially prior to the expiration date of the CSEP, your losses could be significant. Losses would be limited to the strike price down to zero minus the premium you received on the sale of the puts. A significant increase in the price of the underlying stock will generally result in a profitable trade, but your profit will be limited to the premium you receive on the sale of the CSEPs. You wouldn\\'t lose money, but you would lose an opportunity to profit on a long position in the stock. Keep in mind that if your put options go ITM, you could be assigned at any time.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Some economists and market analysts believe that interest rate increases have an adverse impact on equity markets. Their reasoning is that money becoming more expensive to borrow creates a disincentive for margin traders to borrow and trade equities. Yet there has often been very little correlation between interest rates and margin debt. Conventional wisdom tells us that equity and bond markets tend to move in opposite directions most of the time, which leads to rising equity markets as interest rates increase. But finding periods when this isn’t the case is not all that difficult. Like many historical relationships, the opposite may be true at different times and under different circumstances. More often than not, it seems that equity and bond markets operate completely independent of each other and that many of the old relationships between the markets and interest rates no longer apply. When the global financial crisis forced the Federal Reserve to cut the Fed funds rate to essentially zero back in late 2008, option strategies intended to take advantage of rising interest rates became mostly irrelevant, and they remained so for the next seven years. The Fed began to gradually hike rates again from late 2015 through 2017, but those hikes were quickly unwound when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, and they have been essentially at zero ever since. While the Fed has significant control over the short end of the yield curve, a sharp uptick in inflation expectations could cause longer-term rates to rise—which is what happened in early 2021. Despite a commitment by Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell to maintain a low interest rate environment for an “indefinite” period of time, by March 2021 interest rates on the 10-Year Treasury Note began to rise, hitting a 14-month high of 1.75%. Since no one knows whether that trend will continue, it might be useful to know what your options are. Option pricing First, let’s review how the price of an option is affected by interest rates. To understand this concept, you need to have a basic understanding of option Greeks. Greeks, including Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho, measure the different factors that affect the price of an option contract. They are calculated using a theoretical options pricing model. The Greek that relates to interest rates is Rho. Essentially, Rho estimates how much the price of an option contract should rise or fall if the assumed “risk-free” interest rate increases or decreases by 1% (of course, a 1% change in interest rates is quite substantial). The most recently auctioned 90-day Treasury bill is often used as a proxy for the risk-free interest rate. You can obtain a quote on this rate at Schwab using the symbol $IRX, then moving the decimal point one digit to the left. For example, if the current quote on the $IRX is 0.15, it means the 90-day T-bill interest rate is 0.015%, or 0.02% when rounded to two decimal places. As shown below, $IRX is the rate used by many option pricing models, and the Trade & Probability Calculator tool available in the StreetSmart Edge® trading platform. Interest rate index: $IRX Source: StreetSmart Edge® How Rho affects options Rho affects options in the following ways: Call options have positive Rho, so as interest rates increase, call options tend to increase slightly in price, all else being equal. Put options have negative Rho, so as interest rates increase, put options tend to decrease slightly in price, all else being equal. Of all the variables that affect the price of an option, Rho is one of the least important. However, it should not be completely ignored in a rising or falling interest rate environment. Long-Term Equity AnticiPation Securities® (LEAPS®) options, which might expire up to three years in the future, are far more sensitive to changes in interest rates than are shorter-term options, primarily because rates can change a lot during a three-year time period. The simplest way to explain why interest rates affect the value of options is to think of at-the-money call options as a substitute for a long stock position and at-the-money put options as a substitute for a short stock position. While the profit and loss characteristics are not identical, they are similar enough to help illustrate how the opportunity cost impacts the value of the options in different interest rate environments. Keep in mind that it is not always appropriate for investors to use option strategies as substitutes for stock trading strategies, as stocks do not expire and may pay dividends. Option strategies always have a limited life span and do not pay dividends or have voting rights. Call option example If you buy 100 shares of XYZ at $100 per share, the cost will be $10,000. While the $10,000 is invested in XYZ, it cannot be used for any other purpose. Instead of buying 100 shares of XYZ, you could have decided to purchase two at-the-money call options expiring in six months at a price of $5 per contract. Since at-the-money call options typically have a Delta of somewhere close to 0.50 (which means they should move about $0.50 for the next $1.00 move in the stock), initially the profit and loss characteristics of these two call options are expected to be very similar to 100 shares of XYZ stock. (Note that commission charges for most stock trades at Schwab is $0.00 but the commission charge for option contracts is $0.65 per option contract, so commission costs are slightly higher for option trades.) Since the total cost of the stock trade is $10,000 but the cost of the options trade is only $1,001.30 ([$5 x 2 contracts x 100] + $1.30 online commission), the $8,998.70 that you did not spend on XYZ stock could be invested in a US Treasury bill or remain in a money market account and earn six months of dividends or interest. Using a simple interest calculation, if the Treasury interest rate is 0.15%, this $8,998.70 will earn about $6.73 (.0015 x 8,998.70 x [182/365]). In a very low interest rate environment, this might be considered negligible. However, if the Treasury rate was even 1.00%, it would earn about $44.87 (.01 x 8,998.70 x [182/365]), more than six times as much. In this example, you can see how in a higher interest rate environment, the opportunity cost of buying the stock (versus buying call options) is quite a bit higher than in a low interest rate environment. It is primarily for this reason that the option pricing model includes an interest rate component. As interest rates rise, buying calls (as opposed to buying stock) becomes a little more attractive, and that drives the price of call options a little higher. Put option example If you sell short 200 shares of XYZ at $100 per share, the proceeds of $20,000 will remain in your account and you will likely have an additional margin deposit requirement of $10,000. The $10,000 used to secure the required margin deposit will typically earn money market interest at or near the rate of a Treasury bill. Using a simple interest calculation, if the Treasury interest rate is 0.15%, it will earn about $7.48 (.0015 x 10,000 x [182/365]). However, at a Treasury interest rate of 1.00%, it would earn about $49.86 (.01 x 10,000 x [182/365])—again, more than six times as much. Instead of short-selling 200 shares of XYZ, you could purchase four at-the-money put options expiring in six months at a price of $4.50 per contract plus commissions. Since at-the-money put options typically have a Delta close to -0.50, initially the profit and loss characteristics of these four put options will be very similar to 200 short shares of XYZ stock. Since the cost of the options trade is $1,802.60 ([$4.50 x 4 contracts x 100] + $2.60 online commissions), it leaves only $8,197.40 on which you can earn interest. If the US Treasury bill interest rate is 0.15%, this will earn about $6.13 (.0015 x 8,197.40 x [182/365]); and if the Treasury rate were 1.00%, it would earn about $40.87 (.01 x 8,197.40 x [182/365]). In this scenario, you can see how the opportunity cost of buying long put options (versus selling stock short) is greater in a high interest rate environment than in a low interest rate environment. And even though interest rates have less of an impact on puts than on calls, it’s important for the option pricing model to take interest rates into account. As interest rates rise, buying puts (as opposed to selling stock short) becomes a little less attractive, which drives the price of put options lower. As shown below, you can visualize the effects of Rho by using Theoretical view on the options chain in StreetSmart Edge and setting the underlying stock price equal to a strike price that is at-the-money. Then compare the price of the at-the-money call and the at-the-money put of the same expiration. In the snapshot below, notice that when the underlying price of the example stock, DIS,1 is set to 185, the theoretical value of the 06/18/2021 185 calls is 9.50, while the theoretical value of the 06/18/2021 185 puts is only 9.46. The difference is relatively insignificant in a very low interest rate environment, but it will increase as interest rates rise. The effects of Rho Source: StreetSmart Edge® Using this tool, you could estimate that increasing the interest rate (in the green box) by 1.00% (to 1.15%) would increase the value of the calls by about $0.17 and reduce the value of the puts by about $0.19. While you may not consider this a significant change in price, consider that the Fed funds rate in mid-2007 averaged about 5.25%, which would change the prices of the above call and put options to about $10.42 and $8.49, respectively. Of course, an increase of this amount is unlikely during the course of a year, but it could happen (and has before) over a period of three years, which is more than enough time to dramatically affect the price of LEAPs options. Options strategies Now that you understand how interest rates affect the price of options, how can you use this information to create a trading strategy that might benefit from rising interest rates? In recent years, many ETFs and ETNs (collectively known as exchange-traded products, or ETPs) have been introduced that are tied to various segments of the bond market. You can find these products using the ETF screener available at Schwab.com > Research > ETF Screener. Using the ETF screener, you can search specifically for ETPs that are tied to various bonds or interest rates. Since a wide variety of choices are available (long-term bonds, intermediate-term bonds, short-term bonds, high-yield bonds, emerging markets, etc.), don’t forget the basic rule that the price of a given bond and the interest rate on that bond are inversely correlated. Even though some ETPs are difficult to sell short, with such a wide variety of products, you can take a long or short position on bonds or interest rates. With this in mind, here are some things to consider: If you are long a bond ETP, you are short the interest rate on the underlying bond(s). Some examples include TLT, JNK, and HYG. If you are short a bond ETP, you are long the interest rate on the underlying bond(s). Now that you know how interest rates can affect options and you know which products are tied to bonds and interest rates, you can combine the two items to formulate a strategy that might perform well if you think interest rates will increase. While there are many strategies available, some are likely to be more effective than others. If you expect rising interest rates, below are some guidelines regarding more versus less effective choices. More effective choices Short sale on a bond ETP If interest rates rise, bonds should drop in price, causing the bond ETP to drop in price. Covered puts (sell/write) on a bond ETP If interest rates rise, bonds should drop in price, causing the bond ETP to drop in price. The short (covered) puts should rise in value as the ETP loses value, but they should rise in value more slowly due to rising interest rates, increasing the overall profit potential. While this strategy will cap the profits if the short ETP moves sharply lower, it will generally result in a larger profit if there is only a modest move lower in the price of the ETP. Bearish (debit) put spread on a bond ETP If interest rates rise, bonds should drop in price, causing the bond ETP to drop in price. If the bond ETP drops in price, the put spread will rise in value. While the puts will rise more slowly due to rising interest rates, both the long and short puts will be affected, eliminating most of the negative impact of rising rates. Less effective choices Long puts on a bond ETP If interest rates rise, bonds should drop in price, causing the bond ETP to drop in price. If the bond ETP drops in price, the long puts will rise in value, but they should rise in value more slowly due to rising interest rates, reducing the overall profit potential. Bearish (credit) call spread on a bond ETP If interest rates rise, bonds should drop in price, causing the bond ETP to drop in price. If the bond ETP drops in price, the call spread will fall in value, but the calls will fall more slowly due to rising interest rates, reducing the overall profit potential. As you can see in these examples, when you combine bond ETPs and options, you have the opportunity to magnify (for better or for worse) your results, if you take into account not just the direction in which you expect interest rates to move, but also how that movement might affect the value of options. The bottom line Not all ETPs trade options, and some have very low liquidity. Use extra caution when trading low-volume ETPs or those with illiquid options. To profit on most option trades, you will usually need to be right about the direction of the underlying ETP, the magnitude it moves in that direction, and how long it takes to make the move. 1All securities and market data shown above are used for illustrative purposes only and are not a recommendation, offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, Several of my friends keep talking about investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. I’m thinking about jumping in too, but am concerned about the risks. What do you think? —A Reader Dear Reader, When I first wrote about cryptocurrency in 2018, the concept of a digital asset was still foreign to most Americans. Some of my children’s friends were getting excited about trading Bitcoin, but I didn’t consider cryptocurrency as a serious investment, something that I would trust or recommend to others. Today, cryptocurrency has become much more mainstream, but remains controversial, with both ardent supporters and critics. On one side of the debate, investors like Elon Musk are open about owning Bitcoin and view it as the way of the future. Squarely on the other side is Warren Buffett, who has famously described cryptocurrency as “rat poison squared.” Personally, for the time being I remain extremely wary of the multitude of risks involved with trading cryptocurrency, and think of it as speculating, not investing. That said, as digital currency matures, if increasing numbers of companies accept it as a form of payment, and especially if it becomes regulated, it\\'s very possible my opinion will evolve as well. In the meantime, the best advice I can give you is to arm yourself with the facts. Let’s take a look at what cryptocurrency is and some of the issues involved with owning and trading it. What cryptocurrency is, and how it works Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that lets you make online payments directly to other people or businesses without having to go through a third-party like a bank. Records of these transactions are logged onto a public ledger called a blockchain, which is stored and duplicated on thousands of computers around the world. Essentially, this means that when you buy Bitcoin, it creates an entry in the blockchain ledger, which is on the internet for everyone to see, but isn’t editable. This is how the system aims to remain relatively accountable and transparent. There are currently thousands of types of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Tether. You can buy units of cryptocurrency or “coins” in a variety of ways, including paying cash for them on an exchange like Coinbase; providing goods or services in exchange for the currency; or purchasing them from a Bitcoin ATM that you might find in a gas station or convenience store (similar to a bank ATM). After you buy cryptocurrency, you store the coins in an \"online wallet.\" You may have also heard of Initial Coin Offerings (or ICOs), which involve an investor purchasing cryptocurrency coins (sometimes called tokens) that can later be exchanged for the new cryptocurrency once the startups create their own “coins” to sell to investors. It is important to recognize that such offerings are not registered with the SEC. Any startup can launch a new cryptocurrency, and no one has the authority to approve or deny it. I know cryptocurrency sounds like it\\'s super modern, but digital currency has actually been around in one form or another for years. Loyalty programs like airline frequent flier miles, hotel points, and credit card points are all forms of digital currency. The benefits you receive from these programs aren\\'t in dollars, but in the company’s self-created currency. So digital cash is something a lot of us are familiar with already. Cryptocurrency is simply a newer—and more complex—form. Beware of extreme price volatility We’ve all heard of people making staggering sums off of cryptocurrency, but that only tells part of the story. Let’s take Bitcoin as an example. When Bitcoin launched in 2010, the price of one coin was $0.01. It then rose more than 1,900 percent from $975 in March 2017 to $20,000 in December. Fast forward to 2021, and Bitcoin rallied over 100 percent between January and April, reaching a high of $60,000. But it then proceeded to fall 50 percent over the next two months, wiping out all of the gains for anyone who didn’t own it before 2021. Part of the reason for this dramatic volatility is that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value. Plus, unlike other traditional currencies, they aren’t backed by a government or central bank. As a result, their price is driven purely by supply and demand. As their value increases, this success (often hyped by social media) attracts new investors—and prices can soar. But on the flip side, a single negative event or even a tweet can drive prices down just as quickly. Understand the risk for fraud and cybercrime Even though cryptocurrencies have been designed to be theft-proof, there’s also a very real chance of fraud and cybercrime. In June of 2011, for example, the Japan-based Mt. Gox (which was then the largest Bitcoin exchange) experienced a security breach in which $450 million worth of Bitcoin was stolen. And in January of 2018, hackers stole almost $500 million from the cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc. In addition, because of its intrinsic anonymity, cryptocurrency has been associated with the more unsavory side of finances, like money laundering, the black market and ransomware attacks. A recent example was the Russian ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in which the FBI was thankfully able to recover most of the stolen assets. On a more personal level, if you forget your login ID or password to a cryptocurrency exchange—or they’re stolen in a hacker or phishing scam—you can lose your access to your virtual wallet, and your currency. Unfortunately, with no issuing or regulating country or authority for cryptocurrencies, there’s very little recourse in cases of fraud or theft. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund typically protects your funds if a bank or credit union fails. But there\\'s no comparable protection for virtual currency accounts. Proceed with caution As my longtime readers surely know, I’m a big believer that everyone needs to build their investment portfolio to suit their individual needs, taking into consideration their goals, time frame, and personal feelings about risk. Therefore, I’m not going to tell anyone to completely avoid cryptocurrency. However, I want to be clear that for the reasons I’ve cited above, I consider cryptocurrency to be a speculative asset, placing it at the far, far end of the risk spectrum. If you\\'re an experienced investor with a diversified portfolio, the ability to take on the risk and a long-term investing plan, you might consider allocating a small percentage (not more than 1 percent) of your holdings to cryptocurrency. On the other hand, if you\\'re a newer investor and are tempted by cryptocurrency simply because of its buzz or because you want to make a quick profit, I’m waving the red flag. Instead of jumping on the bandwagon, I advise you to take a step back and educate yourself not only about cryptocurrency, but also about more traditional assets like stocks, bonds and cash, as well as timeless investing principles. Then, and only then, should you consider trading cryptocurrency—and hopefully only with money you can afford to lose. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Even in the best of times, not every investment will be a winner. Fortunately, a losing investment does have a silver lining: You may be able to use your loss to lower your tax liability and better position your portfolio going forward. This strategy is called tax-loss harvesting, and it\\'s one of the many tax-smart strategies that investors should consider. Tax-loss harvesting generally works like this: You sell an investment that\\'s underperforming and losing money. Then, you use that loss to reduce your taxable capital gains and potentially offset up to $3,000 of your ordinary income. Finally, you reinvest the money from the sale into a different security that meets your investment needs and asset-allocation strategy. The general principle behind tax-loss harvesting is fairly straightforward, but it\\'s best to plan your strategy to avoid some common pitfalls. The basics of tax-loss harvesting Imagine you\\'re reviewing your portfolio, and you see that your tech holdings have risen sharply while some of your industrial stocks have dropped in value. As a result, you now have too much of your portfolio\\'s value exposed to the tech sector. To realign your investments with your preferred allocation, you sell some tech stocks and use those funds to rebalance. In the process, you end up recognizing a significant taxable gain. This is where tax-loss harvesting comes in. If you also sell the industrial stocks that have declined in value, you could use those losses to offset the capital gains from selling the tech stocks, thereby reducing your tax liability. In addition, if your losses are larger than the gains, you can use the remaining losses to offset up to $3,000 of your ordinary taxable income (for married couples filing separately, the limit is $1,500). Any amount over $3,000 can be carried forward to future tax years to offset income down the road. For example, let\\'s say you recognize a gain of $20,000 on a stock you bought less than a year ago (Investment A). Because you held the stock for less than a year, the gain is treated as a short-term capital gain and will be taxed at the higher ordinary-income rates rather than the lower long-term capital-gain rates, which apply to investments held for more than a year. At the same time, you also sell shares of another stock for a short-term capital loss of $25,000 (Investment B). Your $25,000 loss would offset the full $20,000 gain from Investment A, meaning you\\'d owe no taxes on the gain, and you could use the remaining $5,000 loss to offset $3,000 of your ordinary income. The leftover $2,000 loss could then be carried forward to offset income in future tax years. Assuming you\\'re subject to a 35% marginal tax rate, the overall tax benefit of harvesting those losses could be as much as $8,050. Let\\'s take a look at how this works. Using an investment loss to lower your capital-gains tax Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. By offsetting the capital gains of Investment A with your capital loss of Investment B, you could potentially save $7,000 on taxes ($20,000 × 35%). Because you lost $5,000 more than you gained ($25,000 – $20,000), you can reduce your ordinary income by $3,000, potentially lowering your tax liability an additional $1,050 ($3,000 × 35%) for a total savings of $8,050 ($7,000 + $1,050). You could then apply the remaining $2,000 of your capital loss from Investment B ($5,000 – $3,000) to gains or income the following tax year. Issues to consider before utilizing tax-loss harvesting As with any tax-related topic, there are rules and limitations: Tax-loss harvesting isn\\'t useful in retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) or an IRA, because you can\\'t deduct the losses generated in a tax-deferred account. There are restrictions on using specific types of losses to offset certain gains. A long-term loss would first be applied to a long-term gain, and a short-term loss would be applied to a short-term gain. If there are excess losses in one category, these can then be applied to gains of either type. When conducting these types of transactions, you should also be aware of the wash-sale rule, which states that if you sell a security at a loss and buy the same or a \"substantially identical\" security within 30 days before or after the sale, the loss is typically disallowed for current income tax purposes. A tax break for ordinary income Even if you don\\'t have capital gains to offset, tax-loss harvesting could still help you reduce your income tax liability. Let\\'s say Sofia, a single income-tax filer, holds XYZ stock. She originally purchased it for $10,000, but it\\'s now worth only $7,000. She could sell those holdings and take a $3,000 loss. Then, she could use the proceeds to buy shares of ZYY stock (a similar but not substantially identical stock) after determining that it\\'s as good as or better than XYZ, given her overall investment goals and objectives. Sofia could use the $3,000 capital loss from XYZ to reduce her taxable income for the current year. If her combined marginal tax rate is 30%, she could receive a current income tax benefit of up to $900 ($3,000 × 30%). She could then turn around and invest her tax savings back in the market. If she assumes an average annual return of 6%, reinvesting $900 each year could potentially amount to approximately $35,000 after 20 years. Harvesting losses regularly and proactively—when you rebalance your portfolio, for instance— can save you money over the long run, effectively boosting your after-tax return.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"When it comes to sharing your wealth, there may be no better time than the present. “Many times, it’s better to give money or assets to your loved ones while you’re still around, rather than wait until after you pass,” advises Hayden Adams, CPA and director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. In addition to the emotional lift giving brings to those you care about, giving now can also be a savvy tax move for families with substantial wealth. That’s because both the present value and any potential future growth of the gifted assets are removed from your taxable estate. It’s important to remember that, although the IRS generally doesn’t care when you make a major gift, the timing can make a life-changing difference to your heirs. Giving a smaller amount when your heirs need it, and you're still alive, can be more meaningful for everyone than waiting to pass on a larger amount after you're gone. What matters is what works best for your family. Just make sure you understand all the rules. What is the current estate and gift tax exemption? The IRS allows a lifetime tax exemption on gifts and estates, up to a certain limit, which is adjusted yearly to keep pace with inflation. For 2021, an individual’s combined lifetime exemption from federal gift or estate taxes is $11.7 million. If married, the joint exemption is $23.4 million. (U.S. citizens also have an unlimited exemption from property they inherit from a spouse.) You can use all, or part, of your gift and estate tax exemption during your lifetime. Any portion left over then can be used by your heirs to reduce or eliminate estate taxes that might otherwise be owed. That can be a big deal for your heirs, as the current top federal estate tax rate is 40%. “If the inheritance your heirs receive is subject to the estate tax, your loved ones may not receive all that you had hoped they would,” explains Hayden. Even if your gifts deplete your entire lifetime exemption, your loved ones could still come out ahead—they would receive your gifts tax-free today and could take advantage of their potential for growth. However, there are specific giving strategies you can use today that can reduce the size of your taxable estate and leave your gift and estate tax exemption untouched. Here’s how to enjoy giving today and potentially save your family money down the line. What are some gift tax strategies to reduce the size of your taxable estate? There is an annual $15,000 gift tax exclusion, also indexed for inflation, for assets you give to individuals. It’s separate from the lifetime gift and estate tax exemption. Using the annual gift tax exclusion ensures that every penny of your $15,000 annual gift is excluded from your $11.7 million lifetime gift and estate tax exemption. And because annual gifts reduce the size of your estate, they also reduce the potential tax liability for your heirs. Individually, you’re allowed to give that $15,000 annual amount to as many people as you like. If married, you and your spouse may each give $15,000 to an individual, for a total annual gift of $30,000. For example, a married couple could give $30,000 to an adult child, and $30,000 to each of their three grandchildren, for a total of $120,000 each year. When you and your spouse combine both $15,000 annual exclusions, the strategy is called “gift splitting.” Although you won’t owe any additional taxes to the IRS, splitting gifts may still require you to file a gift tax return—Form 709—for the purpose of documentation. Making a $15,000 annual gift can be incredibly easy. If you and your spouse aren’t gift splitting, you don’t need to file a gift tax return. Recipients typically owe no tax and aren’t required to file any special tax forms. What are the rules about giving more than the annual gift tax exclusion? Suppose you give two grandchildren $20,000 each this year, and you give a family friend $10,000. The gift to the friend doesn’t trigger any gift tax issues, as it’s within the $15,000 annual exclusion. But the gifts to the grandchildren exceed the $15,000 exclusion amount by $5,000 apiece and would require some special care. The amount that exceeded the $15,000 annual limit could be deducted from your $11.7 million lifetime gift and estate tax exemption. In this example, your lifetime gift exemption could be reduced by a total of $10,000 ($5,000 for each grandchild). Assuming you haven’t already used up all your lifetime exemption, you won’t owe any tax on the gifts to the grandchildren. However, you will need to let the IRS know that those gifts exceeded the annual limit by filing a gift tax return. Which gifts are exempt from federal gift and estate taxes? In addition to the $15,000 gift-giving strategy, there are other ways you can make gifts that reduce the size of your estate, without eating into your lifetime gift and estate tax exclusion. The IRS also gives you a tax-free pass when: You pay the medical bills for another individual.1 You pay the tuition bills of a student.2 You make a charitable contribution to an exempt organization. There is no annual limit on the size of these gifts. As far as taxes are concerned, it’s as if those weren’t gifts at all. One important note regarding medical and tuition bill gifts: The money must go directly to the institutions, rather than to the patient or student you’re helping. How does giving to a 529 plan affect the gift tax? If you wish to help fund a 529 college savings plan, the $15,000 annual gift limit comes back into play. In this scenario, you’re allowed to combine five years’ worth of $15,000 gift tax exemptions into an initial $75,000 contribution to one student’s 529 account. Keep in mind that any additional gifts to that individual during the next five years will put you over the annual giving limit, so your lifetime exclusion will be reduced by those additional gift amounts. Also, if you die in the five years after you make the gift, a prorated amount of your gift is returned to your estate, but only for tax purposes. The entire amount of money you gave stays in the student’s 529 account. Your giving plan, going forward The bottom line is that giving sooner might make more sense, rather than waiting to bequeath your assets after you die. Hayden advises sitting down with a tax and estate professional to consider how a giving strategy fits in with your overall investment plan, and to determine whether it makes sense for you to give now or later. “For many people, gifting over their lifetime can be a great strategy, so long as they leave themselves enough to live on. With so much at stake, be sure to plan carefully with the help of a professional,” says Hayden. 1Medical care includes expenses incurred for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body, or for transportation primarily for and essential to medical care. Medical care also includes amounts paid for medical insurance on behalf of any individual. 2Does not include books, supplies, room and board, or other similar expenses that are not direct tuition costs.\"}],\n",

And yet, busy as all that is, patterns exist. Conventional wisdom—even when expressed in a homely proverb—can occasionally serve you as well as the super computers brought to bear on the market. Of course, that doesn’t mean you should outsource all of your trading decisions to slogans—but even the pithiest of sayings can contain enough wisdom to help guide your research. We’ve gathered five of the more reliable ones here. The trend is your friend Some traders believe that smart investing comes down to behaving differently than everyone else in the market, and bucking trends where they can. The problem is that price trends are reality, representing the collective actions of all market participants, and rebels can risk getting run over. When the broad market is trending higher or lower, so are most of the stocks in it. Rather than fighting the trend, acknowledge the direction of the overall market and plan your trades accordingly. There are limits, of course... Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful Uptrends and downtrends can be long and sturdy, but at a certain point the market will change direction. Timing these reversals is difficult—but when the sentiment toward a particular stock gets to be too strong either in favor or against, then skepticism may be in order. During these times, think like a contrarian and don’t become complacent. Don’t try to catch a falling knife This refers to the urge to buy a stock that is falling sharply. Just as it is dangerous to try and catch a knife as it falls to the floor, it can be just as risky to buy a stock during an aggressive sell-off. If your analysis of a company’s fundamentals indicates that regardless of the fall, now is a good time to buy its stock, you should do so. But don’t buy just because it appears to be “on sale.” We’ve all seen that item in the store that is marked down 10% and three weeks later is marked down 25% or more. Purchasing these “sale” items too soon can be bad for your trading account. Buy the rumor and sell the news The idea behind this saying is that traders can position themselves to profit by buying a stock when an anticipated bit of news is still just a rumor. The potential impact of rumored announcements tends to get baked into a stock’s price before any announcements are made. If the rumor turns out to be true, then it will already be reflected in the price. If the rumor isn’t true, then the trader can try to lock in a profit by selling. In short, stocks often move on speculation and then adjust when the news is official. Bull markets climb a wall of worry This is another news-related saying, this time regarding periods when the market continues rising even as some negative financial or economic news causes disquiet among the broader public. How can the market continue moving higher in defiance of prevailing sentiment? In short, buyers continue entering the market, pushing it over what otherwise might be a hurdle to further growth. If you’re waiting for everyone to agree on the market, you could be waiting for a long time. Markets can go up when people are still queasy, and fall apart during seemingly good times. Proverbs to remember The bottom line is that traders keep these sayings alive because they capture something about how people relate to markets, and how markets affect people. If they didn’t, nobody would use them. The stock market isn’t nature, with immutable physical laws governing how things work. But it does have conventions, and sometimes those conventions end up working just as well as laws.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The stock market normally leads the economy, but what happens when the economy’s path isn’t clear?',\n",
       "   'content': 'Watching the economy and stock market do their respective dances, an investor may be tempted to wonder: Are they even listening to the same music? This is especially true when the economy is moping through an extended dirge while the market does the jitterbug. Or the reverse: The economy is settling into a comfortable groove as the market collapses in exhaustion. What explains these differences, and who hired this DJ anyway? Here, we’ll look at how the economy and stock market relate, using the past 18 months to show how investors attempted to divine the economy’s stumbling path through the pandemic. Timing is everything—most of the time In general, the stock market moves before the economy does. Why? “Stock prices are based largely on investors’ expectations for the future,” says Liz Ann Sonders, Schwab’s chief investment strategist. “This generally means the probability of future profits, which are directly linked to economic activity, but also the future direction of monetary policy and interest rates.” In fact, trends in economic data tend to matter more to stock investors than their absolute level. As Liz Ann often says, “better or worse” generally matters more than “good or bad,” when it comes to how the stock market looks at economic data. This is why the stock market is considered a “leading” indicator. In fact, it is one of the 10 components of The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI), a bundle of economic indicators aimed at predicting the future course of the economy. It also explains why stocks might surge while the economy is in freefall—as they did in the spring of 2020, the early days of the COVID outbreak. The stock market wasn’t delighting in misery; it understood the power of the monetary and fiscal stimulus response, and was looking ahead to the recovery before it actually began. This doesn’t mean investors are always coldly rational. Their emotions also come into play, especially when the market is touching new highs or lows, or the economy is climbing a peak or wallowing in a valley. As a result, the stock market isn’t always “right,” and unrealistic investor sentiment can sometimes have an outsized influence on prices. When that’s happening, the market can seem like it’s no longer running ahead of the economy—or other fundamentals of value—but completely disconnected from it. We’ve seen examples of that in recent months with the crazed swings in “meme” stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other speculative areas of the market. And then there are those “black swan” events—surprises so sudden that they catch both the economy and the market unprepared. The start of the COVID pandemic serves as an example here. The COVID cycle The rapid collapse of both the stock market and economy early last year showed how forecasts and pricing mechanisms can fail in the face of the unexpected—and then rebound as the uncertainty clears. Stocks have had an extraordinary run since the COVID bear market ended in March 2020. We looked at every S&P 500® decline of at least 25% from an all-time high since the mid-1950s, and then tracked the subsequent rebounds. As you can see in the chart below, the COVID cycle outdid them all. The S&P 500 index has rebounded strongly Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 8/31/2021. Data indexed to 100. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Sector performance reflects COVID winners and losers Companies in sectors that stood to benefit from pandemic-era lockdowns and restrictions performed well, at least as long as those restrictions were in place. “As vaccinations and falling caseloads led to signs of reopening, momentum shifted toward those sectors poised to benefit most from an eventual return to normal,” Liz Ann says. “And now the spread of the Delta variant of COVID looks as if momentum could shift again.” We compared the performance of both groups relative to where they started in March of 2020 in the chart below. The COVID winners have generally been in the Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology sectors; while the COVID losers have generally been in in the Energy, Financials and Industrials sectors. Note how they swapped positions in early March this year when the economic outlook was extremely bright—as well as how they’ve recently swapped places again. A reopening economy shuffles the deck Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 08/31/2021. Data indexed to 100 (base value=3/23/2020). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Of course, COVID isn’t the only concern driving the markets or expectations for the economy. Over the past year and a half, investors have also had to digest a spike in unemployment, government stimulus efforts, massive speculation in segments of the market, and inflation concerns. They are also trying to prepare for the Federal Reserve’s plans to withdraw support from the economy, slowing earnings growth rates, and possible tax policy changes out of Washington. Where the COVID winners and losers framework can help us identify broad trends in the recovery, looking at the more granular level of sector performance reveals the still-unsettled state of the economy. The chart below ranks the 11 industrial sectors by performance each month this year (along with the monthly performance of the S&P 500). Notice the way the various sectors of the stock market have rotated in and out of the top-performer’s spot this year, providing a running commentary on how investors have attempted to make sense of these chaotic times. Rapid turnover in sector leadership Source: Charles Schwab, Bloomberg, as of 8/31/2021. Sector performance is represented by price returns of the following 11 GICS sector indices: Consumer Discretionary Sector, Consumer Staples Sector, Energy Sector, Financials Sector, Health Care Sector, Industrials Sector, Information Technology Sector, Materials Sector, Real Estate Sector, Communication Services Sector, and Utilities Sector. Returns of the broad market are represented by the S&P 500. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Where that leaves us So, what’s an investor to do when the outlook is so unclear? A key takeaway here is that sectors rotate as economic conditions shift—and if you want to be positioned to benefit no matter who’s in the lead spot, diversification is a pretty reliable way to do it. “These shifts among sectors are happening quickly, so there’s no excuse for not being properly diversified,” says Liz Ann. “And that doesn’t just mean across sectors. It also means across and within broader asset classes.” Beyond that, we always recommend investors practice good portfolio hygiene by sticking with a disciplined rebalancing scheme. Trimming investments that have grown in value, while adding to those that have fallen, forces us to do what we know we’re supposed to do—buy low and sell high. The point here isn’t to periodically grab all your gains and pile into “cheap” assets. “Investors should never think of investing as either ‘get in’ or ‘get out,’” Liz Ann says. “That’s gambling on moments in time, while investing should always be a disciplined process over time.” As the preceding charts show, trying to seize a moment can mean missing out on bigger shifts happening around you. Rebalancing helps investors to be judicious and disciplined in order to build on successes over time, while avoiding the risks that could come with big all or nothing moves.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'One of the most important parts of estate planning is determining how to divide your assets. But what if you don’t have a spouse, children, or other obvious heirs? “Those in this situation might genuinely wonder, What’s the point?” says Bob Barth, a Schwab wealth strategist based in Orlando, Florida. “But passing without a will or immediate heirs increases the odds your money will go to someone you’d rather it not.” Inheritance hierarchy While the process differs by state, the inheritance hierarchy usually goes like this: surviving spouse, followed by children, and then grandchildren. If none of those relatives can be identified, your assets could go to parents, grandparents, siblings, nephews, nieces—or even the state. “With no will or next of kin, your assets become escheated—which is just a fancy way of saying the state lays claim to them,” Bob says. “In pretty much every case, it’s better to pick someone yourself.” Alternative heirs Rather than let the state decide, people without heirs may designate a beneficiary to inherit their assets. It can be a relative, friend, or charitable organization—anyone except the attorney who drafted your will.1 If philanthropy appeals to you, you have several options, including: Charitable remainder trusts: The donor receives an immediate charitable deduction based on the present value of the cash or other property that is transferred to this irrevocable trust. The donor also receives an income stream from the trust for years or for life, and a designated charity receives the remaining assets upon the donor’s death. Donor-advised funds: The donor makes an irrevocable, tax-deductible contribution of cash, securities, or appreciated noncash assets; the donor can invest those funds for future potential growth and recommend grants to qualified 501(c)(3) charities at any time. Private foundations: This type of charitable organization is typically founded by a family or an individual with an initial tax-deductible gift and is managed by a board of directors or trustees, who may be paid for their efforts and who control the disposition of all assets; grants are not limited to qualified 501(c)(3) charities.2 The choice between them comes down to personal factors, including how much oversight you want to have and whether other family members will be involved. Be sure to talk to your financial advisor and a tax professional with experience in charitable giving prior to implementing one of these giving strategies. Beyond money In addition to stipulating what to do with your financial assets, those without obvious heirs should designate a person who can make critical decisions in case of incapacitation: A durable power of attorney for finances, for example, authorizes someone to handle your financial and legal affairs. A durable power of attorney for health care authorizes someone to make medical decisions on your behalf. A living will details the medical interventions you would and would not like to receive to keep you alive. Without such legal documents and ironclad instructions, your next of kin (as determined by the state), even if a distant relation, may decide for you. “Many people have very strong preferences when it comes to these kinds of decisions,” Bob says. “Without these documents in place, it’s out of your hands.” You’ll also want to name an estate administrator (a.k.a. executor or personal representative) to take over upon your death. An administrator will handle probate court proceedings, distribute your assets, manage the sale of your property, and notify your banks and credit card companies of your passing (which can help protect the deceased—and hence the estate—from identity theft). You could choose an accountant, an attorney, a financial planner, or even a professional executor, if available in your state. “Not all aspects of estate planning have to do with money,” Bob says. “A few hours spent today can take a lot of uncertainty out of the future.” 1In most states. 2Limitations on the tax deduction may apply based on the donor’s adjusted gross income and whether the donor itemizes her or his deductions.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, We’re in our mid-30s and have been content so far to be renters. With housing prices going crazy—and several friends jumping into the market—we’re feeling the pressure to buy now even though it would be a real stretch. Does it ever make sense to keep renting? —A Reader Dear Reader, It’s no surprise you’re feeling pressured. There’s a lot in the news about rising home prices outpacing wage growth and plenty of personal stories of homes selling for over asking price in a matter of days. Plus, the National Association of Realtors reported last March that house prices rose a record-breaking 17% year-over-year, putting that first home even farther out of reach for many would-be buyers. But a hot real estate market doesn’t mean you should get in no matter what. To me, fear of missing out is never a good reason to make a big financial decision. Even if you have the money, there are a lot of personal and emotional things to consider when buying a home. In fact, depending on your individual circumstances and preferences, there may very well be a good case for renting. Here are some situations where continuing to rent could be the best choice. You’re just not that into ownership There’s often a lot of emotion around owning a home. To some people, it’s a sign of security and stability. It can also represent a lifestyle choice—urban or suburban, long or short commute, space for kids, the ability to paint your own walls and create your own environment. Similarly, renters can have non-financial reasons for avoiding home ownership, like freedom of movement, aversion to debt, and lifestyle flexibility. You value flexibility and freedom of movement While owning and caring for a home can be highly satisfying, it can also be a burden—and not only financially. Consider your job stability, your desire to remain in a particular location, and your willingness to spend the time, money, and energy it takes to maintain a home. Maybe you can’t see yourself staying in one place long-term (five years is generally considered the minimum for buying to make financial sense). Or you’re contemplating a career change. Or you really don’t want to be responsible for that leaking roof. In any of these cases, renting might very well be the better choice. You don’t want the ongoing financial obligations Being emotionally ready to buy is one thing; being financially ready is another. There are the initial costs—down payment, closing costs, fees, and assessments—but it doesn’t stop there. Next comes your mortgage. Will the monthly payments stretch you to the limit? Then there are property taxes, insurance, maintenance, landscaping, and possible renovations. Factoring all this in from the start could give you a greater appreciation for your landlord—or at least a greater willingness to keep making those rent payments. Your other goals are more important to you Owning your own home can be a worthy goal, but it shouldn’t be your only one. You should also have an emergency fund to cover at least three to six months’ essential expenses (including a mortgage and ongoing home maintenance and unexpected repairs). Then there’s retirement. Are you currently on track with retirement saving? Would you be able to continue to save enough once you’re a homeowner? Look at all your goals, both short and long term. If a down payment will blow a huge hole in your emergency fund, or a mortgage plus the ongoing costs means you’ll have to put saving for all your other goals on hold (and you’re uncomfortable doing that), renting may be even more appealing. You’re debt averse Buying a home is the biggest investment most people ever make. It can also be the biggest debt you’ll ever take on. If you have other debts like credit cards, car payments, or student loans, would a mortgage push you beyond your comfort zone? For reference, an industry standard that still holds is that total housing costs shouldn’t exceed 28% of your gross monthly income. All your debt payments combined shouldn’t exceed 36% of gross monthly income. You live in an area where it’s cheaper to rent than buy The old real estate adage about location may be more relevant than ever. While housing prices have risen nationwide, the actual costs vary widely coast-to-coast. One measure of whether it makes more sense to rent or buy is the price-to-rent ratio in your area. You calculate this by dividing the median home price by the median annual rent. A ratio of 15 or under favors buying; 16 and over favors renting. Here’s a comparison: in New York, the ratio is 38.6; in Milwaukee it’s 12.8. Big difference. Plus, costs can vary significantly not only from city to city but in different parts of the same city. Make sure to look at specific neighborhoods and figure out the overall cost of buying a particular property in a specific location vs. renting. If you’re in a high-cost metropolitan area, renting may actually be cheaper than buying on a monthly basis. The upside—and the downside There are a lot of pluses to renting—more flexibility, less responsibility, and the freedom to save and use your money for other things. And with current limits on the deductibility of state and local taxes as well as mortgage interest, the tax benefits of homeownership aren’t as strong an argument as in the past. On the downside, rents have been rising along with home prices. June 2021 data from realtor.com show the median rent in the 50 largest metro areas rose 8.1% year over year. So unless you’re protected by a rent-control ordinance, there’s no guarantee your rent won’t go up beyond what you can handle. Another often-mentioned downside is that by not building equity, you’re missing out on an opportunity to create long-term wealth. There’s some truth to that. But to me, a house should never be considered just as an investment. While its value may increase over time, you can’t count on it. If you’re looking at buying a home just as a moneymaker, there are other investment opportunities available in real estate you may wish to consider. Which brings me to one last important point. If continuing to rent now rather than taking on the financial obligations of owning means you have more money in your pocket, use it wisely. Pay down your debts, shore up your savings, and put those savings to work by investing. Then, if in the future you decide to buy, you’ll be ready.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Dividends and interest aren’t likely to be enough to cover most investors’ income needs. Planning for some asset sales may be more realistic.',\n",
       "   'content': 'What’s the most effective way to draw an income from your savings, even as you keep those savings invested for future growth? A common assumption is that you just need to make sure your portfolio generates enough interest and dividend income for you to live on, and you’ll never have to sell anything. However, as both an investing strategy and an income plan, this may not be realistic for most investors. On one hand, chasing returns from interest and dividends can be risky. On the other, focusing just on yield may cut you off from other sources of cashflow in your portfolio. We suggest retirees think more broadly, and build a portfolio that can provide income, growth potential, and liquidity. While interest and dividends may be an important source of return, we encourage investors to think of their whole portfolios—including cash balances and asset sales to capture capital gains—as a source of funds. We call it the total return approach to investing and generating cash flow in retirement, and recommend it to most investors. Here’s how it works. The building blocks The basic retirement portfolio consists of three main asset classes: Stocks, bonds, and cash investments. (Of course, there are many other kinds of assets and sub-categories within each asset class, but we’ll focus on these three for now.) Each asset class has a unique role. Stocks can deliver price growth over the longer term and pay dividends. Bonds can generate income through fixed coupon payments and help stabilize a portfolio during a stock market downturn. Cash and other short-term investments such as bank deposits and short-term bonds or CDs offer a high level of stability, as well as liquidity and flexibility when needed. How you allocate across these classes will depend on your plans and should be structured to provide income when you need it, as well as growth for the long term. We recommend keeping a year’s worth of your expenses in cash, two-to-four years’ worth of expenses in a short-term reserve comprised of cash and short-term bonds or bond funds, and the remainder invested for the long term. The overarching goal is to have a portfolio that delivers income, even as it grows at a higher average rate each year than the portion you plan to withdraw. (So, if you’re using the 4% rule for your withdrawals, you’d aim for a growth rate above that.) Now for an example. Total return strategy in action The short version is: Interest and dividend payments pour into your cash pot throughout the year. Take your targeted annual withdrawal from there. (If you have enough, great! You’ve met your income needs for the year through dividends and interest alone.) Then rebalance your portfolio to your target allocation. This should be part of your regular portfolio maintenance, but if you still need cash, you can collect it after rebalancing. So, let’s say you’re retiring with a $1 million portfolio, in a moderate asset allocation that includes $50,000 in cash, and you hope to spend $100,000 each year of your retirement. We’ll also assume your Social Security payments and an annuity will generate $50,000 every year. That means you’ll need your investment portfolio to generate the other $50,000. The table below shows how this hypothetical portfolio would evolve over the course of a year. The Income Return column records how much investment income, or yield, each part of the portfolio would generate. That sum is collected as cash, which you can see would have boosted your cash balance from $50,000 at the start of the year to $69,250 at the end. A sample total-return based spending plan A sample total-return based spending plan Investment: Purpose Start of the year End of the year Beginning amount (portfolio weight) Income return (%) Total return (%) Ending amount (portfolio weight) Cash: Current spending $50,000 (5%) 1.5% 1.5% $69,250 (6.3%) Fixed income: Capital preservation and income $350,000 (35%) 2.0% 8.8% $373,800 (33.9%) Large-cap equities: Growth and income $350,000 (35%) 2.0% 15.1% $395,850 (35.9%) Small-cap equities: Growth and income $100,000 (10%) 1.5% 9.3% $107,798 (9.8%) International equities: Growth and income $150,000 (15%) 2.0% 6.9% $157,323 (14.3%) Total $1,000,000 (100%) 1.9% 10.4% $1,104,021 (100%) Source Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Morningstar Inc.

Please see the disclosures section at the end of the article for more information on the indexes used. That means you already have enough to plug the $50,000 gap in your spending plan for the coming year and are almost halfway to refilling your 5% cash allocation. Now it’s time to rebalance. As you can see in the End of Year Amount column, investment income and capital gains have boosted your $1 million portfolio to $1,104,021—and pushed your allocations away from their target weights. So, the next step is to buy investments that are below target—for example, in addition to replenishing your 5% cash allocation, you would also buy bonds to bring your fixed income allocation back up to 35%—and sell investments that are above target—for example, you would sell large-cap equities to bring that allocation back down to 35%. The table below shows the results. With this approach, you not only keep your target allocation on course, but you also go into the next year with a bigger portfolio than you had the year before. Notice, for example, that your 5% cash allocation is now $52,701, reflecting the fact that your overall portfolio is worth more. Of course, your portfolio won’t always be bigger. When the market is up, you may have more. When it’s down, you may have less.

Yield first It’s worthwhile to contrast this approach with one where you rely entirely on dividend and interest income in the hope that you’ll never have to sell assets for cash. Believe it or not, that kind of rigidity can be risky. Why? You may stretch for yield. An inflexible focus on generating as much yield income as possible could tempt you to focus too much on historically higher-yielding—but riskier—investments, such as high-yield bonds, master limited partnerships (MLPs), and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Though these can be appropriate in the right circumstances, our research shows that certain higher-yielding investments can expose you to equity-like risk and leave you with a more volatile portfolio. Investing too much in such volatile assets could mean that in a down year, you’d end up having to tap the principal you were trying so hard to preserve. You may fail to diversify. Most portfolios should have a mix of growth and income investments. The growth piece offers the potential for the principal to appreciate faster than inflation. The income piece, of course, provides money to live on. Trying to eke out a reasonable living from dividends and bond income may necessitate dedicating a disproportionate share of your portfolio to fixed income, making the overall mix less diversified and paradoxically—since bonds are often viewed as safe, conservative investments—riskier because it may not keep pace with inflation. You may not generate enough to support your lifestyle. Our hypothetical $1 million portfolio was able to generate a $50,000 retirement “paycheck” through a combination of dividends, interest, and asset sales. Removing asset sales from that calculation would leave you well short of your funding goal—which could translate to a very different retirement lifestyle. Get the facts—and help Again, the goal of a total return approach is growing and producing enough income to outpace your spending needs. That assumes you’re starting out with an appropriate mix of investments to provide properly diversified sources of return. To make sure you’re starting from a good place, consider sitting down with a professional to determine how much income your portfolio is likely to produce each year through interest and dividend payments. Compare that to your yearly income needs. The difference between those two amounts is what you’ll cover through the sale of assets and rebalancing.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'When a baby is born, parents face a whole host of new expenses. Saving for their child’s college education—which, like retirement, benefits greatly from early action—may not be high on their list of priorities. At the same time, grandparents are often eager to help out financially. In such instances, a grandparent-owned 529 college savings plan can be just what the doctor ordered. Assets in state-sponsored 529s have the potential for growth that is tax-deferred, and withdrawals are exempt from federal taxes when used for qualified education expenses. As an added benefit, you may also be able to deduct contributions on your state taxes: The District of Columbia and 34 states offer a full or partial tax credit or deduction for in-state contributions to their 529 plans, and Arizona and Kansas offer a full or partial tax deduction to any state’s plan.1 Not only that, but grandparent-owned 529 assets aren’t factored into the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®), which helps determine eligibility for grants, work-study programs, and loans. With parent-owned 529s, on the other hand, 5.64% of assets are counted.2 Under current FAFSA rules, once a distribution from any nonparent-owned 529 plan is made, up to 50% of those funds must be reported as untaxed income on a student’s future financial aid applications. Federal financial aid calculations count such distributions only from the “prior-prior year”—that is, two tax years before the funds were distributed. Hence, delaying distributions from nonparent-owned accounts until the final two years of a child’s college career can help sidestep this potential pitfall. Change on the Horizon With the passage of the FAFSA Simplification Act (part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, enacted by Congress in December 2020), the new FAFSA form will not require funds from grandparent-owned 529s—as well as gifts—to be reported. This change may not happen until the 2024–2025 school year, so you’ll have to wait at least a year to benefit from the “prior-prior year” rule mentioned above. Take note, however, that a grandparent-owned 529 will likely continue to be considered on the College Scholarship Service Profile (CSS Profile™) application used for institution-specific financial aid. If you time it right, you can help a grandchild pay for college with a grandparent-owned 529 without affecting financial aid eligibility. 1 For a complete list of deductibility by state, see finaid.org/savings/state529deductions.phtml. 2 Assets and income may be excluded from calculations if below certain thresholds.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I\\'m 62, my wife is 53, and we have 14-year-old twins. My income has dropped precipitously, and I\\'m looking for a way to fill in the gap. Could applying now for Social Security benefits make sense? —A Reader Dear Reader, I\\'m glad you raised this question because it touches on a widely misunderstood component of the Social Security system: family benefits. Unlike survivor benefits—which are paid to eligible beneficiaries upon your passing—family benefits are paid to eligible family members during your lifetime. Even better, family benefits don\\'t eat into your benefit; on the contrary, they can significantly boost your family\\'s total payout. While it generally makes the most sense to delay claiming Social Security benefits if you can afford to wait and are in good health, family benefits can make claiming early an attractive option. That said, the rules regarding family benefits are complex—but understanding the basics can help you and your family capture all available benefits. Who\\'s eligible—and when First things first: You have to file for your own benefit before your family members can collect against it. From there, your family members can collect against your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)—or what your Social Security benefit would be at full retirement age (between 66 and 67 for today’s retirees)—provided they fall into one of three categories: Spouses age 62 or older, who can collect from 32.5% to 50% of your PIA based on when they file (see \"Patience pays\" below). Spouses of any age, who can collect 50% of your PIA, provided you’ve been married at least one year and have a child under the age of 16 (or a child of any age in your care who was disabled before age 22). Children—including adopted, biological, and stepchildren, as well as grandchildren for whom you’re the legal guardian—who can collect 50% of either parent’s PIA, provided they\\'re unmarried and: Younger than 18. Younger than 19 and a full-time K–12 student. Any age, if disabled before age 22. Patience pays The longer your spouse waits to collect either 50% of your benefit or 100% of her own, the bigger her benefit will be. Source: Social Security Administration. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. Assumes a PIA of $2,000 for the higher-earning spouse and a PIA of $900 for his wife based on her own work record. Note: Unlike benefits earned against an individual’s own work record, spousal benefits do not increase past full retirement age. Figures are in today’s dollars and assume no future increases in prices or earnings. So, assuming you filed for Social Security at age 62, your spouse at age 53 would be eligible to receive 50% of your PIA until your twins turn 16. At that point, her benefit would stop. If your wife is eligible for her own Social Security benefit and waits until her full retirement age, she would receive either 100% of her benefit or 50% of yours—whichever is larger. If she claims either her or your Social Security benefit before her full retirement age, her benefit would be reduced accordingly. Maximum family benefit While the numbers may look good so far, there\\'s a limit on the total benefit your family can collect. This family maximum benefit is between 150% and 188% of the primary earner\\'s PIA (the Social Security Administration uses a complex formula to determine the final amount). If the sum of your benefit and your family’s benefits exceeds this amount, their payments—though not yours—would be uniformly reduced to meet the cap. For example, if the benefit for your wife and your twins exceeds the maximum by $1,200, each of their monthly payments would be cut by $400, while yours would remain the same. Next steps As you can see, the family benefit rules within Social Security are complex but worth understanding. Your Social Security Statement can tell you how much you and your family would receive, or you can call the Social Security Administration at 800-772-1213. You can also call 800-355-2162 to talk to a Schwab financial consultant about how Social Security fits into your financial plan. What about ex-spouses? An ex-spouse who was married to you for at least 10 years, is 62 or older, and is currently unmarried is also eligible to collect up to 50% of what your Social Security benefit would be at full retirement age. Rest assured, however, that your ex-spouse\\'s payouts have absolutely no impact on your—or your family\\'s—benefits. An ex-spouse who was married to you for at least 10 years, is 62 or older, and is currently unmarried is also eligible to collect up to 50% of what your Social Security benefit would be at full retirement age.

       "   'abstract': 'Working from home could present tax challenges for some workers—and business owners.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the share of America’s labor force working from home was on the rise. The number of people who regularly work from home increased 216% between 2005 and 2019, while the number of employers who offer the option of working from home is up 40% from five years ago.1 And as U.S. employees slowly return to the office, 82% would prefer a hybrid approach, telecommuting about half the time.2 Those who work from home cite a number of benefits, including reduced commuter expenses and increased schedule flexibility. Employers, too, report several benefits, including higher employee retention and reduced overhead expenses. But there are drawbacks—most notably the additional bookkeeping and tax-filing requirements that can arise from people working from home in a state different from the one where their business office is physically located or operates. If you work from home—or employ people who do—here are four tax issues to be mindful of. 1. Withholding tax from wages Working from home has afforded a lot of people the ability to move to a new state and is becoming more common in metro areas and smaller cities alike. This can create withholding errors if you don’t alert your payroll department right away of your new residence. That’s because workers are required to have taxes withheld in accordance with their state’s tax rules, regardless of where their employer is located. Failure to update your withholding could result in a big tax bill—and even underpayment penalties—come Tax Day. Be aware, too, that some states also require employers to withhold taxes from nonresident employees’ wages. The state of New York, for example, requires employers to withhold state income tax from nonresidents’ wages. 2. Filing returns in multiple states If you work in two or more states, you may be required to file a tax return for each state. That’s because many states require nonresident employees to pay state income taxes if they earned money within that state, regardless of where they live. Some go so far as to require a tax return if you worked in their state in any fashion, including for a business trip. If you live or work in one of the nine U.S. states that do not charge income tax—Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming—you won’t be required to report and pay income tax to that state. 3. Deducting business expenses The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated many miscellaneous tax deductions, including unreimbursed business expenses, through 2025. That means any out-of-pocket expenses you incur while working from home that aren’t reimbursed by your employer cannot be deducted from your taxes. (Under previous tax law, workers could deduct certain out-of-pocket work-related expenses that exceeded 2% of their adjusted gross income. The deduction is scheduled to return in 2026.) If you’re self-employed, however, many business expenses can still be deducted on Schedule C of your Form 1040. 4. Employing workers in multiple states If you own a business in one state but have an employee working remotely in another, you may be required to register your business in that employee’s home state, as well as pay estimated taxes, file tax returns, and fulfill other reporting obligations to that state. If you find yourself in such a situation, be sure to work through the details with a qualified tax professional who can advise you on the various state and federal tax laws. The bottom line Taxes are always complicated, but the recent shift to working from home makes it all the more important to understand your tax obligations—whether as an employee or an employer. If any of the above scenarios apply to you, be sure to meet with a tax advisor who can help you navigate the intricacies of this complex situation. 1 “Latest Work-At-Home/Telecommuting/Mobile Work/Remote Work Statistics,” GlobalWorkplaceAnalytics.com, 08/19/2021, https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics. 2Ibid.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Consider these five strategies for handling an old 401(k).',\n",
       "   'content': 'Changing jobs? Here are five ways to handle the money in your employer-sponsored 401(k) plan. 1. Leave it in your current 401(k) plan The pros: If your former employer allows it, you can leave your money where it is. Your savings have the potential for growth that is tax-deferred, you’ll pay no taxes until you start making withdrawals, and you’ll retain the right to roll over or withdraw the funds at any point in the future. The cons: You’ll no longer be able to contribute to the plan, and the plan provider may charge additional fees because you’re no longer an employee. Managing multiple tax-deferred accounts can also prove complicated. The IRS mandates required minimum distributions (RMDs) annually from all such accounts beginning at age 72 (assuming you’re no longer working for the employer sponsoring the account). Fail to calculate the correct amount across multiple accounts, and the IRS will slap you with a 50% penalty on the shortfall. 2. Roll it into a new 401(k) plan The pros: Assuming you like the new plan’s costs, features, and investment choices, this can be a good option. Your savings have the potential for growth that is tax-deferred, and RMDs may be delayed beyond age 72 if you continue to work at the company sponsoring the plan. The cons: You’ll need to liquidate your current 401(k) investments and reinvest them in your new 401(k) plan’s investment offerings. The money will be subject to your new plan’s withdrawal rules, so you may not be able to withdraw it until you leave your new employer. 3. Roll it into a traditional individual retirement account (IRA) The pros: Because IRAs aren’t sponsored by employers—you own them directly—you won’t have to worry about making changes to your account should you change jobs again in the future. IRA providers may also offer a wider array of investment options and services than either your old or new employer-sponsored plan. The cons: Once you roll your funds into an IRA, they may no longer be eligible for a future rollover into a 401(k) plan, and RMDs apply at age 72, regardless of whether you’re employed. Also, you’ll need to specify how the funds in your traditional IRA are to be invested. Until you do so, the money will remain in cash or a cash equivalent, such as a money market account, rather than invested. 4. Convert into a Roth IRA The pros: Withdrawals are entirely tax-free in retirement, provided you’re over age 59½ and have held the account for five years or more. Roth IRAs are also exempt from RMDs. The cons: Because Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, you’ll have to pay taxes on your existing 401(k) funds at the time of the conversion. A Roth IRA must be open for five years in order to withdraw earnings tax-free, and you’ll be subject to a 10% penalty if you withdraw any money before you’re 59½ without an exemption. 5. Cash out The pros: In a word: liquidity. If you leave your job during or after the year you turn 55, you can withdraw money directly from your 401(k) without early withdrawal penalties. The cons: Withdrawals are subject to mandatory 20% federal withholding and, in some cases, mandatory state withholding. However, if you fail to move the money into a qualified retirement plan within 60 days, it is taxed as ordinary income, plus a 10% penalty if you’re under age 59½, which means you could end up paying significantly more than 20%, depending on your federal and state income tax rates. You may also negatively impact your retirement goals.'}],\n",

       "   'content': 'Not every worker fits the classic 9-to-5 mold. In fact, millions of Americans identify as self-employed, part-time workers, or homemakers, bucking traditional career paths either by circumstance or choice. And while saving for retirement may be more of a challenge without a steady paycheck, that doesn’t mean you should lose sight of your financial future. “Time is fleeting, and you don’t want to regret not putting away even small amounts when you can,” says Chris Kawashima, CFP®, a senior research analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “Even if you go against the grain with a more untraditional way of work, you can still stay on track for retirement.” Here are some different financial situations that might relate to your current household—and how to keep on track to reach your retirement goals. You want to ditch the 9-to-5 If you’re ready for a new stage in life, abandoning a traditional job is no reason to also abandon good financial sense—or your retirement goals. “Before changing careers or that steady line of work, ask yourself: Do you have the assets to carry you through the transition?” Chris says. Making the leap from financial security to a less predictable path requires preparation. It’s important to have an emergency fund for three to six months’ expenses. If you’re starting a business you may want to increase that amount to double—or even more— before taking the leap from stable employment. “If you’re starting a business, it’s not only about your own personal expenses you need to support during the transition,” Chris warns. “Your business may require you to take on overhead expenses as well as any one-time costs needed to get you up and running.” Once you have established your personal safety net, you can start thinking about where to put away what income you can. Contractors and self-employed workers have options to save for retirement, including starting your own individual 401(k), a SEP IRA, or a SIMPLE IRA. Compared to traditional IRAs, these retirement savings plans provide the potential to save more and reduce taxable income. If you max out one of these plans, you can still put additional retirement savings into a personal IRA. If you’re not starting a business, but are working for a company on a part-time or temporary basis, check to see if a company retirement plan is available to you. With the current employment demand, more employers are allowing part-time workers to contribute to employer-sponsored 401(k) plans. If that’s the case for your company, sign up during the next open enrollment period or when you become eligible, and try to contribute enough to get the full match, if available. If a company plan is not available to you, earned income from part-time work—including tips, professional fees, and self-employed income—allows you to open, and contribute to, your own IRA. By contributing to your own IRA, you may be able to get a tax deduction on the amount you contribute. You’re not working, but your spouse is If you’re part of a single-income household, you might be able to still contribute to an IRA without any earned income. Enter the spousal IRA. It’s not a different IRA type, but simply a traditional or Roth IRA that lets a nonworking spouse have access to the tax benefits of one. The account is not jointly owned and is a separate one set up in your own name. “A spousal IRA can be a great tool if the working member of the household has the income to spare,” Chris says. “You can save and invest more, and you may be able to get a tax deduction and potential tax credit on the contribution.” There are some important rules to keep in mind with a spousal IRA: You must be married and file a joint tax return in order to open one. Typical IRA income and contribution limits apply, and the total contributions of your IRAs can’t be more than the taxable income reported on your joint return. You’re in a tight spot Even if your budget is tight, chances are you can still put aside something—even a small amount. “To save at all with an unstable or low income is a tremendous amount of work,” Chris says, “but with the right mindset, savings can simply become a part of your budget.” For example, you could try making your savings automatic and out-of-sight like a subscription service, putting away $20 at first each month into a savings account or IRA. Then, if you find that’s comfortable, gradually increase that amount to fit in with the rest of your budget. “Everyone has a sweet spot where they can fund toward their future and take care of the bills. And Uncle Sam can help,” Chris says. If you’re a lower-income taxpayer, you might be eligible for a Saver’s Credit—a tax credit worth up to $1,000 for singles or $2,000 if you’re married and filing jointly. You’re eligible for the credit if you’re 18 years old or older, not claimed as a dependent on another person’s return and not a student. The percentage of your contribution that you can claim depends on your income level and filing status, so check carefully to see how you might qualify. Bottom line Regardless of the reasons, financial uncertainty is a familiar state for millions of Americans. “You can’t put off planning for your future until the perfect moment arrives,” says Chris, “Because there is no perfect moment. Saving a little bit now is always better than waiting and saving nothing.”'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My daughter is a junior in high school. When my eldest daughter applied to college a few years a years ago, she didn’t qualify for any financial aid. Is it worth applying again? It seems like such a hassle. —A Reader Dear Reader, My quick answer to your question, even without knowing the particulars of your situation, is a resounding ‘yes!’ Every year, thousands of eligible families don\\'t apply for financial aid for a variety of reasons: they think they won’t qualify, they believe the process is too time-consuming or difficult, or they simply aren’t aware of the possibilities. The unfortunate result is that by failing to apply, they could leave thousands of dollars on the table—not only in the form of scholarships and grants, but also in federally subsidized loans, work-study programs, and state- or school-specific packages. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) is the gateway to all of these opportunities, so I definitely encourage you to file promptly. It’s probably easier than you think The first thing to recognize is that completing the FAFSA has gotten a lot easier in the last few years—much easier than doing your taxes. According to the IRS, filing taxes takes the average taxpayer around eight hours, but it takes most people less than an hour to complete the FAFSA, start to finish. You can reduce potential errors and speed processing time by using the new IRS Data Retrieval Tool to import IRS Form 1040 federal tax return information when you complete the FAFSA online rather than mailing your application. FAFSA considers income from \"prior-prior\" or last year’s tax return filing (for example, if your daughter is going to school in the Fall of 2024, it will be based on your 2022 tax return). Or if you prefer a mobile app, the FAFSA form is also available on the myStudentAid app, available on the App Store (iOS) or on Google Play (Android). Don’t assume you won’t qualify While it’s true that financial aid is geared to help students most in need, many upper middle class and affluent families may still qualify. Not all financial aid is need-based, and different programs will have different asset and income criteria. It’s also true that you may now qualify if there have been changes to your financial circumstances. For example, if you now have more than one child in college, this can make a big difference in your eligibility for aid. Other significant changes might include divorce, loss of a job, or financial issues as a result of COVID-19. Therefore, don’t assume you’re not eligible—it’s better to apply and see. After all, your chances of receiving aid if you don’t apply are zero! You can also use FAFSA4caster to estimate eligibility for federal aid. It helps to be organized Your first step is to apply for a FAFSA ID, which can take one-three days. You’ll use this username and password to start the FAFSA and to act as your signature. Then, to make things easier as you fill out the form, gather necessary information. Along with your Social Security number (or Alien Registration Number) you’ll need financial information including bank and investment statements and income documentation for your salary, child support, alimony, interest and dividends, or VA benefits. Some of this income may be untaxable, but will still need to be included. Next come your assets. IRAs, 401(k)s, qualified pensions and annuities aren’t considered available or “reportable” assets. Your primary residence, family farm, certain small businesses, life insurance and personal possessions like cars also are not considered. 529 College Savings Plans and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts are only partially considered, which is one of the reasons they’re a great way to save for college. Last, you’ll want a list of schools you’re interested in. Include all that you’re considering (you can list up to ten at one time), even if you haven’t applied or think you might change your mind. You can find out about colleges: their programs, costs, admissions, results, and more at College Scorecard. You’ll hear directly from the schools in a few weeks. Aid comes in lots of flavors The FAFSA is the main gateway to much more than need-based grants or scholarships. In fact, the FAFSA also opens the door to work-study opportunities and federally subsidized loans. In addition, many schools use the FAFSA for their own non-federal aid programs, as do many private and state organizations. Every family looks different The FAFSA is designed to accommodate every type of family. If parents are divorced or if there is a step-parent, you can use this guide to see which parent’s information you should include. Older students who no longer live with their parents can file on their own (without parental information) if they can answer ‘yes’ to any one of these questions. Otherwise, they’re still considered a dependent for purposes of federal student aid even if they don’t live with their parents, aren’t claimed by their parents on their tax forms, or are paying their own bills and educational expenses. Be an early bird My final piece of advice is to apply as soon as the FAFSA becomes available on October 1. Even though the federal cutoff is June 30, your state or schools may have different deadlines. Because some forms of aid are limited and made available on a first come, first served basis, it’s best to be at the front of the line. Looking to the future, you\\'ll need to file an updated FAFSA every year your student is in school. Fortunately, some of your information will automatically carry over; it will be up to you to supply personal and financial updates that may impact your award, whether that’s positive or negative. A college education can be a life-changing opportunity. In fact, studies have shown that a college degree can translate into greater career opportunities, increased lifetime earnings, and enhanced life satisfaction. Fortunately, many different forms of aid can help offset the financial burden for millions of students who come from strikingly different backgrounds. It behooves students and families to take maximum advantage of this aid by filing the FAFSA with care and on time. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'It’s been 35 years since I began my career on Wall Street and the lessons I learned along the way from some all-time investment greats always hold true.',\n",
       "   'content': 'It was 35 years ago this month that I began my career on Wall Street. In thinking about those three-and-a-half decades, I decided to shift tack with today\\'s report and ask readers to indulge me as I ruminate about what I\\'ve learned during these decades. I am often asked about the influences that have shaped me and my career; and they take many forms—including the iconic investors for whom I\\'ve worked, the memorable books and research I\\'ve pored over countless times, and the most valuable lessons they\\'ve imparted along the way. My favorite quip ever said about the stock market was by Sir John Templeton. I had the great pleasure of meeting John many years ago when he appeared as a guest on Wall $treet Week With Louis Rukeyser (more on that below), when I was a panelist. He perfectly summed up what really drives the stock market—notably not using a single word that isn\\'t directly tied to investors\\' emotional state: \"Bull markets are born on pessimism, they grow on skepticism, they mature on optimism and they die on euphoria.\" Some of the messages imbedded in Templeton\\'s most famous quote—as well as in those below—are even more important to ponder given today\\'s lofty valuations and not-so-subtle signs of investor complacency. There is nothing wrong with rejoicing in bull markets; but we must always remember that they do eventually end, so heed the messages from some of the greats of finance. It was 1986 … Thanks to admittedly heavy doses of luck and right-place-right-time, I started my career working for the late-great Marty Zweig and his partner Ned Babbitt at Avatar Associates. Within my first week on the job—as a \"portfolio assistant\" (aka, grunt)—Marty gave me a book that I still have, and still recommend every time someone asks me about my favorite investing books. It\\'s a must read for anyone, like me, who understands that it\\'s psychology that best defines market behavior. Reminiscences of a Stock Operator was written by Edwin LeFevre and was first published in 1923. It is a fictionalized biography of Jesse Livermore, an actual legendary trader and speculator of that era. Below are some of the most memorable passages from that dog-eared book sitting on my shelf: Edwin LeFevre \"Fear and hope remain the same; therefore the study of the psychology of speculators is as valuable as it ever was. Weapons change, but strategy remains strategy, on the New York Stock Exchange as on the battlefield.\" \"The sucker has always tried to get something for nothing, and the appeal in all booms is always frankly to the gambling instinct aroused by cupidity and spurred by a pervasive prosperity. People who look for easy money invariably pay for the privilege of proving conclusively that it cannot be found on this sordid earth.\" \"Speculators buy the trend; investors are in for the long haul; \\'they are a different breed of cats.\\' One reason that people lose money today is that they have lost sight of this distinction; they profess to have the long term in mind and yet cannot resist following where the hot money has led.\" \"Never try to sell at the top. It isn\\'t wise. Sell after a reaction if there is no rally.\" \"…there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can\\'t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again.\" Marty Zweig When Marty sadly passed away in 2013, I wrote a tribute to him as one of these bi-weekly missives, which long-time readers may remember. Marty may be most famous for perfectly calling the Crash of \\'87 on precisely the Friday night before that fateful Monday, October 19, 1987 (\"Black Monday\"). He did so on the legendary PBS show Wall $treet Week With Louis Rukeyser—a show I would join as a regular panelist 10 years later. Some readers (let\\'s just say of the more \"seasoned\" variety) might remember that prescient conversation between Marty and Lou; and thanks to YouTube, anyone can watch it. Marty is also famous for coining two phrases that have become ingrained in many investors\\' heads: \"Don\\'t fight the Fed\" and \"Never fight the tape.\" Here is what he had to say about both; some of which were in his bestselling 1986 book Winning on Wall Street: \"In the stock market, as with horse racing, money makes the mare go.\" \"Big money is made in the stock market by being on the right side of major moves. I don\\'t believe in swimming against the tide. The idea is to get in harmony with the market. It\\'s suicidal to fight trends. They have a higher probability of continuing than not.\" \"It\\'s OK to be wrong; it\\'s unforgivable to stay wrong.\" \"I measure what\\'s going on, and I adapt to it. I try to get my ego out of the way. The market is smarter than I am, so I bend.\" \"Patience is one of the most valuable attributes in investing.\" Louis Rukeyser I miss Marty every day. I also miss Lou Rukeyser, who not only single-handedly introduced me to the world of financial media; but gave me some of the sagest advice I\\'ve ever received. During the preamble to the very first interview I did with Lou in 1997, he asked about my parents and whether they were \"financial folks,\" to which I responded no. He then took my hands in his and said, \"when you come out on set in 15 minutes to have our interview, get them to understand what you\\'re talking about.\" I try to live those words every single day in my role at Schwab. Lou was also known for his humorous monologues every Friday night, including some of his most memorable quips: \"In Wall Street, the only thing that\\'s hard to explain is next week.\" \"I never make a prediction that can be proved wrong within 24 hours.\" \"The best way to keep money in perspective is to have some.\" But the one I\\'ll never forget is what Lou said on the Friday immediately following the Crash of \\'87: \"It\\'s just your money. It\\'s not your life. The figures on a broker\\'s report mean little compared to that. The people who loved you a week ago still love you today.\" Quintessential investing books Throughout those early years in my career, I read many a classic investing tome written by true legends. I try to pick each of them up from time to time to separate myself from the often-manic noise of the day-to-day reading and research with which we\\'re all bombarded. Though not an exhaustive list, they include: A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton G. Malkiel, first published in 1973 The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, first published in 1949 The Money Game by Adam Smith (pseudonym for George Goodman), first published in 1976 Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles Mackay, first published in 1841 Against the Gods by Peter L. Bernstein, first published in 1996 I could fill dozens of pages with memorable quotes from these spectacular books; but in keeping with the themes around speculation, here are some of my favorites: Burton G. Malkiel \"Forecasts are difficult to make—particularly those about the future.\" \"It\\'s not hard to make money in the market. What is hard to avoid is the alluring temptation to throw your money away on short, get-rich-quick speculative binges. It is an obvious lesson, but one frequently ignored.\" \\'…there are four factors that create irrational market behavior: overconfidence, biased judgments, herd mentality, and loss aversion.\" \"Human nature likes order; people find it hard to accept the notion of randomness. No matter what the laws of chance might tell us, we search for patterns among random events wherever they might occur—not only in the stock market but even in interpreting sporting phenomena.\" Benjamin Graham \"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" \"Abnormally good or abnormally bad conditions do not last forever.\" \"You will be much more in control, if you realize how much you are not in control.\" \"The investor\\'s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself.\" \"…while enthusiasm may be necessary for great accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invariably leads to disaster.\" \"An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.\" \"If the reason people invest is to make money, then in seeking advice they are asking others to tell them how to make money. That idea has some element of naivete.\" Adam Smith (George Goodman) \"If you don\\'t know who you are, this is an expensive place to find out.\" \"The first thing you have to know is yourself. A man who knows himself can step outside himself and watch his own reactions like an observer.\" \"When the Rothschilds got the word about the battle of Waterloo—in the movie it was by carrier pigeon—they didn\\'t rush down and buy British consols, the government bonds. They rushed in and sold, and then, in the panic, they bought.\" \"The irony is that this is a money game and money is the way we keep score. But the real object of the Game is not money, but it is the playing of the Game itself. For the true players, you could take all the trophies away and substitute plastic beads or whales\\' teeth; as long as there is a way to keep score, they will play.\" Charles Mackay \"Men, it has been well said, think in herds. It will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.\" \"Let us not, in the pride of our superior knowledge, turn with contempt from the follies of our predecessors. The study of the errors into which great minds have fallen in the pursuit of truth can never be uninstructive.\" Peter L. Bernstein \"Risk and time are opposite sides of the same coin, for if there were no tomorrow there would be no risk. Time transforms risk, and the nature of risk is shaped by the time horizon: the future is the playing field.\" \"Time matters most when decisions are irreversible. And yet many irreversible decisions must be made on the basis of incomplete information.\" \"We are prisoners of the future because we will be ensnared by our past.\" \"The information you have is not the information you want. The information you want is not the information you need. The information you need is not the information you can obtain. The information you can obtain costs more than you want to pay.\" \"You never get poor by taking a profit.\" \"Vast ills have followed a belief in certainty.\" Bob Farrell During my 13 years at Zweig/Avatar, I was on the \"buy side\" managing money; and was the recipient of most of traditional Wall Street\\'s vast amount of \"sell side\" research. I was an admirer of many seasoned investment strategists during that time; and it planted the seed that would eventually grow into the role I\\'ve had at Schwab for more than two decades. In addition to Marty giving me Reminiscences of a Stock Operator to read; he also pointed me to the work of Bob Farrell; who was Merrill Lynch\\'s chief stock market analyst and senior investment advisor for 45 years; having studied fundamental analysis under (Benjamin) Gramm and (David L.) Dodd. Bob is immortalized by his rules of investing that are still quoted widely by investment professionals—and ring as true today as ever: Markets tend to return to the mean over time. Excesses in one direction will lead to an opposite excess in the other direction. There are no new eras—excesses are never permanent. Exponential rapidly rising or falling markets usually go further than you think, but they do not correct by going sideways. The public buys the most at the top and the least at the bottom. Fear and greed are stronger than long-term resolve. Markets are strongest when they are broad and weakest when they narrow to a handful of blue-chip names. Bear markets have three stages—sharp down, reflexive rebound and a drawn-out fundamental downtrend. When all the experts and forecasts agree—something else is going to happen. Bull markets are more fun than bear markets. Charles Schwab, the company I left Zweig/Avatar in mid-1999 to join U.S. Trust, which was acquired by Charles Schwab a short 10 months later. That acquisition was part of the evolution of Schwab away from its discount brokerage heritage to its expansion into a wealth management and brokerage powerhouse. With that acquisition, as I often say, I was figuratively adopted by the parent company, and my role was born. Chuck Schwab, the man Chuck has had an extraordinary influence on me personally, and my career. His optimism is infectious, and his character unrivaled in our business. One of my all-time favorite sentiments expressed by Chuck was about his people: \"I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticism from superiors.\" \"I have yet to find the person, however great or exalted his station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do under a spirit of criticism.\" I have worked under Chuck\\'s spirit of approval and encouragement for more than 20 years; for which I\\'ll be eternally grateful. Two years ago, Chuck wrote a deeply personal memoir. In Invested Chuck tells a \"remarkable story of a company succeeding by challenging norms and conventions through decades of change.\" I had the great honor of hitting the road with Chuck on his book tour after it was published. During those conversations on stages around the country—as well as our many conversations over the past two decades—there are facets to his character and beliefs that have always guided me as I\\'ve traversed my path at Schwab. One of our shared beliefs is the inability to time markets with any precision. Too many investors believe the key to success is knowing what\\'s going to happen in the market, and then positioning accordingly. But the reality is that it\\'s not what we know that makes us successful investors; it\\'s what we do. In Invested, Chuck wrote: \"If I had learned anything after years in the business, it was how little I could ever know about what the market would do tomorrow.\" I especially loved how Chuck closed the final chapter of Invested: \"Business is a creative process. You move forward into the unknowable future, try new things, make discoveries along the way, and repeat. It’s all about learning and growth. It is why I love it and the free market of ideas that enables it and makes so many great new things possible. I like to say business is organic, like life itself, ever changing. It is the human spirit of curiosity and creativity brought to life, and why I am ever optimistic about the future.\" Well said, Chuck. Relevance I\\'ve written a number of reports recently that detail a growing set of risks with which the market is facing. They include the aforementioned speculative froth at various points this year—concentrated in a rotating crop of non-traditional market segments, like meme stocks, SPACs, non-profitable \\'tech\\' stocks, cryptocurrencies, IPOs, etc. Drawdowns this year in those areas have ranged from -30% to -80%. Perhaps because many of these \"micro bubbles\" sit outside traditional benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 helps explain the relative resiliency of the market. Other risks include stretched valuations; monetary and fiscal policy concerns; slowing growth and not-yet-transitory inflation; and the recent/ongoing deterioration in the stock market\\'s \"internals\" (breadth). In fact, for all the cheering about the S&P 500 not having had even a 5% drawdown this year; it might surprise readers to know that 86% of the index\\'s constituents have had at least a 10% correction this year. As highlighted above via the words of investment legends, investors should be cognizant of heightened risks. Heed the risk/reward benefits of diversification (across and within asset classes) and rebalancing. Try to divine whether there is a gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance. Those gaps can be surprisingly wide and often only discovered during tumultuous market periods. \"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\"'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'One key component of an investment strategy is a diversified portfolio. Here are three ways you can kickstart your portfolio no matter your investment style.',\n",
       "   'content': \"A recent study1 found that most new investors were surprised to learn that investing is more about long-term, rather than short-term wins. So, how do you position yourself for long-term success? Start by building a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance,2 time frame, and how involved you want to be in managing your investments. Diversification helps spread your money across different assets, just in case one of your investments doesn't perform as well as you thought it would. Your risk tolerance is generally your comfort level to withstand wide fluctuations with your investment's value (volatility)—not all investments go up or down in value in the same way. If your tolerance for risk is low, meaning it's hard for you to stomach large swings in value, you'll probably want to build a conservative portfolio, balancing your stock investments with buying more no- or low-volatility assets like bonds, CDs, or cash. On the other hand, if long-term, higher growth is your goal, you might be able to afford—literally and figuratively—to stack your portfolio with riskier investments because of greater potential opportunity to recover your losses. If you're unsure of your investment style, you can assess your appropriate investment balance3 by answering a few simple questions about your risk tolerance and time horizon to develop an investment strategy. However, be careful about making your assessment when the markets are up. Good markets tend to give people a false sense of confidence to take on greater risk than they're really comfortable with. Once you know your risk tolerance, here are three ways to kickstart your diversified portfolio. 1. Start with the familiar Most newer investors are familiar with stocks, so consider starting there. Stocks, or equities, represent a share of ownership in a company. Because their value generally hinges on the performance of the business, they tend to offer a greater opportunity for growth in your portfolio—unlike fixed income and cash investments that can help provide more reliable, steady returns. The trade-off is that, as much as stocks have the potential to produce bigger profits, earnings aren't guaranteed, and you may even lose money. Regardless, even the most conservative investor would likely want to allocate a portion of their portfolio to stocks. In our model portfolios below, a conservative allocation invests 20% in stocks whereas an aggressive portfolio consists of 95% stocks. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. All models presented are hypothetical, are for illustrative purposes only, and cannot be invested in directly. Models are shown at the asset group level and not intended to represent a specific investment product. To select stocks that can help you achieve your long-term investment goals, one component you can use is a stock screener like Schwab Equity Ratings® to help take out some of the guesswork. Schwab Equity Ratings ranks approximately 3,000 U.S.-traded stocks on a scale from A to F based upon a disciplined, systematic approach that seeks to gauge investor expectations. Schwab's research outlook is that A-rated stocks are worth considering because they're expected to strongly outperform the equities market during the next 12 months. F-rated stocks, on the other hand, are predicted to strongly underperform, and you should consider not buying them or—if they're currently in your portfolio—selling them. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are another way to help build instant diversification because they bundle individual securities into one fund. However, you'll still need to monitor and adjust your portfolio on an ongoing basis according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. 2. Spend a little and learn a lot with fractional shares When you have a limited amount to invest, buying a whole share—let alone multiple shares—of a stock can seem out of reach. Fractional shares allow you to purchase a piece, or slice, of a share at a price you can afford. Fractional shares work the same as whole shares except you'll earn or lose the proportional amount relative to your holdings. Let's say you want to buy stock in a specific company whose price is $1,000 a share. You only have $100 to invest, so you purchase a 10% fractional share. If the price of the stock goes up to $1,150 (an increase of 15%), your fractional share will be worth $115—a gain of $15. If the price per share drops 25%, instead of losing $250, your loss is $25 in a fractional share. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. Be aware that fractional shares of every stock listed in the market may not be available for purchase. For example, Schwab Stock Slices™ allows you to invest in companies in the S&P 500® companies to start building a diversified stock portfolio for as little as $5 a slice. 3. Use a robo advisor to do the heavy lifting If you're new to investing, you can easily become overwhelmed by all the investment choices out there, or you might be tempted to act on your feelings instead of trusting the research. A robo advisor can help make some of those difficult decisions for you. Automated investing doesn't make a lot of demands on your time or attention. After you identify your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance, a robo advisor will build a diversified portfolio based on your investor profile. For example, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios® assembles a mix of ETFs, along with a cash allocation, selected by our experts. It then monitors market activity and automatically rebalances your allocations to keep your investments aligned with your goals. Although most of the work is done through sophisticated algorithms, you still have the option to contribute funds as you see fit. The robo advisor may even alert you if you're falling short of your goals so you can take action. For new investors, reacting to changing market conditions can be an emotional and costly decision. It's not always easy to keep a cool head if markets go haywire. A robo advisor is a way to invest while limiting the impact your emotions can have on your portfolio. Investing early is key Building long-term wealth should drive your investment strategy. That's why the earlier you start planning for the future, the better. Even small dollar amounts can grow if you remain disciplined and steadfast. Remember that achieving your goal takes time. Patience isn’t just a virtue—it's often a crucial character trait of successful investors. 1 Read study at aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021 2 Learn more about risk tolerance at schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/does-your-risk-tolerance-change-over-time 3 See how to assess your appropriate investment balance at schwab.com/public/file/P-778947\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Micro E-mini futures offer traders exposure to four leading U.S. stock indexes in bite-size contracts.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Index-tracking Micro E-mini Futures aim to make an advantage of smallness. What are they? Micro E-mini Futures are basically smaller versions of the CME Group’s popular E-mini stock index futures contracts, checking in at just 1/10th the size. The CME Group created them because the classic E-minis had become too expensive for many traders, effectively shutting them out of the liquid futures market. The smaller Micro contracts also give traders more flexibility and allows them to be more precise in how they manage their risks. Since their launch in 2019, Micro E-minis have allowed traders to take positions on the big four U.S. indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Russell 2000—without having to commit nearly as much capital as the regular contracts. For example, where the regular E-mini S&P 500 futures contract represents $50 times the price of the S&P 500 Index, the Micro E-mini S&P 500 represents $5 times the price of the S&P 500 Index. Let’s take a closer look at some of the potential benefits and risks associated with these contracts. What are the benefits? The Micro E-mini’s small size brings a variety of potential benefits to retail traders: Portfolio diversification for less: With futures, you can take on long or short exposure to an entire index of stocks for far less money than it would take to buy or short the same stocks or even the associated index-tracking funds. Capital efficiency: One of the key concepts of futures trading is that, as leveraged investments, a relatively small initial amount of capital is used to control a much larger contract amount. With Micro E-minis, a trader’s performance bond, or margin—a financial guarantee required of both buyers and sellers of futures contracts to ensure fulfillment of the contract—could run from just 5%–7% of the notional value of the contract. (The notional value is calculated by multiplying the size of the contract by the current price. For example, the Micro E-mini S&P 500 contract is $5 times the price of the index. If the index is trading at 4,255, the notional value of the Micro E-mini contract would be $21,275.) Flexible risk management: Selling Micro E-mini futures can help investors manage some of the risk associated with the stock allocation in their portfolios without actually disturbing their stock portfolios. Around the clock access: With trading available nearly 24 hours a day, six days a week, traders can respond to market moving events as they occur around the globe. What are the risks? As with any futures trading, if a trade goes against you, you may lose more money than you initially invested. (With a stock or bond, your potential loss is limited to the amount you invested.) In fact, any significant move against your position before expiry could lead to a margin call for you to settle. Under certain (rare) market conditions, you may also find it difficult—or impossible—to close out a position. This situation can occur, for example, when a market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit (limit-up or limit-down) or market circuit breaker. In addition, stop and market orders may not execute at or near your desired price during times of high volatility or low volume. Finally, while the nearly 24-hour trading in some products can be an advantage, it could also tempt traders and investors into making more trades than they can reasonably handle, creating the potential for larger losses. Futures trading is hard work and requires a substantial investment of time and energy. Studying charts, reading market commentary, staying on top of the news—it can be a lot for even the most seasoned trader. How do they work? The size of the contract refers to a contract multiplier. As noted above, Micro E-minis are one-tenth the size of an equivalent E-mini contract. For example, the S&P 500 Micro E-mini has a $5 multiplier, while the E-mini version has a $50 multiplier. This means traders will gain or lose $5 per point change in the Micro contract versus $50 per point with the regular mini contract. Micro E-mini contract multiplier for each index Index Micro E-mini contract E-mini contract size Micro E-mini contract size S&P 500 Micro E-mini S&P 500 futures (MES) $50 x S&P 500 Index $5 X S&P 500 Index Nasdaq-100 Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures (MNQ) $20 x Nasdaq-100 Index $2 X Nasdaq-100 Index Dow Jones Micro E-mini Dow futures (MYM) $5 x DJIA Index $.50 X DJIA Index Russell 2000 Micro E-mini Russell 2000 futures (M2K) $50 x Russell 2000 Index $5 X Russell 2000 Index Source cmegroup.com Like their E-mini counterparts, Micro E-mini futures trade on a March quarterly expiration cycle (third Friday of March, June, September, and December).

Here are some guidelines to consider. What\\'s full retirement age? Full retirement age (also known as \"normal retirement age\") is when you\\'re eligible to receive full Social Security benefits. Your full retirement age depends on your birth year: For anyone born in 1960 or later, full retirement age is 67. For those born in 1955 through to the end of 1959 (technically, January 1, 19601), full retirement age ranges between 66 and 2 months and 66 and 10 months. If you were born before 1955, you\\'ve already reached age 66 and full retirement age. Retirement ages for full Social Security benefits Source: SSA.gov What if I take benefits early? If you choose to take your own (not your spouse\\'s) Social Security benefit before your full retirement age, be aware that the benefit is permanently reduced by five-ninths of 1% for each month. If you start more than 36 months before your full retirement age, the worker benefit is further reduced by five-twelfths of 1% per month for the rest of retirement. For example, let\\'s assume you stop working at age 62. If your full retirement age is 67 and you elect to start benefits at age 62, the reduced benefit calculation is based on 60 months. So, the reduction for the first 36 months is 20% (five-ninths of 1% times 36) and then another 10% (five-twelfths of 1% times 24) for the remaining 24 months. Overall, your benefits would be permanently reduced by 30%.

If you retire sometime between your full retirement age and age 70, you typically earn a \"delayed retirement\" credit (DRC) for your own benefits (but not spousal benefits). For example, say you were born in 1960, and your full retirement age is 67. If you start your benefits at age 69, you would receive a credit of 8% per year multiplied by two (the number of years you waited). This means your benefit would be 16% higher than the amount you would have received at age 67. (This doesn\\'t include any potential additional cost of living adjustments for inflation from age 67 to 69.)

While it\\'s important to consider your personal circumstances—it\\'s not always possible to wait, particularly if you are in poor health or can\\'t afford to delay—the benefits of waiting can be significant. Be aware that if you decide to wait past age 65, you may still need to sign up for Medicare. In some circumstances your Medicare coverage may be delayed and cost more if you don\\'t sign up at age 65. If you start Social Security benefits early, you\\'ll automatically be enrolled into Medicare Parts A and B when you turn age 65. Your annual Social Security statement will list your projected benefits between age 62 to 70, assuming you continue to work and earn about the same amount through those ages. If you need a copy of your annual statement, you can request one or view it online on the Social Security Administration (SSA) portal. How should I decide when to take benefits? Consider the following factors as you decide when to take Social Security. Your cash needs If you\\'re contemplating early retirement and you have sufficient resources (an investment portfolio, a traditional pension, and other sources of income), you can be flexible about when to take Social Security benefits. If you\\'ll need your Social Security benefits to make ends meet, you may have fewer options. If possible, you may want to consider postponing retirement or working part-time until you reach your full retirement age—or even longer—so that you can maximize your benefits. Your life expectancy Taking Social Security early reduces your benefits, but you\\'ll also receive monthly checks for a longer period of time. On the other hand, taking Social Security later results in fewer checks during your lifetime, but delaying means each check will be larger. If you think you\\'ll beat the average life expectancy, then waiting for a larger monthly check might be a good deal. On the other hand, if you\\'re in poor health or have reason to believe you won\\'t beat the average life expectancy, you might decide to take what you can while you can. A quick note about life expectancy According to the SSA, the average life expectancy for a 65-year-old is around 84 years for males and 87 for females. Married individuals tend to live even longer, with a greater than average probability of at least one spouse living to age 90. To compute your own life expectancy, use the SSA\\'s life expectancy calculator. Remember, though, that the average is just that—an average. If you expect to have a shorter life expectancy, then early withdrawals might make sense. If you live longer than average, starting Social Security later can be particularly beneficial. Your marital status If you\\'re married, start by taking your spouse\\'s age, health, and benefits into account, particularly if they are the higher-earning spouse. For example, at full retirement age, you can take either 100% of your own retirement benefits or 50% of your spouse\\'s, whichever is higher. If you are divorced and you were married for 10 years or more, you can receive benefits based on your ex-spouse\\'s Social Security record (up to 50% of their full retirement benefits). Take note that if your ex-spouse uses your record, this won\\'t impact your or your current spouse\\'s benefits. If you\\'re widowed, you can receive either your own retirement benefits or up to 100% of your spouse\\'s benefits, whichever is higher. It\\'s important to make the most effective use of the combination of a worker, spousal, and survivor benefit, working with a financial planner if possible. Your employment status Earning a wage (or even self-employment income) can reduce your benefit temporarily if you take Social Security early. If you\\'re still working and you haven\\'t reached your full retirement age, $1 in benefits will be deducted for every $2 you earn above the annual limit ($19,560 in 2022). In the year you reach your full retirement age, the reduction falls to $1 in benefits for every $3 you earn above a higher limit ($51,960 in 2022). However, starting the month you hit your full retirement age, your benefits are no longer reduced no matter how much you earn. Again, any reduction in benefits due to the earnings test is only temporary. You receive the money back in the form of a recalculated higher benefit beginning at full retirement age, so don\\'t use the reduction as the sole reason to cut back on working or worry about earning too much. To wait or not to wait? Consider taking benefits earlier if . . . You are no longer working and can\\'t make ends meet without your benefits. You are in poor health and don\\'t expect the surviving member of the household to make it to average life expectancy. You are the lower-earning spouse, and your higher-earning spouse can wait to file for a higher benefit. Consider waiting to take benefits if . . . You are still working and make enough to impact the taxability of your benefits. (At least wait until your normal retirement age so benefits aren’t further reduced due to earnings.) Either you or your spouse are in good health and expect to exceed average life expectancy. You are the higher-earning spouse and want to be sure your surviving spouse receives the highest possible benefit. What about taxes on Social Security? Social Security benefits may be taxable, depending on your \"combined income.\" Your combined income is equal to your adjusted gross income (AGI), plus non-taxable interest payments (e.g., interest payments on tax-exempt municipal bonds), plus half of your Social Security benefit. As your combined income increases above a certain threshold (from earning a paycheck, for instance), more of your benefit is subject to income tax—up to a maximum of 85%. For help, talk with a CPA or tax professional. In any case, if you\\'re still working, you may want to postpone Social Security either until you reach your full retirement age or until your earned income is less than the annual limit. In no situation should you postpone benefits past age 70. What if I change my mind? If you receive Social Security benefits at a reduced rate but then change your mind, you have the option of withdrawing your application within the first 12 months of receiving benefits and paying back to the government what you\\'ve already received (including Medicare payments and taxes deducted). Then, you could restart benefits at a later date to take advantage of a higher payout. Be aware that you\\'re limited to one withdrawal per lifetime. For example, let\\'s say you elected to receive early benefits at age 62 but then decided to go back to work at age 63. You could withdraw your Social Security application, pay back the years\\' worth of benefits you received, go back to work, and then wait until your full retirement age to restart your benefit checks at a higher level. Once you reach full retirement age, another option is to voluntarily stop benefits at any point before age 70 to receive delayed retirement credits (spousal benefits will be stopped as well). Benefits will automatically restart at age 70 at a higher amount—unless you choose to start taking benefits before then. Note that when you withdraw your application or stop your benefits after full retirement age, you must specify if your Medicare coverage—if you have it—should be included in the withdrawal. What is the future of Social Security? As of June 2022, the Social Security Trust Fund is projected to have enough resources to cover all promised benefits until 2035 when, absent a change from Congress, benefits would need to be cut for all current and future beneficiaries to about 80% of scheduled benefits.2 Over the longer term, changes to the full retirement age or means testing—which could reduce or eliminate benefits based on your other income sources—may also be considered. If you\\'re skeptical about the future of Social Security or wary of potential changes, you may be tempted to start benefits early, assuming that it\\'s better to have something than nothing. Regardless of your situation, if you are concerned about the future prospects for Social Security, then that\\'s a good reason to save more—and earlier—for your retirement. The bottom line If you have a choice and are in good health, think seriously about waiting as long as you can to take your benefits (but no later than age 70). A long retirement coupled with uncertainty about markets and inflation are the biggest risks. Delaying Social Security, if you can, is effectively an insurance policy against those challenges. Your situation may differ, however, and there are many factors to consider. Get help from your financial planner if you need it. 1If your birthday is on the 1st of the month, the SSA determines your benefit and full retirement age as if your birthday were in the previous month (December of the year before if your birthday is on January 1). 2\"The 2022 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds\", Social Security Administration, 06/02/2022, https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2022/.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': \"There's an urgent need to educate our kids about money. Join us as we launch our new financial literacy program.\",\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Reader, As we once again send our children back to school, my mind immediately turns not to the three R's—but to the challenge we face as a country in educating our kids about money. I’ve been an advocate for financial literacy for over 20 years, and the longer I'm involved, the more convinced I become of its critical importance. If nothing else, the last year and a half has shown us the need to be financially prepared—whether that’s for unexpected events, to support our evolving goals and priorities, or to create equal opportunities for all, regardless of socioeconomic background. Unfortunately, though, too many of us had to learn on our own or wait until adulthood—when the stakes were already pretty high—to learn to think critically about our finances. Currently only 21 states require high school students to take a course in personal finance. This is a step in the right direction, but it leaves the vast majority of students, and especially low-income students, out in the cold. As a country we can—and must—do better. That's why I'm excited to announce the launch of Moneywise America, a groundbreaking financial literacy program that will marshal Schwab employee volunteers to provide high-quality financial education to teens across the country, with a focus on reaching youth in under-resourced communities. This new program builds on the 20 years of successful collaboration between the Charles Schwab Foundation and several of America's leading youth and community organizations, including the Council of Economic Education and Next Gen Personal Finance, providing financial education in communities with the greatest need. With Moneywise America we're reaching out even farther. Creating opportunity through financial literacy I’m passionate about financial literacy because it has the power to provide opportunities and change lives. Did you know that kids with savings accounts in their name are six times more likely to attend college? Or that a poor credit report can prevent you from getting an apartment, or even a job? Or that nearly one quarter of Americans have no retirement savings? These are just some of the issues that motivate me. With households increasingly responsible for their own financial welfare, lessons about saving, budgeting, preparing for the unexpected, developing goals and investing need to be learned early in life. Knowing and understanding how to manage money shouldn’t be a rarified skill or a ‘nice-to-have,’ but rather an essential life skill that helps us all live full and rewarding lives. We've decided to focus on teens in under-resourced communities so that we can begin to level the economic playing field and close the income and wealth gap. Unfortunately, too many of us learn about handling money by making mistakes. One of the chief goals of Moneywise America is to prevent financial missteps, which can be particularly devastating for individuals from vulnerable groups who also have to bear the financial repercussions of discrimination, underinvestment, and environmental and climate-related risks. The beginning of a lifelong journey I view financial literacy as a lifelong quest, a knowledge and skill base that we should begin to build when we’re young, and then continue to expand over time as our needs evolve and we gain experience. The first time you open a 401(k), it can feel like you’re entering a foreign land with obscure terminology and an overwhelming number of choices. Or the first time you buy a house, or even a car, the rigmarole can be overwhelming. As someone who's been a financial professional for over half of her life, I can honestly say I'm still learning as well—which is why I think of financial literacy as a lifelong journey. Our hope is that programs like Moneywise America will not only teach the fundamentals of money management, but also provide our students with the foundation and confidence they need to continue learning. We want to help them find the path that will lead to the future they choose, a future filled with possibilities. Let's make financial literacy the norm In 2020 Schwab fielded a national survey that showed Americans overwhelmingly recognize the importance of financial literacy for themselves as well as their children. The majority of respondents expressed regret they hadn’t learned how to manage money at a younger age. As a society, we have the ability to move the dial. As we roll out Moneywise America across the country in the coming months and years, we're excited to join forces with parents, teachers, and community leaders in this essential mission of educating and guiding our youth. To a large extent, our future as a more prosperous country—and our children’s futures as capable and fulfilled adults—is in our hands. Please stay tuned in the coming months as we share ways you can work with us in this essential endeavor. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Environmental, Social, and Governance investing (ESG) holds some emotional appeal for many investors. Having alignment between your investments and your personal values sounds good, but it is natural to ask if there\\'s a downside to ESG. Do you have to accept poor returns from your investments if you want them to be socially responsible? Is ESG riskier than non-ESG approaches? Our research has found otherwise: ESG has tended to perform very similarly and with very similar levels of risk to non-ESG approaches. What counts as ESG? As you may know, there is no single definition of ESG. For research purposes, we looked at mutual funds that Morningstar flags as \"Sustainable Investment – Overall\" as our ESG universe. This was a group of 222 unique funds across a range of categories, with most of the funds in U.S. Equity and International Equity asset classes. In this group, Morningstar includes funds with a variety of approaches, but excludes funds it sees as \"ESG Consideration\" only. This means that it aims to include only those funds for which ESG principles are an important part of the investment process, not funds that mention ESG issues in their paperwork but that don\\'t meaningfully rely on ESG. ESG funds have ranked near the middle of their peer groups One way to measure the performance of ESG funds is to see how their performance ranks relative to funds in the same Morningstar category. A fund that ranks in the 1st percentile for a three-year period has done better than all of the other funds like it over that time, while a fund that ranks in the 100th percentile has done the worst of all of its peers. If ESG funds were systematically at a disadvantage thanks to sticking to ESG principles, they would rank between the 50th and 100th percentiles time after time. ESG funds have consistently ranked around the middle of their peer groups Source: Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, Morningstar Direct as of 6/30/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Instead, what you can see from the chart above is that on an overall basis and across the three largest asset classes, ESG funds have consistently ranked around the middle of their peer groups—sometimes a bit below the middle, sometimes a bit above, but never dramatically worse. If ESG funds were at a natural disadvantage, these lines would be toward the bottom of the chart. If anything, ESG funds have done a bit better than average overall, especially recently (though this isn\\'t a strong effect). ESG funds have had about the same amount of risk as their peers When it comes to the risk of an investment portfolio like a mutual fund, one common measure is the standard deviation of returns. The higher the standard deviation, the bigger the swings the fund has experienced, both up and down. Stocks, for instance, tend to have much higher standard deviations than bonds. The table below shows standard deviations for ESG funds compared to their Morningstar category peers for the 10 categories that have the most ESG assets. Standard deviation of ESG funds relative to Morningstar category averages Note: Differences less than -0.5% are colored green. Differences greater than 0.5% are colored red. Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, Morningstar Direct as of 6/30/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The example is provided for illustrative purposes only. While there are a lot of numbers in the table above, the important numbers are the \"Difference\" rows in each section. If the difference is negative, it means the ESG funds in the category had a lower standard deviation—that is, less risk—than the peer group. A positive difference means that ESG funds were riskier than peers. If the difference is larger than half a percent, it is colored green (when ESG funds had lower risk) or red (when ESG funds had higher risk). There\\'s some red on the table (particularly in Mid Cap Growth and Large Value) and some green on the table (particularly in Mid Cap Blend), but overall little color, which means that over the past one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods, there wasn\\'t any strong evidence for ESG funds being riskier than other funds. Because environmental, social and governmental strategies exclude some securities, ESG-focused products may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as products that do not use such strategies. Additionally, the criteria used to select companies for investment may result in investing in securities, industries or sectors that underperform the market as a whole. ESG funds have performed fine during market drops Many investors care first and foremost about how a fund will do when times get hard and the market drops in value. So, how have ESG funds held up when stock markets have dropped in value? The table below shows the performance of ESG funds compared to their Morningstar category averages during the last six corrections (a drop of 10% in the stock market) and two bear markets (a drop of more than 20%). The most important rows here again are the differences, with green numbers showing times and categories where ESG funds held up better than their peers by at least half a percent, and red numbers showing where ESG funds held up worse by at least half a percent. Note: Differences greater than 0.5% are colored green. Differences less than -0.5% are colored red. Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, Morningstar Direct as of 6/30/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The example is provided for illustrative purposes only. The example does not assume that dividends and interest have been reinvested, and does not reflect the effects of taxes or fees. As with the risk table, you can once again see more green than red, indicating that ESG funds dropped less than their peers more frequently than they dropped farther. The two actual bear markets in the table—the first column, showing the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, and the last column, showing the 2008 great financial crisis—have only a single red number between them. This doesn\\'t mean that ESG protected investors from losses during market declines; in fact, ESG funds still fell substantially in value during those times. But they didn\\'t have any pattern of falling any more than other funds, and they often fell less. ESG funds have similarities to other funds While the results from these time periods have been generally encouraging for ESG funds as a whole, we don\\'t see convincing evidence that ESG funds are reliably better than non-ESG funds. The differences have tended to be small, and even when the differences have been good for ESG funds, there were always some individual funds that did worse. The important lesson here is that there is no evidence that choosing ESG funds puts investors at any kind of disadvantage when it comes to risk or returns. Bottom line: If the concept of socially responsible investing appeals to you, our research has found that you should not have to reduce your expectations when it comes to risk and return. ESG funds have done as well as other funds over time. However, there are many ESG options available and multiple ways to build an ESG portfolio. You should take into account your investment goals and risk tolerance before getting started in ESG investing.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'How to explore or get started with ESG, at your own pace.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Perhaps you\\'ve learned about Environmental, Social, and Governance investing (ESG) and have decided that you\\'d like to take advantage of this approach in your own portfolio, seeking to align your investments with your social or environmental goals instead of considering only risk and returns. Now the question becomes: How do you go about building an ESG portfolio? Do you have to change all of your investments, or can you tiptoe into ESG? We\\'re here to help. A spectrum of ESG portfolios You can think of your personal degree of ESG involvement within your investments on a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum, you might be \"all-out,\" and ESG doesn\\'t come into play at all. On the other end, you might be \"all-in,\" where ESG is completely embedded in every inch of your portfolio. And you might be somewhere in between. It\\'s okay to pick a point to start with and then move along that spectrum when you feel comfortable doing so. All-out: The lowest level of ESG involvement is what we call \"all-out.\" This is the default starting point for most of us, where our investment decisions are all about meeting financial goals, earning good returns, and controlling risk. Social and environmental factors might come into play in your charitable giving or volunteer activity, but not in your investments. This is okay! And it\\'s where investors typically begin. Exploring: At the \"exploring\" level, you might add an ESG fund to an otherwise non-ESG portfolio. You could for instance, sell a non-ESG fund in one part of your portfolio (for instance, a large-cap U.S. fund) and then buy an ESG fund in the same asset class. This way your overall portfolio is relatively unchanged, but you can have some exposure to investments that better align with your values. Middle-of-the-road: At the \"middle-of-the-road\" level, you can take ESG options where you can easily find them and stick with non-ESG options otherwise. For instance, you might have a well-diversified asset allocation plan in mind and use ESG funds to fill most of the broad equity slots (U.S. large cap and small cap, international developed markets). You might also use ESG funds for diversified fixed income or corporate bonds. For categories with few or no ESG options, a middle-of-the-road plan uses non-ESG funds, such as in real estate, emerging market bonds, government bonds, precious metals, etc. Focused: With a \"focused\" approach to ESG, you could specifically seek out investments across your entire portfolio that align with your ESG preferences. This can be done by picking off-the-shelf mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and/or separately managed accounts for all of the asset classes you want to invest in, or by hiring an advisor who specializes in building portfolios to align with your ESG preferences. All-in: The approach for an investor who is truly passionate about ESG is what we call \"all-in.\" With an all-in approach, you build an ESG portfolio from the ground up, researching your own underlying investments and putting them into a complete portfolio, security by security. While the all-in approach maximizes the alignment between the portfolio and your values, this approach can be time-consuming and difficult. ESG tools you can use Once you\\'ve decided where you want to be on the ESG portfolio spectrum, it\\'s time to pick your tools. Fortunately, you have some choices. Mutual funds: There are more than 300 mutual funds identified by Morningstar as \"Sustainable Investment – Overall,\" which aligns with how Schwab classifies ESG. Most of these funds are actively managed, but there are some index-tracking options. While there are ESG mutual funds in over 60 Morningstar categories, the largest number of options can be found (in descending order) in the U.S. equity, international equity, taxable bond and allocation asset classes. The ease of accessing these funds and their breadth across categories is a positive, but keep in mind that you can\\'t personalize a mutual fund—you own whichever securities the fund manager decides to own. And you usually can only get an update on the specific securities the fund owns once per quarter. Of course, there are also fees to consider, which can be as low as a tenth of one percent for some of the lowest-cost index funds to more than 2% in some instances.1 Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): There are more than 150 ESG ETFs based on the same \"Sustainable Investment – Overall\" data point from Morningstar, and unlike mutual funds, most of these are passively managed. These funds can be found in about 40 Morningstar categories, but the majority of funds are in the equity asset classes (U.S., international, and sector equity), with fewer options available in fixed income. Like mutual funds, ETFs do not provide you with flexibility to personally customize your portfolio. However, most ETFs provide daily disclosure of their holdings, so you can usually see exactly which securities are held by the ETF each day. Fees for ETFs are often lower than for mutual funds, since most ETFs track indexes; only two ESG ETFs have an expense ratio over 1%, and there are 100 such funds with expenses under half a percentage point.1 Separately managed accounts (SMAs): An SMA is a portfolio of individual securities managed on an investor\\'s behalf by a professional asset management firm. There are SMA managers who offer Environmental, Social, and Governance strategies. However, some SMAs can also provide investors with the option of customizing their portfolios. This can be helpful if you know exactly which stock (or group of stocks) you would like to exclude. Finding SMAs is not as simple as finding mutual funds or ETFs, and costs tend to be higher than for mutual funds and ETFs. Stock-by-stock or bond-by-bond research: If you want maximum control over your investments in order to align them to the highest degree with your ESG preferences, you can build a portfolio piece by piece by researching each security that you buy and evaluating its social and environmental quality. Obviously, this takes time and requires that you keep track of how the parts come together—are you too exposed or underexposed to any sectors, countries, or asset classes? But if you really want to know what you own, you can buy your stocks and bonds one by one. Putting it together ESG strategies can help you achieve goals beyond just investment returns. Schwab\\'s research has generally found that ESG funds as a whole have fairly similar risk and return characteristics as non-ESG funds. However, keep in mind that because ESG strategies exclude some securities, they may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as non-ESG funds. Additionally, the criteria used to select companies for investment may result in investing in securities, industries or sectors that underperform the market as a whole. If you\\'re ready to get started with an \"Exploring ESG\" portfolio, consider picking a single mutual fund or ETF whose investment objective sounds like it aligns with your values. To go deeper into a \"middle-of-the-road\" approach, you might choose several funds in different parts of your portfolio, looking beyond the investment objective and actually examining what the funds own. If you want to move into a \"focused\" or \"all-in\" ESG approach, you might want to seek out more customized help—a separately managed account that lets you specify what you want to avoid, or an advisor who specializes in a style of ESG that matches your values. But if you want the best possible match to your own preferences, you might just consider doing all your own research and buying only those stocks and bonds that fit your ESG desires. The choice is yours. 1 Morningstar Direct data as of 7/31/2021'},\n",

       "   'content': 'When you invest, are you simply trying to make as much money as possible without taking on too much risk? Or are you trying to accomplish other goals as well, perhaps making sure that your investments align with your values or that you\\'re using your money to help make a positive difference in the world? If those latter goals matter to you, you might be interested in Environmental, Social, and Governance investing, or ESG. ESG is the umbrella term Schwab uses to describe various investing approaches that emphasize social or environmental factors in addition to risk and return. You may see some other terms to describe some of these approaches, such as values-based, sustainable, socially conscious, Socially Responsible Investing (SRI), impact investing and others. When we talk about ESG, we\\'re talking about all of these. The history of ESG In the United States, the roots of ESG investing can be traced to the 18th century, when religious groups began forbidding investments in companies whose products or services had what they considered to be negative societal impacts. At the time, this meant avoiding investments in the slave trade, alcohol, gambling and tobacco. However, in the 1970s and \\'80s, activists adopted the same practice to shun companies profiting from the Vietnam War and to protest South African apartheid. Today, the practice of removing a single industry or group of industries from a portfolio is known as \"exclusionary screening.\" However, ESG has come to mean more than simply removing certain types of businesses from a portfolio based on political or religious values. Today, \"sustainable investing\" refers to assessing environmental, social, and governance risks to all the companies in a portfolio, and then determining how well each one is addressing the risks relevant to its business. This type of environmental, social, and governance integration received a jumpstart in 2004, when former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan wrote to the CEOs of major financial institutions, inviting them to participate in a joint initiative led by the UN Global Compact. The goal of the initiative was to find ways to integrate ESG considerations more broadly into capital markets. This initiative resulted in the launch of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) at the New York Stock Exchange in 2006. The PRI\\'s six principles are designed to encourage asset managers to think about ways socially responsible investing can become a bigger part of their daily investment activities. Basic ESG approaches Under the ESG umbrella, there are several different approaches that you can find via mutual funds and other investment vehicles. Values-based: The financial industry\\'s term Socially Responsible Investing (SRI), which we call values-based investing, usually means a specific investment approach that excludes certain sectors or certain types of companies, such as tobacco, firearms or fossil fuels companies. This approach often appeals most strongly to investors who care about avoiding having investment dollars in companies that some people consider to be objectionable. ESG integration: ESG integration refers to a more modern approach that started with large investors such as pension funds and endowments. The thesis behind ESG integration is that environmental, social and governance factors are important in determining the future risk and return of investments. ESG integration strategies are typically more similar to broad benchmarks than values-based strategies are, typically including some exposure to all economic sectors rather than completely excising certain sectors as unacceptable. It is common for ESG integration strategies to include exposure to potentially \"objectionable\" industries via stocks that are \"best-in-class\"—for instance, energy companies that are investing in non-fossil fuels in addition to their main line of business. That is, ESG integration strategies are more likely to include the \"less bad\" companies within various industries, thus keeping overall industry exposures in line with the broad market. The term \"integration\" is used to describe this approach, because it aims to integrate ESG factors that aren\\'t explicitly tied to risk and return with principles of good portfolio construction. Impact investing: This is a term that refers to explicitly deploying investment dollars in an effort to directly achieve some desired outcome. Examples include financing loans to low-income homebuyers, funding projects to reduce air pollution at factories, buying stock in a company in an effort to put positive shareholder initiatives on proxy ballots, etc. Impact investing is the closest type of investing to philanthropy. Impact investors are typically more concerned with changing the world or the companies they invest in. Why ESG? The appeal of Environmental, Social, and Governance investing is twofold. First, some investors hold their social responsibility and ethical values above pure financial profit motives and are willing to sacrifice (at least partially) profits for greater societal good. Second, there are profit-motivated investors, who expect that companies concerned about ESG responsibility will be better managed and potentially better at anticipating and mitigating risk. In their opinion, companies with strong ESG characteristics make for better long-term investments. Schwab\\'s research has generally found that ESG funds as a whole have fairly similar return and risk to regular non-ESG funds. However, because ESG strategies exclude some securities, ESG funds may not be able to take advantage of certain opportunities or market trends that other, non-ESG strategies can. While we don\\'t think investors should have to give up the prospect of earning good returns in order to invest in a socially responsible way, we also don\\'t see strong evidence for ESG being the path to greater returns or lower risk overall. If you decide to explore Environmental, Social, and Governance investing, it should be because you feel that it will help you achieve more of your goals, beyond just risk and return.'}],\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Make sure you understand the risks of short selling before taking the plunge.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Many successful traders profit from stocks that rise in value. But some do the opposite—profiting from stocks that decline in value—through a strategy known as short selling. Short selling involves borrowing a security whose price you think is going to fall from your brokerage and selling it on the open market. Your plan is to then buy the same stock back later, hopefully for a lower price than you initially sold it for, and pocket the difference after repaying the initial loan. For example, let\\'s say a stock is trading at $50 a share. You borrow 100 shares and sell them for $5,000. The price suddenly declines to $25 a share, at which point you purchase 100 shares to replace those you borrowed, netting $2,500. Short selling may sound straightforward, but this kind of speculative trading involves considerable risk. Here\\'s a closer look at how it works—and what to consider before taking the plunge. Getting started Because you\\'re borrowing shares from a brokerage firm, you must first establish a margin account to hold eligible bonds, cash, mutual funds, and/or stocks as collateral. As with other forms of borrowing, you\\'ll be charged interest on the value of the outstanding shares until they\\'re returned (though the interest may be tax-deductible). Interest rates can vary significantly—you may be able to short the most liquid shares for nothing, while the least liquid shares could come with an annualized interest rate of more than 100% of the value of your position—and even change suddenly if the shares become more or less liquid. Interest accrues daily at the prevailing rate and is deducted from your account on a monthly basis. (Also worth noting: Your brokerage will have to have a \"locate\" for the security you\\'re targeting before you can do a short sale. This is a regulatory requirement aimed at preventing \"naked shorting,\" which is when a trader attempts a short sale without actually taking delivery of the borrowed shares. The rule says your brokerage must have a reasonable belief the security can be borrowed and delivered on a specific date before you can short it. Shorting in such a situation could lead to your position being closed by your brokerage, potentially resulting in significant losses or costs.) Once you\\'ve opened and funded your margin account, you can start to research possible short-sale candidates. Traders typically use one or more of the following approaches to identify short-sale targets: Fundamental analysis: Analyzing a company\\'s financials can help you determine if its stock may be a candidate for a decline in price. For example, when looking for short-sale candidates, some traders look for companies with declining earnings per share (EPS) and sales growth in the expectation that the company\\'s share price will follow suit. Technical analysis: Patterns in a stock\\'s price movement can also help you determine if it\\'s on the cusp of a downtrend. One potential signal is when a stock has fallen through a series of lower lows while trading at higher volumes. Another could be when a stock rebounds to the upper range of its trading pattern but appears to be losing steam. Thematic: This approach involves betting against companies whose business models or technologies are deemed outdated (think Blockbuster Video), which can be more of a long game but can pay off should your prediction prove correct. Entering a trade As with any trade, you should identify your entry and exit points before you begin. You may also want to consider entering a stop order to help limit your losses in the event the trade moves against you. In general, two kinds of stop orders may prove useful: Buy-stop orders trigger a market order to buy back the shares at the next available price if the stock price rises to or above the stop price. Trailing buy-stops specify a stop price that follows, or \"trails,\" the lowest price of a stock by a percentage or dollar amount that you set. If the stock rises above its lowest price by the trail or more, it triggers a buy market order. If the price drops, the stop resets at a lower price. However, neither method guarantees that the order will execute at or near the \"stop\" price you designate, and in fact, the stop order could lock in significant losses if the price gaps up. Now for an example. Let\\'s say stock XYZ recently dropped from $90 per share to $66 before rebounding to $84, and you think it\\'s poised for another decline. After researching company fundamentals and analyzing recent price movements, you might decide on the following trade plan: Enter a short position only if the stock falls below $80 per share. Set your buy-stop order at $84 in the hope of limiting a potential loss to $4 per share. Close out your position at or below $74 per share. Source: Schwab.com. This example is hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. Understanding the risks Short selling comes with numerous risks: 1. Potentially limitless losses: When you buy shares of stock (take a long position), your downside is limited to 100% of the money you invested. But when you short a stock, its price can keep rising. In theory, that means there\\'s no upper limit to the amount you\\'d have to pay to replace the borrowed shares. For example, you enter a short position on 100 shares of stock XYZ at $80, but instead of falling, the stock rises to $100. You\\'ll have to spend $10,000 to pay back your borrowed shares—at a loss of $2,000. Stop orders can help mitigate this risk, but they\\'re by no means bulletproof. Losses for short-sellers can be particularly heavy during a so-called short-squeeze, which can occur when a heavily shorted stock unexpectedly rises in value, triggering a cascade of further price increases as more and more short-sellers are forced to buy the stock to close out their positions. Each wave of purchases causes the stock\\'s price to surge higher, hurting anyone holding onto a short position. 2. A sudden change in fees. As noted above, the cost to borrow a stock changes frequently in response to supply and demand conditions. For example, you could log off one night with a short position carrying a 20% interest rate, only to log in the next day to find it has surged to 85%. As a result, you may find it no longer makes sense to keep your position open. Even worse would be a case where both the value of the stock you\\'ve shorted and the accompanying interest rate are rising at the same time, sending your cost to carry skyward. (Schwab clients with StreetSmart Edge® can see both borrowing rates and availability for particular shares by adding them to their watch lists. Just click on the \"Actions\" drop-down menu and click \"Columns & Settings.\" Under \"Company Info\" check the \"Short Sell Borrowing Rate\" and \"Short Sell Availability\" boxes.) 3. Dividend Payments. Short sellers aren\\'t entitled to dividend payments from the shares they\\'ve borrowed. In fact, the value of any dividends paid will be deducted from short-seller\\'s account on the pay date and delivered to the stock\\'s owner. Some short sellers choose to close their short positions before the stock\\'s ex-dividend date to avoid having to pay. (As a reminder, the ex-dividend date is the first day a stock\\'s price no longer includes the value of a declared dividend. That\\'s because the value of the next dividend payment is owed to the stock\\'s owner.) 4. Margin calls. If the value of the collateral in your margin account drops below the minimum equity requirement—usually 30% to 35% of the value of the borrowed shares, depending on the firm and the particular securities you own—your brokerage may require you to deposit more cash or securities to cover the shortfall immediately. For example, as long as your 100 shares of stock XYZ remain at $80 per share, you\\'ll need $2,400 in your margin account—assuming a 30% equity requirement ($8,000 x .30). However, if the stock suddenly rises to $100 per share, you\\'ll need $3,000 ($10,000 x .30)—requiring an immediate infusion of $600 to your account, which you may or may not have. If you fail to meet the margin call, your brokerage firm may close out open positions to bring your account back to the minimum requirement. Proceed with caution At its most basic, short selling involves rooting against individual companies or the market, and some investors may be opposed to that on principle. However, if you have a firm conviction that a stock price is heading lower, then shorting can be a profitable way to act on that instinct—so long as you\\'re aware of the risks.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'For 2021, will you have to pay alternative minimum tax? Here’s what you should know about the AMT and the steps you can take to potentially avoid it.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Nobody enjoys paying taxes, but if you had to pick one tax that is almost universally disliked, it\\'s the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Fortunately, recent tax-law changes have kept more taxpayers from falling into AMT territory—but those changes could revert in a few years. In the meantime, it\\'s still useful to know how the alternative minimum tax is calculated and how it could affect you. What is the alternative minimum tax? The easiest way to understand the AMT is to envision it as a tax floor. Once your tax rate drops to that floor, the AMT won\\'t allow it to go any lower. Originally, the AMT was intended to crack down on wealthy people who weren\\'t paying any income taxes. Gradually, as inflation caused incomes to rise, the middle class started to get hit with this tax. When Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017, the AMT rules significantly changed. However, the changes are temporary and apply only to tax years 2018 to 2025 unless Congress extends them or makes them permanent. How does the alternative minimum tax work? Let\\'s look at a simple example. Start by calculating your ordinary taxable income using IRS Form 1040. Then, on IRS Form 6251, add back some types of income and drop certain deductions. Be sure to include income that might be tax-free under the normal income tax system but not under the AMT. One example is interest from private-activity municipal bonds, which fund private company projects that benefit the public (like airports). Next, remove certain tax breaks, such as your deductions for state, local, and property taxes. Then, subtract your AMT exemption (if eligible), which for the 2022 tax year is $75,900 for individuals, $59,050 for married couples filing separately, and $118,100 for married couples filing jointly or qualifying widow(er). Finally, compute the AMT on what\\'s left, compare that amount with what you would owe under the regular system, and pay the higher of the two. What are the chances the alternative minimum tax will affect you? Prior to the passage of the TCJA (tax years 2017 or earlier), if your household income was over $200,000 per year, you had about a 56% chance that the AMT would show up on your tax return.¹ With those odds, many people were rightfully concerned about the AMT affecting them. Today, your odds of encountering the AMT are much lower, primarily because of two significant changes within the TCJA: an increase in the AMT exemptions and an increase in the phase-out thresholds. The chart below compares the prior AMT exemption to the current exemption under the TCJA. AMT exemptions Source: IRS Along with the increased exemption, the point at which the exemption begins to phase out has been significantly increased. AMT exemption phase-out thresholds Source: IRS Once your income for the AMT hits the phase-out threshold, your AMT exemption begins to phase out at 25 cents for every dollar over the threshold. In the past, the phase-out level was quite low, and many households that wouldn\\'t consider themselves to be wealthy were getting affected by the AMT. What triggers the alternative minimum tax for tax years 2018 to 2025? These are some of the most likely situations: Having a high household income. If your household income is over the phase-out thresholds ($1,079,800 for married filing jointly and $539,900 for everyone else), and you have a significant amount of itemized deductions, the AMT could still affect you. Realizing a large capital gain. Long-term gains (e.g., profits from selling a home or other investments) are taxed at the same rate under both systems, but capital gains could put you over the AMT exemption threshold. That could cause the AMT to kick in, which means you may not be able to deduct state income taxes you paid. Exercising stock options. Normally, exercising qualified employee stock options (also called incentive stock options or ISOs) to buy stock at a discounted price isn\\'t a taxable event until you sell the shares for a profit. The AMT, however, creates a paper profit that\\'s taxable even though you won\\'t receive the actual profit until you sell the shares. If you\\'re close to the AMT thresholds, you can use IRS Form 6251 to see if you\\'re at risk. You can also run your own projections using tax preparation software or hire a tax professional to calculate it for you. Depending on your income and deductions, you could find yourself affected by the AMT in one tax year but not the next. If you\\'re close to the AMT threshold, doing a multiyear projection is good practice to see which tax years pose the most risk for you and how you might mitigate that risk. For example, you could accelerate or delay certain transactions, such as selling an asset with a large gain, to minimize triggering the AMT. Getting hit with the AMT is unfortunate, but it\\'s not a reason to change your life goals. The AMT is just something to be aware of during your financial planning process—it shouldn\\'t keep you up at night. ¹Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research, based on information in the IRS publication \"Statistics of Income–2014 Individual Income Tax Returns Complete Report\" (Publication 1304), Table 1.4.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are similar to mutual funds except that they trade intraday like stocks. Even though ETFs can be relatively inexpensive, investing in them does include certain costs. The most obvious is the operating expense ratio (OER), which is incurred while owning the ETF. However, trading costs are also important: commissions (if applicable), bid/ask spreads, and changes in discounts and premiums to an ETF\\'s net asset value (NAV) will impact the total cost of ownership. Operating expenses ETFs are popular with investors for a number of reasons, but investors often find the lower operating expenses most appealing. Most ETFs have attractively low expenses compared to actively managed mutual funds and, to a lesser extent, passively managed index mutual funds. ETF expenses are usually stated in terms of a fund\\'s operating expense ratio (OER). The expense ratio is an annual rate the fund (not your broker) charges on the total assets it holds to pay for portfolio management, administration, and other costs. As an ongoing expense, the OER is relevant for all investors but particularly for long-term, buy-and-hold investors. When choosing between two or more ETFs that track the same market index (or similar indexes), be sure to compare their expense ratios among other factors. Several ETF issuers have recently launched lower OER versions of their most popular funds. A little homework might pay off. Commission costs Unlike other investments, many investors can trade listed ETFs online commission-free, including at Schwab.1 Thus, commission costs aren\\'t as important of a consideration as they have been in the past. However, you\\'ll still want to check with your broker for commission costs, which can range from $0 to $25 or more (fees are often higher if you place a trade in person or over the phone). In cases where you pay commissions to trade ETFs, keep these two points in mind: The more frequently you trade, the more you\\'ll pay in total commissions. Because commissions are typically a flat fee no matter how large or small the trade, the percentage cost per trade will be larger for smaller trades and smaller for larger trades. For example, a $5 commission on a $500 trade represents a somewhat large 1% fee, whereas the same commission paid on a $5,000 trade represents a 0.1% fee Bid/ask spreads While commissions and expense ratios are straightforward, ETF investors often overlook a third cost: the bid/ask spread. The \"ask\" (or \"offer\") is the market price at which an ETF can be bought, and the \"bid\" is the market price at which the same ETF can be sold. The difference between these two prices is commonly known as the bid/ask spread. You can think of the bid/ask spread as a transaction cost similar to commissions except that the spread is built into the market price and is paid on each roundtrip purchase and sale. So, the larger the spread and the more frequently you trade, the more relevant this cost becomes. The three main factors that drive bid/ask spreads include: The extent of market maker competition The liquidity of the underlying assets in the ETF Market maker inventory management costs Comparing bid/ask spread and expense ratio for two ETFs Comparing bid/ask spread and expense ratio for two ETFs Let’s compare costs for two hypothetical ETFs assuming a $10,000 purchase. Comparing bid/ask spread and expense ratio for two hypothetical ETFs assuming a $10,000 purchase Costs ETF A ETF B Commission (online trades only) $0 $0 Expense ratio 0.20% ($20) 0.15% ($15) Bid/ask spread 0.004% ($0.40) 0.11% ($11) Total cost (roundtrip cost after one year) 0.204% ($20.40) 0.26% ($26) Source Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, Inc. This example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. At first glance, it would appear that ETF B is less expensive because of its lower expense ratio. After closer examination of the bid/ask spreads, however, you learn that ETF B has a much larger spread than ETF A. This tells you that in a roundtrip trade, you\\'re estimated to lose more of your investment in ETF B than ETF A because of the difference in spreads. Despite its higher expense ratio, ETF A looks to have a lower cost assuming you hold each ETF for one year, you pay zero commissions, and all other costs remain constant. Furthermore, the 0.004% spread of ETF A also indicates that it likely has a higher trade volume than ETF B, which might make ETF A preferable for liquidity reasons as well. Discounts and premiums to NAV The last (and possibly least understood) potential cost comes from changes in discounts and premiums to NAV during the period you hold an ETF. This potential cost differs from the others because it can be a positive factor on overall returns—for example, it might increase your return instead of decreasing it. An ETF is said to be trading at a premium when its market price is higher than its NAV—simply stated, you\\'re paying a bit more for the ETF than its holdings are actually worth. An ETF is said to be trading at a discount when its market price is lower than its NAV—that is, you\\'re buying the ETF for less than the value of its holdings. For example, imagine an ETF that trades in the market at $30 per share. If the individual stocks the ETF holds are worth only $29.90 per fund share, then the ETF is trading at a premium of 0.33%. Conversely, if the stocks the ETF holds are worth $30.25 per fund share, the ETF is trading at a discount of 0.83%. In general, most ETFs exhibit small discounts and premiums. When material differences do manifest in ETF prices, large institutional investors (called authorized participants) usually help the market self-correct by attempting to profit from arbitrage trades that serve to better align an ETF\\'s market price and NAV. To illustrate this point, let\\'s assume that an ETF is trading at a premium of 1% to NAV. An authorized participant might attempt to capture that premium by simultaneously purchasing a basket of the underlying securities the ETF tracks, exchanging the basket of securities for shares of the ETF, and selling the shares in the open market. This process of exchanging baskets of the securities in an index for shares of the ETF is called the in-kind creation/redemption mechanism, and it\\'s the reason ETF premiums and discounts are generally self-correcting. Deviations from NAV create profit opportunities for authorized participants. As they conduct arbitrage trades, they help bring the ETF\\'s market price into better alignment with its NAV. In the case of an ETF that trades at a premium, for example, authorized participants selling newly created ETF shares increase the supply in the market, which helps drive down the price of the ETF closer to its NAV. When the securities that make up the index an ETF tracks are easily priced because many buy and sell orders are being placed in a centralized exchange, \"creating\" a basket of securities to replicate the index is relatively straightforward. As a result, ETFs that track heavily traded, highly liquid markets—like U.S. stocks—typically display only small premiums or discounts. A good example of this is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500® and whose market price might not stray more than 0.20% or so away from its NAV. However, ETFs that track less liquid markets—such as high-yield bonds, commodities, or emerging markets—can display differences of 1% or more, usually due to lack of liquidity but sometimes because of more complex factors. You can tell if an ETF is trading at a premium or discount by checking its performance using Schwab\\'s ETF quotes and research tool, where you can find the premium or discount as a percentage of NAV for the previous day\\'s close. Remember, the change in discount or premium is what matters most. Moreover, these changes aren\\'t always necessarily a drag on performance—the effect can be either positive or negative depending on which way the discount or premium moves between a purchase and subsequent sale. For example, if an international fixed-income ETF trades with a somewhat persistent 0.6% premium to NAV, and you bought and sold the ETF at that same premium, your return wouldn\\'t be affected. The risk comes when that premium erodes or even becomes a discount during the time you own it. In our example, if you bought the ETF while it was trading at a 0.6% premium but sold it while it was trading at a 0.4% discount, the change during the roundtrip would\\'ve cost you 1%. Although realizing small gains or losses from potential changes in discounts and premiums might be acceptable in many cases, and possibly even unavoidable for certain ETFs, the main point is to be aware of the risks involved—and to be purposeful when trading ETFs that may exhibit excessively large or volatile discounts and premiums to NAV. Investors should also be aware that some investment products (such as exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and closed-end funds) also trade intraday like stocks and ETFs. However, because these products lack the complete in-kind creation and redemption process used by ETFs, discounts and premiums may be more problematic. Portfolio strategy: long term vs. active trading Your portfolio strategy greatly influences the net effect of commissions, operating expenses, bid/ask spreads, and potential changes in premiums and discounts to NAV. In the table below, we estimate the hypothetical cost of ownership for a long-term, buy-and-hold investor and an active investor who both invest in the same ETF. Total estimated ETF costs during one year Total estimated ETF costs during one year The hypothetical cost of ownership for a long-term, buy-and-hold investor and an active investor who both invest in the same ETF Description of costs and assumptions Long-term, buy-and-hold investor Active investor Average trades per year ($10,000 per trade) 2 (1 roundtrip) 60 (30 roundtrips) Commissions (online trades only) $0 $0 Bid/ask spreads (0.15% average per roundtrip) $15 $450 Operating expenses (0.18% per year on $10,000 balance) $18 (ETF held every day in the year) $9 (ETF held for half of the days in the year) Changes in discounts/premiums $0 $0 Total $33 $459 Source Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, Inc. This example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. The more you trade, the more important commissions and bid/ask spreads become because you pay for each during every roundtrip made. On the other hand, the longer you hold an ETF position, the more important the expense ratio becomes because it\\'s a recurring management fee paid to the fund for as long as you own the ETF. Discounts and premiums to NAV can either drag or boost performance depending on how they move during the time you hold the ETF. In conclusion, investors should remember that an ETF\\'s total cost of ownership is a combination of its operating expenses and costs of trading. Your investing strategy as well as the specific ETFs that you select for your portfolio can make a big difference in the total cost.2 1Standard online $0 commission does not apply to over-the-counter (OTC) equities, transaction-fee mutual funds, futures, fixed-income investments, or trades placed directly on a foreign exchange or in the Canadian market.

       "   'abstract': 'A custodial IRA can be a great way to teach a teen to save for the future—and manage money wisely in the present.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My 17-year-old daughter has saved $2,000 in income this year from walking dogs and babysitting. Can I open a custodial Roth IRA for her? Should I? —A Reader Dear Reader, Your daughter is lucky to have a parent who\\'s helping her think ahead. Getting kids to start saving early—even for retirement—is one of my personal passions. In fact, as soon as my kids started to have earned income, I helped them open custodial Roth IRAs. And now they\\'re all savers and investors. I believe that a custodial IRA can be a great way to introduce a young person to the idea of investing for the long term. Especially these days, with the profusion of online trading platforms that make investing seem like a video game (or even worse—gambling), I like the fact that a custodial account lets you be in the driver\\'s seat for a while to help your teen learn some solid basics before they\\'re on their own. So yes, the short answer is that you can open a Roth IRA for your daughter with her earnings. Whether you should or not depends on her circumstances. But if you do decide on a Roth, don\\'t just open the account; use it as an opportunity to open doors. Here\\'s how. First, select the correct account Just for the record, a custodial account is a bank or brokerage account that an adult (typically a parent) holds for a minor. Although all funds are owned by the minor, the assets are managed by the custodian until the minor reaches the age of majority—at which point the young adult takes complete control. And while you could also consider a regular custodial brokerage account or a custodial traditional IRA, to me a Roth IRA can make sense for a lot of reasons. At your daughter\\'s age and income (in general, you can only deposit earned income into a retirement account), she doesn\\'t likely need the upfront tax deduction of a traditional IRA. And chances are she\\'ll be in a much higher tax-bracket down the road and will appreciate the potential for tax-free withdrawals of a Roth come retirement. Another plus is that the assets in a traditional or Roth IRA, unlike those in a custodial brokerage account, won\\'t impact her chances for financial aid. Make it part of a bigger financial lesson Saving for retirement is an important lesson, but it\\'s part of a bigger financial picture. This would be a great time to take a step back and talk about goals, both short and long term. What else is your daughter saving for? Maybe some of her earnings could be put toward a shorter-term goal that she can achieve more quickly. Or she could put a portion of her earnings toward college. Make it real by having her write down her goals, and put a dollar amount and a timeline against each one. Make sure your discussion of goals and savings includes the importance of having an emergency fund. This will help her—and you—since she won\\'t have to rely solely on \"the bank of mom and dad.\" It will also mean she\\'ll more likely be able to leave her retirement fund intact should something unexpected come up. Also help her create a monthly budget so she can stay on top of her expenses and carve out money for savings each month. If she doesn\\'t have checking and savings accounts, consider opening those as well. It\\'s all part of helping her become financially fit so she can manage her money wisely for the present as well as the future. Involve your daughter in the account opening process It\\'s easy to download and complete an application. But before you do, talk to your daughter about what a custodial Roth IRA is, why it\\'s important for her to save for the future, and how the two of you can work together to manage her money. If she balks at the idea of saving for something such a long way off, make sure she understands that, while the goal is to keep her money growing for the future, one of the advantages of a Roth is that contributions can be withdrawn at any time without tax penalties if she’s in a pinch. Additionally, while a Roth is designed to be a retirement account, the money could be used for her education or even to buy a first home. Then complete the application together. Consider making an appointment for the two of you with a financial advisor where you\\'re opening the account. Making the experience personal will make it more meaningful, and will help your daughter see that this is about her money and her future. Introduce investing Once the Roth IRA is open and funded, don\\'t stop there. Help your daughter begin to invest by discussing principles such as diversification, not timing the market, not panicking when things go down, and investing for the long haul. A broad-based stock mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a good way for a new investor to get get started. Do some online research together so she can see the types of funds there are, how she can choose investments that align with her feelings about risk, time horizon—even her values. You could help her invest in companies she\\'s interested in by introducing her to fractional shares. Also share your own investment experiences—both good and bad. Add some personal motivation Helping your daughter open a custodial Roth with her current earnings is a great first step. If she continues to have earned income, encourage her to keep saving in her IRA each year. As a motivation, you might offer to match her contributions in some way. Just be aware that while the annual IRA contribution limit for 2021/2022 is $6,000 if you’re under age 50, to make a contribution, you have to have earned income to match. So for instance, if your daughter decided to contribute $1,500 of her $2,000 in earnings this year and put $500 toward another goal, you could offer to put $500 of your own money in her IRA to bring her contribution up to her total earnings. Prepare her to take charge In the not-too-distant future—typically at 18 or 21 depending on the state you live in—she’ll be completely in the driver’s seat and have full control over any money in a custodial account. By teaching her good money management skills now, you\\'ll be helping her learn to use that money wisely. Perhaps even more importantly, you\\'ll be helping her become financially independent and better prepared to take advantage of the many opportunities ahead. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'What will your retirement look like? Will you travel? Go back to school? Or just work less and enjoy life more? Here are three scenarios to help you turn your vision into reality.',\n",
       "   'content': 'It might seem like a long way off, but the day may come when you’ll want to work less or not at all. It’s never too early to start thinking about how you’d like your retirement to look. And the more details you can fill into that picture, the better your chance of saving enough to turn it into reality. You can use a retirement calculator to estimate your savings goal. But first, you’ll need a good idea of the retirement you want and how much it’s likely to cost. Here are three common scenarios to consider. Scenario 1: Scaling back Many people see themselves living more simply and spending less in retirement. In some cases, a smaller nest egg can work. But living comfortably on less money takes planning. And your expenses might not drop as much as you think. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, housing is likely the largest expense you’ll face in retirement, so reducing those costs can have the biggest impact on your budget. Relocating to a less expensive area or downsizing could help greatly with this. If you want to stay put, planning to pay off your mortgage before you retire is another way to reduce monthly expenses. You could also look to spend less on transportation, the second-highest cost for most retirees. For example, if you live close to amenities or public transportation, you might be able to forego owning a car altogether. Health care is another essential expense to plan for. Costs can vary greatly from person to person. But setting aside money in a tax-advantaged health savings account (HSA)1 and living a healthy lifestyle may help you save on medical care. Scenario 2: Changing things up Maybe you want to try something new in retirement, like going back to school or pursuing a passion. Or maybe you just want to relax more without giving up your career completely. The choice is yours, as long as you budget for it. If your plan is to further your education, you’ll want to account for tuition along with your living expenses. But you might not need as much as you think—many colleges offer free or reduced tuition programs for retirees. And what you learn could lead to a second career and additional income. Many retirees choose to keep working in retirement, whether in their current field or a new one. You could work fewer hours for your employer, turn a hobby into a business, or take a part-time job doing something you love. Besides income and possible medical benefits, working can provide social connections and a sense of purpose. Volunteering for a charity in retirement could be similarly rewarding. You won’t earn a salary but you might get other perks, like discounts or access to social and cultural events. Scenario 3: Living large Many retirees not only seek a complete break from work, but also want to do all the things they put off while they were working. Traveling is a big one, whether it’s to see the world or far-flung relatives. The key is to go big with your planning, and get as specific as possible about your goals. How many trips do you see yourself taking? Where would you like to go? How would you like to travel? Once you have an idea, add up the potential costs. Including them in your retirement savings plan now can increase the odds that your retirement budget will match your wanderlust when the time comes. Start envisioning today Your retirement is full of possibilities. You can take charge of them now by taking time to ask yourself some important questions: How much do I see my life changing in retirement? What do I want to do? How much is my lifestyle likely to cost each month? Will I stay where I am or live somewhere else? What expenses should I plan for, given my retirement needs and goals? The sooner you know the answers, the sooner you’ll know what you need to do to make the retirement you want a reality. 1You must be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) to be eligible for a health savings account (HSA).'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'We believe it can, at least in the short term.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Investors holding foreign assets with exposure to the U.S. dollar have had a volatile ride year to date: up in Q1, down in Q2, and back up in Q3. Now that the dollar is near the year\\'s highs, can the rally continue? We believe it can in the near term, although our longer-term view is more nuanced. Here\\'s what we see ahead. Multiple factors support dollar strength in the near term Although the dollar is near its year-to-date high, it is likely to get support over the next year from relatively high U.S. interest rates--at least, compared with those of other major developed countries--expectations for tighter Federal Reserve policy, and the slowing in global growth. The dollar is just below this year\\'s high Source: Bloomberg. Shows U.S. Federal Reserve Trade-Weighted Nominal Dollar Index (USTWBGD Index), a measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other global currencies. Daily data as of 8/27/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 1. U.S. interest rates are high relative to global rates So far during 2021, the dollar\\'s strength has been driven largely by the rise in U.S. interest rates relative to those in other major developed countries. Although U.S. yields are low in real terms—that is, adjusted for inflation—that hasn\\'t been enough to push the dollar lower. It appears that the market is viewing the recent inflation spike as transitory. Moreover, in the yield-starved world of government bonds, even the paltry yields on U.S. Treasuries look attractive. U.S. yields are above other major developed-country yields Source: Bloomberg. Data as of 8/26/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. We compared the 10-year U.S. government bond yield to the average 10-year government bond yield in major developed markets. Barring dollar liquidity crises, the interest rate differential has had a strong relationship with the direction of the dollar--typically rising and falling in tandem. The interest rate differential is currently providing support for a stronger dollar, as it is above 1% and increasing.

Global central bank policies should support the dollar The dollar moved higher over the summer as markets expected the Fed to begin tapering its asset purchases in the months ahead. In a speech at the Fed\\'s annual Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in August, Fed Chair Jerome Powell prepped the markets for a tapering announcement later this year--but the dollar dropped on indications that Fed rate hikes might not follow the end of its quantitative-easing program as quickly as expected. However, with the Fed\\'s policy rate higher than the currently negative policy rates of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the European Central Bank (ECB), support for the dollar should remain intact for the near term. The bottom line: Once tapering is complete in 2022, as is currently expected, the Fed will have more flexibility to raise short-term rates based on the outlook for inflation and the labor market. By comparison, other major central banks appear likely to maintain easy policies. The Fed\\'s policy rate is above those of other major central banks Source: Bloomberg. Data reflects the Fed\\'s federal funds rate upper target, the BOE official bank rate, the BOJ policy rate balance rate, and the ECB deposit facility announcement rate. Data as of 8/30/2021. 3. Declining global growth prospects may weigh on emerging-market (EM) currencies The dollar has moved up relative to EM currencies on signs that the pace of global growth is slowing. China\\'s regulatory and credit policies have rippled through Asian EM countries. The decline in credit growth and increased regulatory control of some industries have led to slower economic growth and contributed to a drop in commodity prices. China\\'s credit impulse tracks the growth rate of credit in China--as of July, the year-over-year growth rate in credit was -5.29%. The decline is likely to weigh on the Chinese yuan (CNY) relative to the U.S. dollar. China\\'s new-credit growth rate has slowed Source: Bloomberg, Bloomberg Economics China Credit Impulse 12-Month Net Change (CHBGREVA Index). The credit impulse is the change in new credit issued as a proportion of gross domestic product. Monthly data as of July 2021. Given that China is a top trading partner of the U.S., it is the second-highest currency weight in the Fed\\'s trade-weighted dollar index. This means a weaker CNY translates to a stronger trade-weighted dollar. China is the second-largest weight in the Fed trade-weighted dollar index Source: Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve\\'s Broad Trade-Weighted Dollar. Data as of 2021. The decline in China\\'s growth also affects emerging-market economies that export commodities to China. Lower commodity purchases translate to lower commodity prices, keeping emerging-market currencies down and the U.S. dollar up. Over the longer term, the dollar faces some risk Looking out two to five years, we are less positive. The large budget and current account--or trade--deficits and the prospects for a broader global recovery should put downward pressure on the dollar over the long run. Widening current account deficits tend to lead to a weaker dollar in the long run Source: Bloomberg. Federal Reserve trade-weighted dollar index and the U.S. current account balance as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) (USTWBGD Index, EHCAUS Index). Quarterly data as of March 2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. We will be watching yields and portfolio flows for signs that investors are shifting away from dollar-denominated assets in favor of other currencies. If this occurs, the decline in the dollar would provide a boost to international investments. When that time comes, we will change our view accordingly. In the meantime, the dollar is likely to head higher. What to consider now We expect the dollar to strengthen moderately over the coming months. A stronger dollar is generally negative for commodity prices and reduces returns on international investments. We are maintaining a neutral view for emerging-market and global (non-USD-denominated) bonds. Whenever yields are at such low, if not negative, levels in the global bond market, performance of the broader index tends to track more closely to the movement in the dollar. The stronger dollar year to date has weighed on the global bond market. The stronger dollar has led to lackluster returns for global bonds Source: Bloomberg. Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate ex-USD Bond Index (LG38TRUU Index). Daily data as of 8/27/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. To be clear, our neutral outlook for international fixed income is not an underweight--it is still important to have exposure to international fixed income to provide diversification to a bond portfolio. We also suggest: Maintain a below-benchmark duration in global bonds (ex-U.S.). It is crucial to keep in mind that the duration, or price sensitivity to rate changes, of global bonds is higher than the broad U.S. aggregate bond index. Be cautious about how much duration is added to the portfolio from the global bond holdings. Look for opportunities to rebalance to the target weight for international fixed income. It is likely that international bonds haven\\'t kept pace with other fixed income investments this year, leading investors to be underweight. Try to pick up international fixed income bonds at a cheaper price when the spreads over Treasuries rise. Keep expectations in check. The main reason for maintaining a neutral weight to international fixed income is to keep a more diversified bond portfolio and prevent timing the market. As such, international fixed income is unlikely to be the \"breadwinner\" for your portfolio anytime soon.

       "   'content': 'When it comes to saving for retirement, the clock is ticking. To illustrate the value of time, let\\'s consider three Roth IRA investors. Kate, Derek, and Jane all decide to open Roth IRAs to supplement their other retirement accounts. Each investor hopes to build this account to $500,000 at the time of retirement, though they are starting to save for retirement at different ages. All plan to retire at age 65, and the investors make the maximum allowed contribution each year. *People age 50 and older are allowed to include a $1,000 \"catch-up\" contribution. By age 65, here\\'s how their savings could add up The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to represent a specific investment product. Assumes annual contribution of $6,000 until age 50, and $7,000 from age 50 to age 65; also assumes 6% average annual portfolio growth. Values are rounded. How you can best prepare for the future Here\\'s a retirement savings rule of thumb to get you started. If you start saving in your 20s, contributing 15%–20% of your paycheck (including any savings match from your employer) you will likely meet your retirement savings goal. With every decade you delay, however, you\\'ll need to save a larger percentage of your paycheck. Find additional ways to save Here are some options for getting on the right track: Maximize your workplace retirement plan. For 2022, the maximum 401(k) contribution for employees under age 50 is $20,500. Employees age 50 or over can make an additional catch-up contribution of $6,500. Be sure to take advantage of any match your company offers. Devote funds from a windfall, such as a bonus or inheritance, to an investment account geared toward your retirement. Set up a taxable brokerage account to supplement your retirement savings. Give your savings a boost. As your income increases, up your savings rate by 1%–3% each year. Before you know it, you\\'ll be savings a lot more than you thought you could. Start a Health Savings Account (HSA)—if you\\'re able—to help cover medical expenses, both now and later in life.1 If you don’t use the money, you won\\'t lose it. An HSA stays with you. Better late than never Invest in your future sooner rather than later. If you\\'re starting later in life, don\\'t get discouraged—there are other options that could help you reach your financial goals. All it takes is discipline and perseverance. 1 You may only open and contribute to an HSA if you\\'re covered by a high deductible health plan. Contribution limits for 2022 are up to $3,650 for single coverage and $7,300 for family. In 2023, limits will increase to $3,850 for self-coverage and $7,750 for family.

       "   'abstract': \"If you're contemplating a major career change, here are five things to do first.\",\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, As we head into year three of the pandemic, I’ve been hearing from a lot of you about job burnout, the desire to create better work-life balance, and revised career goals. That doesn't surprise me given the events and uncertainty of the last several months. And it fits right in with what's happening nationally, even globally. But while I certainly understand the desire to do something that reflects your personal passions and values, I can't help but remind everyone to carefully consider the financial implications. Here's a little perspective. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of Americans quitting their jobs is at an all-time high. And recent research by Microsoft estimates more than 40 percent of the global workforce is contemplating a job change or a complete career shift. The reasons might be money or flexibility or opportunity, but in general it seems people are reprioritizing. For instance, the 2021 Schwab Modern Wealth Survey finds there's now an increased concern for mental health and relationships as well as financial security. All this can be seen as positive. Especially when you combine these statistics with the fact that as folks stayed home and spent less during the pandemic, personal savings rates for many households went up—along with the stock market reaching new highs. At the same time, many people used savings to pay down debt. Which means more people are feeling like they have the financial ability to look for work that's a better fit or more meaningful. The concerning part is that any job or career shift can significantly impact your financial future. To me, it's essential to carefully think through the financial pluses and minuses in advance. So to help you prepare financially, here's a checklist of five things to do before you make a move. 1) Thoughtfully research where you want to go—and why It's one thing to be dissatisfied or want to make a change; it's another to know what will make you happier. Maybe you want to be more independent, or have more time with the kids, or you're just tired of the commute. What type of job would get you where you want to go? Do you want to start your own business? Become a teacher? Get into high tech? Thoughtfully look at your natural talents, current skills, and temperament. Dig into the details of any new position. Transitioning to a new job or career takes more than money. It takes an investment of time and energy and commitment. Know what you're getting into. 2) Make sure your family understands what it means financially for them Finding a new job may be personal, but if you have a spouse, partner or family, they also have to be part of the decision. It's important that all of you understand both the short- and long-term financial implications. How will this affect your daily spending? Your long-term goals like retirement or a child's education? Can your spouse or partner pick up the slack during this transition? If you have older kids, will they understand they too may have to give up some things or chip in more for things they want? Talk openly and honestly about the pluses and minuses of making a change and how it will impact your family finances. 3) Consider the benefits and perks you're leaving behind Making a change always involves a certain number of tradeoffs. Depending on the position you're leaving, they could be significant. Employee benefits can encompass everything from health insurance and matching retirement contributions to paid time off and childcare subsidies. And don't forget about things like stock options and restricted stocks. You may be walking away from good money! Can you negotiate additional cash compensation if your next job doesn’t have them? It's easy to take such perks for granted—until you don't have them. 4) Do some upfront planning If you're looking for a new job in your current field, making a change may be pretty straightforward. But if you want to do something completely different like open a café, get a teaching certificate or go to a computer programming boot camp, it's going to take time and money—and upfront planning. What kind of new training will you need, and how long it will take? What's the competition for your new business and how much capital do you need to get started? Are there local job opportunities in the field you're considering or will you have to relocate? Best to map things out in advance. 5) Clear the financial obstacles You may be emotionally ready to make your move, but be sure to give yourself a smooth financial path before you do. Here's what I recommend: Shore up your savings—Building your emergency fund is key. I usually suggest having enough cash to cover 3 to 6 months essential expenses. When making a job change, more is better. The bigger your savings, the longer the time you'll have to pursue your new goal. Pay down debts—If you're carrying credit card balances, try to bring those close to zero to free up the cash you’ll need for necessities during your transition. Make sure you can cover any essential recurring payments that may have been on hold like mortgage, rent or student loans. Rethink your budget—Wants and non-essentials may need to take a backseat to needs while you're in transition. Take a good look at where you can cut back short term. Review your insurance—This is crucial, especially health insurance. If you've been covered through work, maybe you can switch to a spouse's policy. If not, look into COBRA and plans through the ACA at healthcare.gov. Whatever you do, make sure you and your family have continued coverage. If you've also had life or disability insurance through your employer, check with your HR department about portability. Look into individual coverage to avoid any gaps. Make your move from a place of security Right now, the job market is good and people are feeling more positive about the economy and the potential to find work. But anytime you make a job or career change, there are bound to be challenges. So make sure you're financially secure by thinking things through and planning ahead. That's the best way to assure you'll achieve your goal of personal satisfaction as well as financial reward. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have a well-deserved reputation for tax efficiency, but a close look at how the tax code treats different ETFs reveals quite a bit of complexity. If you want to understand the ins and outs of capital gains distributions, dividends, interest, K-1 statements, collectibles tax rates, and more, read on. You could save some money at tax time. Tax efficiency of equity ETFs and bond ETFs ETFs owe their reputation for tax efficiency primarily to equity ETFs, which can hold anywhere from a few dozen stocks to more than 7,000. Although similar to mutual funds, equity ETFs are generally more tax-efficient because they tend not to distribute a lot of capital gains. This is in large part because most ETFs passively track the performance of an index—which means they generally rebalance their holdings only when the underlying index changes its constituent stocks—whereas mutual funds are generally actively managed. ETF managers also have options for reducing capital gains when creating or redeeming ETF shares. That said, ETFs that hold dividend-paying stocks will ultimately distribute those dividends to shareholders—usually once a year, although dividend-focused ETFs may do so more frequently. ETFs holding bonds that pay interest will also distribute that interest to shareholders—monthly, in many cases. The IRS taxes dividends and interest payments from ETFs just like income from the underlying stocks or bonds, with the income being reported on your 1099 statement. Profits on ETFs sold at a gain are taxed like the underlying stocks or bonds as well. ETFs held for more than a year are taxed at the long-term capital gains rates—up to 23.8%, once you include the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) on high earners.* Equity and bond ETFs you hold for less than a year are taxed at the ordinary income rates, which top out at 40.8%. Precious metals ETFs: collectibles tax rate ETFs focused on precious metals such as silver and gold involve a different set of tax issues. ETFs backed by the physical metal itself (as opposed to futures contracts or stock in mining companies) are structured as grantor trusts. A grantor trust does nothing but hold the metal; it doesn\\'t buy and sell futures contracts or anything else. The IRS treats such ETFs the same as an investment in the metal itself, which—for tax purposes—would be considered an investment in collectibles. The maximum long-term capital gains rate on collectibles stands at 31.8% (including the NIIT), which is higher than the 23.8% top capital gains rate you\\'d pay for an equity ETF. Short-term gains on collectibles are taxed as ordinary income. (Other precious metals ETFs use futures, which involve a different tax treatment as we\\'ll see in the next section.) This doesn\\'t mean you should avoid precious metals as a tool for diversifying your portfolio. However, you should be aware of the different tax treatment to avoid surprises. Other commodity ETFs: K-1s and the 60/40 rule ETFs that invest in commodities other than precious metals—such as oil, corn, or aluminum—do so via futures contracts, primarily because holding the physical object in a vault is impractical. The use of futures can have a big impact on a portfolio\\'s returns because of contango and backwardation—that is, whether the included futures contracts are more expensive than the market price of the commodity (contango) or less expensive (backwardation). As futures contracts in the fund expire, the ETF may have to replace those expiring holdings with new ones, potentially taking a loss in some cases (contango) or a gain in others (backwardation). In addition, futures come with their own tax implications. Many ETFs that use futures are structured as limited partnerships and report the investor\\'s share of partnership income on Schedule K-1 instead of Form 1099. Some investors are wary of K-1s because they\\'re more complex to handle on a tax return, and the forms tend to arrive late in tax season. Investors may also worry about incurring unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) from their limited partnership investments that could be taxable even within an IRA. (See IRS Publication 598 for more information.) That said, commodity ETFs overall have a track record of sending K-1s in a timely manner (though usually sometime after most 1099s are available) and not generating UBTI. K-1s are more complex to handle on a tax return than 1099s, but professional tax preparers or well-informed individuals who do their own taxes should be able to handle K-1s correctly. Another noteworthy tax feature of ETFs that hold commodity futures contracts is the 60/40 rule. This rule, from IRS Publication 550, states that any gains or losses realized by selling these types of investments are treated as 60% long-term gains (up to 23.8% tax rate) and 40% short-term gains (up to 40.8% tax rate). This happens regardless of how long the investor has held the ETF. The blended rate could be an advantage for short-term investors (because 60% of gains receive the lower long-term rate) but a disadvantage for long-term investors (because 40% of gains are always taxed at the higher short-term rate). Furthermore, at the end of the year, the ETF must \"mark to market\" all of its outstanding futures contracts, treating them—for tax purposes—as if the fund had sold those contracts. Thus, if the ETF holds some contracts that have appreciated in value, it will have to realize those gains for tax purposes and distribute them to investors (who must then pay taxes on the gains following the 60/40 rule). To avoid the complexities of the partnership structure, newer commodity ETFs have been launched that typically invest up to 25% of their assets in an offshore subsidiary (usually in the Cayman Islands). Although the offshore subsidiary invests in futures contracts, the ETF\\'s investment in the subsidiary is considered by the IRS to be an equity holding. With the rest of its portfolio, the ETF may hold fixed-income collateral (typically Treasury securities) or commodity-related equities. This allows the fund to be structured as a traditional open-end fund, which won\\'t distribute a K-1 and is taxed like an equity or bond ETF at the same ordinary income and long-term capital gains rates. Currency ETFs Currency ETFs come in several different forms. Some are structured as open-end funds, also known as \\'40 Act funds, much like most equity and bond ETFs. Gains from the sale of these funds are taxed just like equity and bond ETFs: up to the 23.8% long-term rate or the 40.8% short-term rate. Other currency ETFs are structured as grantor trusts. Gains from selling these funds are always treated as ordinary income (currently up to the 40.8% rate). Currency ETFs structured as limited partnerships are taxed just like commodity limited partnerships—with K-1 statements and 60/40 long-term/short-term capital gains treatment. The bottom line with currency ETFs is that you should read a fund\\'s prospectus to see how the particular ETF will be taxed. Should you invest in exchange-traded notes (ETNs)? Instead of being backed by a portfolio of securities that are independent from the assets of an ETF manager, exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are bonds backed by the credit of the issuer. If the issuer is unable to repay the ETN shareholders, the shareholders will lose money. That\\'s why we often caution investors to carefully consider credit risk before investing in ETNs. They also have their own tax treatment. Because ETNs don\\'t hold securities of an underlying index, they generally don\\'t distribute dividends or interest. However, when you sell an ETN, you still could be subject to short- or long-term capital gains tax. Equity and bond ETNs work pretty much the same as their ETF equivalents, with long-term gains taxed up to 23.8% and short-term gains taxed as ordinary income. Commodity ETNs are similar. Currency ETNs are slightly different. The IRS has ruled that gains from selling currency ETNs are to be taxed as ordinary income at up to 40.8%, even if held for the long term, as if the ETN were a currency ETF structured as a grantor trust. How are ETFs and ETNs taxed in 2022? How are ETFs and ETNs taxed in 2022?

What does it all mean? These tax rates only apply if you hold ETFs and ETNs in a taxable account (like your brokerage account) rather than in a tax-deferred account (like an IRA). If you hold these investments in a tax-deferred account, you generally won\\'t be taxed until you make a withdrawal, and the withdrawal will be taxed at your current ordinary income tax rate. If you invest in stocks and bonds via ETFs, you probably won\\'t be in for many surprises. Investing in commodities and currencies is certainly more complicated. As more exotic ETFs come to market, we\\'ll possibly see new tax treatments, and no tax law is ever set in stone. Always consult with your tax professional for any questions about the taxation of ETFs. * The income threshold for NIIT is $200,000 for single filers, $125,000 for married filing separately, $200,000 for head of household, and $250,000 for married filing jointly or a qualifying widow(er) with a dependent child.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My partner and I aren\\'t legally married but have been living together for more than 15 years. Are we eligible for Social Security spousal benefits or survivor benefits if something should happen to either one of us? —A Reader Dear Reader, This question is increasingly relevant, so thanks for asking. According to a 2019 Pew Research Survey, a larger share of adults ages 18-44 have cohabited (59 percent) than have ever married (50 percent). You might think as more and more people choose to live together rather than marry, the laws that focus on traditional spousal benefits would also change. Not so. The simple answer to your question is that unless you live in a state that recognizes common-law marriage, neither you nor your partner are eligible for Social Security spousal or survivor benefits. However, if you live in a state that does, or a state that recognized common-law marriage in the past, you could be eligible for benefits—though it may not be quite so simple. That\\'s because while the Social Security Administration (SSA) follows the laws of individual states regarding common-law marriage, those state laws can vary considerably. And that\\'s where it can get complicated. Let\\'s start with the general definition of common-law marriage. Common-law marriage is about intent—not time There\\'s a misconception that common-law marriage is established by the length of time partners live together. That\\'s not entirely true. While cohabitation is a requirement in most states, there\\'s no exact time period. More important than time is how the partners present themselves. First of all, both have to be legally able to enter into a marriage, meaning both must be old enough (usually 18) and not married to someone else. Other factors beyond living together can include having joint accounts, owning property together, referring to each other as spouses, wearing wedding rings and generally being seen in the community as a married couple. Since you and your partner have been together for 15+ years, chances are you fit the general description. So now it depends on where you live. Individual states have their own requirements States that currently recognize common-law marriage are Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and Utah, as well as Washington D.C. Several other states recognize past common-law marriages up to a specific date, but that date is different in each state. There are also several states that don\\'t recognize common-law marriages themselves but will recognize such marriages from other states. If that\\'s not complicated enough, the requirements for establishing a common-law marriage also vary by state. So the first thing to do is check your own state\\'s current regulations. Another thing to be aware of is that the recognition of common-law marriage doesn\\'t automatically extend to same-sex couples in most states. You still have to provide \"proof\" to the SSA to get benefits Even if you and your partner live in a state that allows for common-law marriage and meet all the state requirements, the SSA won\\'t just take your word for it and grant you benefits. When you apply, you each have to provide an official statement affirming your marriage, and a statement from a blood relative of each spouse. If one partner has passed away, the SSA wants a statement from the surviving spouse plus statements from two blood relatives of the deceased and a blood relative of the surviving spouse. You may also have to provide evidence such as bank statements, insurance policies or mortgage/rent receipts. It\\'s important to understand how marriage can affect your benefits While money should never be the sole reason to marry, there are certain financial advantages, and they can be significant when it comes to Social Security. For instance, if there\\'s a big disparity in your incomes, a lower-earning spouse can get up to 50 percent of a higher-earning spouse\\'s benefit if it would be greater than their own. Plus, if the higher earner predeceases the lower earner, the surviving spouse would get 100 percent of the higher earner\\'s benefit. This may not change your attitude toward marriage, but I think it\\'s important to get the facts so you\\'ll know what you may be gaining—or giving up—based on your marital status. Beyond benefits: Ways to protect yourself and each other Married or not, there are other ways to make sure you and your partner are protected in case something happens to either of you. Save for retirement—Retirement accounts are always individual, even if you save together. If you have a 401(k) or similar plan, contribute enough to at least get any employer match. No 401(k)? There are other ways to save, including an IRA and an HSA. Update your beneficiaries—Designate primary and secondary beneficiaries on your retirement accounts and insurance policies. Don’t make assumptions about who your beneficiaries are. Title property accurately—If you own property together, be sure each of you is listed on the title. An unnamed partner would be vulnerable to losing the property in the case of splitting up or death Look into employee benefits—Check with an employer\\'s HR department to see what benefits apply to partners. This can include health and life insurance, dependent benefits and more. Have the right insurance—Whether or not you have domestic partner insurance benefits through an employer, make sure you each have adequate health care coverage. The same goes for life and disability insurance. Keep in mind that what you have through work may not be enough. Do some basic estate planning—Creating a basic estate plan will help protect you both. Each of you should at least have a Will designating the other as an heir, if that\\'s your desire, and naming a guardian for any dependents. Also, have an advance health care directive on file with your doctor and hospital. If you choose, you can give each other power of attorney for both financial and health care decisions should either of you become incapacitated. While Social Security spousal and survivor benefits can be a financial plus, if you\\'re not eligible, you and your partner can still take steps to provide your own financial security. Talk to each other and agree on what you need to do—for yourselves and for each other. As your situation changes, talk to a financial advisor and attorney to make sure you have the right plan in place. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'Investors are fascinated by the VIX Index due to its tendency to spike during market turmoil. VIX ETFs exist but they track VIX index futures, instead of the index directly. Find out why this can be an issue.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Investors often worry about market volatility—especially the kind of big negative moves seen during the credit crisis of 2008 or at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. It\\'s natural to look for investments that may increase in value when markets decline in order to get some downside protection, which is why some investors start looking toward the VIX®, a volatility index published by the Chicago Board Options Exchange.1 You can\\'t buy the VIX itself, though, and the exchange-traded products that use VIX futures have some big risks that investors should understand before buying. What is the VIX? The name VIX is an abbreviation for \"volatility index.\" Its actual calculation is complicated, but the basic goal is to measure how much volatility investors expect to see in the S&P 500® Index over the next 30 days, based on prices of S&P 500 Index options. When options traders think the stock market is likely to be calm, the VIX is low; when they expect big swings in the market, the VIX tends to go up. VIX index value over time Source: CSIA calculation based on Morningstar Direct data, as of April 30, 2021. During times of high market turmoil, the VIX has tended to rise. The chart above shows the VIX index moved steadily higher as the market approached the peak of the late 1990s technology bubble, calmed down during the steady growth period of 2003-2007, spiked during the 2008 credit crisis and in the latter half of 2011, and saw another large spike when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020. Because of this pattern of behavior, the VIX is sometimes referred to as the \"fear index\"—when market participants are worried about the market, the VIX tends to rise. Investors who see the VIX having increased sharply while the market went down might be tempted to seek an investment in the VIX as a source of potential protection during market volatility. Accessing the VIX through futures contracts Like all indexes, the VIX is not something you can buy directly. Moreover, unlike a stock index such as the S&P 500, you can\\'t even buy a basket of underlying components to mimic the VIX. Instead, the only way investors can access the VIX is through futures contracts and through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) that own those futures contracts. A futures contract is an agreement to deliver something at a certain point in the future, for a price that\\'s agreed upon in the present. The first futures contracts were for commodities such as wheat and corn, and they\\'re available for many commodities now, including oil and natural gas. Index futures, such as those tied to the value of an index like the S&P 500 or the VIX, do not involve actual delivery of anything when the futures contract matures. Instead, they use a cash delivery tied to the value of the index on the delivery date. The risks of VIX futures The potential problem, as with any futures contract, is contango—that is, when the futures price for something is higher than its current price. For instance, if VIX is at 15 today, and a one-month VIX futures contract is trading at 16, then the VIX futures market is in contango. Why is this a problem? Well, imagine that your goal is to always have a certain part of your portfolio invested in VIX futures. If the futures contracts are always more expensive than the current VIX level, then you pay a premium every time you buy futures. You\\'re essentially buying high and selling low, which erodes the value of your investment over time. VIX futures and contango in action The contango problem isn\\'t purely academic; VIX futures contracts have often been more expensive than the VIX index. According to Bloomberg, in 49 of the past 60 months dating back to April 2016, the three-month VIX futures contract was above the VIX level. You can see the effect in action in the chart below. Value of $10,000 invested in VIX or VIX futures Source: CSIA calculation based on Morningstar Direct data, as of April 30, 2021. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. In this figure, you can see what $10,000 would be worth if it had been invested in the VIX itself (which, as mentioned earlier, is impossible), a portfolio of short-term VIX futures contracts, or a portfolio of medium-term VIX futures contracts over the previous five years. These portfolios are based on actual exchange-traded funds that buy VIX futures contracts. As you can see, the futures contracts have lagged significantly behind the value of the VIX index. By the end of the period, the value of $10,000 hypothetically invested in the VIX itself would have risen to over $13,000, while the portfolio of medium-term VIX futures contracts was worth under $7,000, and the short-term VIX futures contracts had fallen to under $500. Had an investor actually been able to buy the VIX, the investment would have made some money, but the actual investable instruments based on VIX (including ETFs and ETNs tied to those instruments) lost significant amounts of money. Just because an investment has VIX in its name doesn\\'t mean that it will move in line with the VIX Index. Furthermore, as the charts show, the VIX itself can be extremely volatile—the index lost 54% of its value between March 2020 and July 2020. Investors cannot buy VIX, and even if they could, it would be an investment with a great deal of risk. 1The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index® (VIX®) reflects a market estimate of future volatility. VIX is constructed using the implied volatilities of a wide range of S&P 500 index options. This volatility is meant to be forward-looking and is calculated from both calls and puts.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'How to make the most of a Roth IRA conversion.',\n",
       "   'content': 'A Roth IRA conversion may be right for you if your income is too high to contribute to a Roth IRA outright ($140,000 and up for individuals in 2021; $208,000 and up for married couples filing jointly). With this strategy, you convert all or part of your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and pay regular income taxes on the converted amount. It may seem counterintuitive to pay taxes now that you could put off until later, but doing so will allow you to take advantage of a Roth IRA\\'s main benefit: tax-free withdrawals of contributions and earnings in retirement (so long as you’re age 59½ or older and have held the account for at least five years). \"It\\'s an attractive option for individuals who believe their tax rate may be higher in retirement, or for those who just want the flexibility that tax-free income provides,\" says Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"And, unlike tax-deferred retirement accounts, Roth IRAs aren’t subject to required minimum distributions beginning at age 72.\" If you think a Roth IRA conversion might be right for you, Rob points to three tax-efficient strategies: Max out your bracket: Let\\'s say you’re single and make $145,000 a year, which puts you in the 24% tax bracket. The next bracket doesn\\'t kick in until your income exceeds $164,925, so you could convert $19,925 ($164,925 – $145,000) and still stay within your current bracket. Spread it out: Breaking up the conversion across multiple years can make the tax hit easier to manage—and could, when combined with the strategy above, reduce the overall tax you pay on the conversion.1 Get ahead of tax changes: If upcoming changes to tax law will adversely affect future taxes, converting some or all of your traditional IRA in the year preceding the change could help you avoid paying more tax on the conversion than necessary. In any case, you may want to wait until the end of the year to perform the conversion. \"That way, you can account for any year-end changes to your total taxable income,” Rob says. 1For savers younger than 59½, each conversion must be held for at least five years to be eligible for penalty-free withdrawals of the conversion principal.'},\n",

But looming tax changes could alter that: A Biden administration proposal could cut the federal estate tax exemption to its 2009 levels of $3.5 million per person and $7 million per married couple. (If adopted, those exemption levels may or may not be adjusted annually to offset the effects of inflation.) Even if that proposal doesn\\'t make it into law, the current estate tax exemption is set to revert to pre-2017 levels of $5 million per person and $10 million per married couple starting in 2026 (though both of those figures will be adjusted upward to account for inflation). And if you live in one of the 12 states (or the District of Columbia) that levies taxes on estates—the lowest of which kicks in at $1 million—you could face such taxes regardless of what happens with the federal exemption. \"With all of the what-ifs around estate taxes, it\\'s important to have a plan in place that will protect your heirs, come what may,\" says George Pennock, director of trust planning services at Charles Schwab Trust Company in Henderson, Nevada. Here, Bob and George highlight three trust types that can help. 1. A-B Trust How it works: When one member of a married couple passes away, the couple\\'s assets are separated into two trusts: A survivor\\'s or \"A\" trust, which is revocable (meaning it can be changed) and belongs to the surviving spouse. A bypass or \"B\" trust, which is irrevocable (meaning it can\\'t be changed) but can provide income to the surviving spouse before being passed down to the trust\\'s beneficiaries tax-free upon the surviving spouse\\'s death. Who it\\'s for: Spouses don\\'t pay estate tax on assets inherited from each other thanks to the unlimited marital deduction, which allows an individual to transfer an unrestricted amount of assets tax-free to their spouse at any time, including at her or his death. \"However, over time, appreciation alone can easily push a sizable estate over the estate tax exemption for your heirs,\" Bob says. \"By moving some of those assets into a bypass trust at the time of the first spouse\\'s death, they\\'re excluded from the surviving spouse\\'s estate even as he or she derives income from it.\" 2. Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) How it works: The GRAT\\'s creator transfers assets into a fixed-term, irrevocable trust. During the term (of at least two years), the creator receives annuity payments that pay the value of the assets back to them in their entirety—plus a fixed interest (or \"hurdle\") rate set by the IRS. When the term expires, any growth in the invested assets over and above the hurdle rate passes to the trust\\'s beneficiaries tax-free.1 If the creator passes away before the term ends, however, the value of the remaining assets, including earnings, will be included in her or his taxable estate. Who it\\'s for: A GRAT is most useful for those with assets that are likely to appreciate substantially during their lifetimes, such as a closely held business, real estate, or stocks. \"A GRAT allows you to move some of that appreciation out of your estate, thereby reducing its overall size,\" George says. \"And if the assets don\\'t appreciate as expected, the GRAT\\'s \\'substitution transaction\\' provision allows you to, during the annuity term, swap them out for assets of equal value that may appreciate more.\" 3. Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) How it works: This irrevocable trust distributes a portion of the donated assets—at least 5% annually but no more than 50%—to its creator or another beneficiary for a specified term (or life). At the end of the term or the creator\\'s death, the remainder goes to one or more designated charities. There are two main types of CRTs: Charitable remainder annuity trust (CRAT), which distributes a fixed annuity amount each year and does not allow additional contributions. Charitable remainder unitrust (CRUT), which distributes a fixed percentage of the trust assets annually and does allow additional contributions. Who it\\'s for: Those who want to reduce the eventual size of their taxable estate while receiving an immediate partial tax deduction on the value of the assets transferred into the trust. \"The beauty of charitable gifts is that they don\\'t eat into your estate tax exemption,\" Bob says. \"And with a CRT, you can receive an immediate partial tax deduction on the portion of the assets earmarked for charity, which must be at least 10%.\" What\\'s more, putting highly appreciated assets into a CRT preserves their full fair market value because the trust is not required to pay capital gains taxes on the sale of those assets. Keep in mind Estate taxes are always a moving target, so it\\'s important to revisit your estate plan—including your trust provisions—regularly. \"With so many changes on the horizon, it\\'s wise to keep in close contact with your team—accountant, attorney, financial planner, etc.—who can help you think through your options and keep your overall planning on track,\" George says. 1Naming grandchildren as a GRAT\\'s beneficiaries could trigger generation-skipping transfer taxes. Consult a tax professional before making any decisions.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My 32-year-old daughter is saving consistently for retirement, but she recently confessed her discouragement at hearing you need at least $1 million to retire comfortably. Is that truly how much she\\'ll need? —A Reader Dear Reader, With some financial experts saying you\\'ll need a million dollars—or more—to retire, I don\\'t blame your daughter for feeling discouraged. Throwing around big numbers is easy, but saving that much can definitely be a challenge. The good news is that saving consistently when you\\'re young gives you a much better chance of reaching your goal, thanks to the effects of compound growth—and your daughter still has plenty of time on her side. But more to your point: Does everybody need $1 million or more to retire comfortably? No—some will need less, some will need more. Indeed, being a millionaire is no longer the measure of wealth it once was, especially in areas with high housing and living costs. It all depends on when she wants to retire, where she\\'ll live and under what circumstances, and what other income sources might be available to her. In short, your daughter\\'s retirement savings goal should be based on her personal situation rather than a rule of thumb. Let\\'s take a look at how much your daughter might need to save—and what it will take for her to get there. Finding her number It\\'s hard to think so far ahead when you\\'re young—and there are a lot of variables that can change in the intervening years—but planning now will help her get a realistic handle on how much she should save for the future. Conservatively, she might want to assume she\\'ll need to spend about as much in retirement as she does today to maintain her current standard of living—less certain expenses like retirement contributions and payroll taxes that she likely won\\'t have when she\\'s retired. That said, retirement is dynamic, and everyone\\'s situation is different, so it may help for her to dig into the details of her expenses and use a monthly budget planner to determine her specific income needs. From there, a useful guideline is to aim for a portfolio that\\'s 25 times the amount she\\'d like to withdraw during her first year of retirement, after accounting for potential guaranteed income sources like Social Security, pensions, and annuities. So let\\'s say she currently earns $60,000 and expects to receive $20,000 in annual Social Security benefits. That means she\\'ll need to withdraw $40,000 from her savings in her first year of retirement. Using the calculation above, she would need to save $1 million ($40,000 × 25) to support her income needs for a 30-year retirement. Fortunately, saving that much may not be as difficult as it seems. Reaching her number So, what does it take to save a million dollars? When you\\'re young, not as much as you might think. If you were to start saving at age 25, for example, you\\'d need to sock away about $508 per month (and earn a 6% average annual return) to reach $1 million by age 65. If you were to start saving at age 35, on the other hand, you\\'d need to save $995 per month, or almost twice as much (see \"Time is of the essence,\" below). Time is of the essence The sooner you start saving, the less you need to sock away each month to reach $1 million by age 65. Schwab Center for Financial Research. Examples assume a 6% average annual return. Monthly contributions are rounded to the nearest dollar. This chart is hypothetical and for informational purposes only. If that number feels unrealistic given her current income, talk about reasonable steps she can take to make it work for her. For example, is she contributing at least enough to her retirement plan to capture any employer match? If not, encourage her to do so—it\\'s effectively free money! If she isn\\'t able to save any more right now, can she commit to increasing her contributions at the start of every year or each time she gets a raise? And finally, is her portfolio invested for long-term growth—meaning with a healthy allocation to equities, which tend to have a higher rate of return than, say, bonds? The good news is that she has time to make up for any shortfalls in her nest egg—so long as she commits to saving and investing consistently. Reaching a financial goal is a confluence of making large and small positive changes that can add up over time. Making a plan Help her create a list of goals (big and small) and when she\\'d like to reach them. Then establish a baseline that includes her net worth, current expenses, and sources of income. This will show her where she is right now and what steps she needs to take next, as well as identify gaps in her strategy. These ideas may be commonplace to you, but they may be eye-opening to your daughter and help her feel more in control. Schwab MoneyWise® contains great information for beginners of all ages. If you\\'re comfortable, you could even share your own retirement strategy—or take it a step further and encourage her to talk to an advisor. Just as it\\'s never too early to start saving, it\\'s never too early to start planning. A financial planner can help her strategize the best way to reach her aspirations—not just for retirement but for other goals, as well. To me, saving can be liberating when it\\'s on your terms. Your good counsel—and a personalized financial plan—can help free her from other people\\'s financial expectations and set her on a positive course toward the retirement that\\'s right for her.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Identifying so-called head-and-shoulders patterns can be tricky but profitable.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Take a look at any intraday stock chart and you're bound to see head-and-shoulders patterns—a central peak flanked by two smaller peaks—popping out all over the place. These triple-peaked chart patterns can be useful indicators of a major trend reversal but are also among the easiest to misread. Indeed, many investors have paid a steep price for placing a trade without waiting for signals confirming the pattern. What to look for To detect a true head-and-shoulders trend reversal, it helps to understand how they're created: The left shoulder forms when investors pushing a stock higher temporarily lose enthusiasm. The head forms when enthusiasm peaks and then declines to a point at or near the stock's previous low. The right shoulder forms as the stock price rallies once again but fails to reach its previous high before falling again. A fourth component—the neckline—is formed by drawing a line underneath the troughs established just before and just after the head. When the stock's price dips below this trend line, it's usually a strong indication that the pattern has broken and it's time to sell your position. Note that inverse head-and-shoulders patterns—which are just the reverse, with the head and shoulders forming valleys instead of peaks—can also offer useful trading signals, but more on those below. Confirming signals Even when the stock price breaches the neckline, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a lock to continue in that direction. To help confirm the trend, you should consider two more factors: Volume: The number of shares trading is one indication of the strength behind a price move. With a classic head-and-shoulders pattern (see chart above), you'll see the trading volume start to lessen as the price moves higher toward the head and then again when it rebounds to form the right shoulder, indicating limited investor enthusiasm. A spike in volume when the price moves below the neckline suggests that selling pressure will remain intense. If neither of these volume signals is in play, the decline may be short-lived, though there are no guarantees. Time frame: Profitable trend reversals require strong trends leading into them. One commonly used rule of thumb is that the uptrend heading into the pattern should be at least twice as long as the distance between the shoulders. This makes it more likely that any reversal of the trend will be significant enough to trade, and that rule of thumb applies whether you're looking at an intraday opportunity or a lengthier one. Setting your stops Now that you know what to look for, how do you trade it? By using some of the same risk-management tools that are part of your regular trading plan. Stop orders, in particular, can be useful for head-and-shoulders opportunities, both for limiting your losses from downward price moves if you own the stock, and for initiating a position in an inverse head-and-shoulder when the stock breaks higher through the neckline. However, be aware that there is no guarantee a stop order will be executed at or near the stop price. (For profit-taking, consider placing limit orders at your target price.) If you already own a stock and believe a traditional head-and-shoulders pattern may be developing, identify the potential neckline when the stock is forming the right shoulder and set your sell-stop price just below it. For instance, if the stock retreated to $35, rebounded to a new high of $37 and then retreated back to $35 before climbing back up, consider setting your sell-stop price just under the possible new support level of $35. If you're looking to add a position, the formation of an inverse head and shoulders, with a stock price breaking above the neckline, often indicates a bearish trend has ended and the stock is poised for higher highs. In such cases, set your buy-stop price just above the neckline. For example, if the stock rebounds to $35, retreats to a new low of $33 and then climbs back up to $35 before again declining, consider setting your buy-stop order just above perceived resistance at $35. Measure twice, sell once A unique feature of inverse head-and-shoulders patterns is that they can be used to estimate a profit target after the pattern is complete (as shown in the chart below). To determine the target spread: Measure the vertical distance from the head to the neckline. Find the breakout point—where the price first breaks the neckline after the right shoulder forms—and add that distance to the breakout price. Target practice Inverse head-and-shoulders patterns can help traders identify profit targets. Some technical analysts believe this can give you a good sense for how far the price could climb based on the size of the pattern, and where you should consider setting your limit-sell price. Patience is profitable In my experience, those new to technical analysis tend to see head-and-shoulders patterns everywhere. That's why taking the time to confirm signals, such as volume and the time frame of the preceding trends, is usually worth it. After a while, it will get easier to separate the heads and shoulders from the head fakes. *Green volume bars indicate days on which the stock closed higher than the previous day; red bars indicate days on which it closed lower.\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I keep hearing about the threat of inflation and am starting to feel it when I open up my wallet. Should I be concerned? —A Reader Dear Reader, Great question and you’re not alone. Lately, I’m hearing from lots of readers concerned about sharp increases in the cost of big-ticket items like housing and cars to everyday purchases like gas and groceries. Much of the concern about rising prices depends on your age and circumstances. Many older investors recall the double-digit inflation and gas lines of the 70’s and are understandably worried about the ability of their savings to keep pace over time. The sentiment may be very different for young people who have only known low inflation. Unless they\\'re competing for a house or shopping for a car, inflation may not seem like such a big deal. Whether current inflation bursts are an anomaly or a sneak peek into what lies ahead is a bit of a guessing game, even for economists. Only time will tell, but many experts believe that the Federal Reserve and prudent government policy will prevent an extended period of high inflation. Bottom line, we need to be positioned to weather whatever happens. Inflation is mostly about supply and demand To a large extent, inflation is about supply and demand—a lot of money chasing limited goods and services pushes prices up. As our economy recovers from the pandemic, we have record savings combined with pent-up demand for everything from home improvement projects to cars to travel. All of those weddings and celebrations that were postponed? For now, people seem to be willing to pay more for everything they missed. It’s a welcome bonanza for the hotels, airlines, caterers and florists who suffered for a year and a half. But how will rising inflation affect you? The answer largely depends on what you’re spending your money on and what alternative choices you have available. While older people may be more vulnerable to increases in health care costs, inflation can also be hard for younger people who may be raising children and paying for childcare or college. It’s one thing to decide to postpone a vacation and an entirely different situation if you’re buying groceries or paying a medical bill. That’s a lot of the reason inflation isn\\'t consistent across the board. Inflation compounds over time It may be easy to dismiss a few percentage points of price increases (the Fed considers about 2 percent inflation to be the sweet spot to keep the economy ticking but not overheat), but the truth is that even small amounts of inflation can seriously erode your net worth and purchasing power over time. Not to be macabre, but that’s why some people refer to inflation as “the silent killer.\" As an example, a 3 percent rate of inflation will cut your purchasing power by 26 percent after 10 years and 45 percent after 20 years. Retiring with $1 million dollars may sound fine today, but if we have a relatively modest but consistent inflation rate of 3 percent a year, that $1 million will have the purchasing power of about $560,000 in twenty years—and less if inflation is higher. This is precisely the reason we need our investments to outpace inflation. Five steps to help counter inflation It’s great to understand how inflation works, but even more important to take appropriate action. Here are five ways you can protect yourself against higher inflation. Stay invested—and diversified. Probably your strongest defense against long-term inflation is maintaining a globally diversified portfolio. Over long periods of time stocks have historically outpaced inflation, and fixed income funds (including money market and bond funds) will generally reinvest in newer holdings that may have higher yields. As part of a diversified portfolio you can also consider incorporating Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), Series I Savings Bonds and other asset classes into your portfolio to hedge against higher inflation. But whatever you do, don’t attempt to \"time\" the market by jumping in and out as the markets shift. History suggests that the best course is to stay invested over time. You can also consider dollar -cost averaging to gradually increase your holdings. Pay off variable debt—or at least move to fixed rates. As inflation rises, so do variable interest rates. It’s never a good idea to carry expensive consumer debt (which is often variable), but as interest rates rise, you’ll pay even more. If you believe inflation is picking up, look into refinancing any adjustable-rate loans (for example, your mortgage) to a fixed rate. Prepay, buy in bulk or substitute. As prices rise, consider prepaying for big-ticket items. This could include an appliance you know you’ll need to replace or even college tuition. Ask yourself if there are cheaper alternatives when buying a good or service. Build inflation into your financial plan. One of the best tools for combatting inflation is to consider how it can affect your financial plan. That way, you\\'re much more likely to meet your future goals—from college to retirement. People who are in retirement and rely on a fixed income are often the hardest hit by inflation, so it’s especially important to be flexible with your spending based on changing market and inflation conditions. Run different scenarios with a range of projections and don\\'t forget to include health care. Keep fees to a minimum. Finally, don’t overlook the insidious way high fees can eat into your investment dollars. This is true no matter what inflation does, but especially important when inflation is already taking its bite. Expecting the unexpected When we financial planners talk about ‘expecting the unexpected’ we’re usually referring to things like insurance and emergency savings—and those are essential. But anticipating and being prepared for inflation—in your spending, saving, investing, college planning and retirement planning is equally important. You can’t control the economy, but you can be smart about how you control your own money. Therefore, my response to your question is not to worry, but to remain aware—and prepared.

       "   'content': 'Working after retirement can raise financial questions. First, earning a salary after you\\'ve registered for government programs such as Social Security and Medicare can affect your taxes and maybe even lead to a temporary reduction in your benefits. And there are additional rules governing the way you use the money in your tax-advantaged retirement savings. None of this should be taken as a reason not to work if you want to do it. But it is important that you understand how the rules could affect you if you get back on the job. Here are some of the key questions to ask. Can I start contributing to my retirement accounts again? In most cases, under current law, you should be able to contribute to your employer\\'s qualified retirement plan regardless of your age. If you meet relevant income limits,1 you can also contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA if you have earned income. Whether the IRA contribution is tax deductible depends on your income and whether you\\'re also an active participant in an employer-provided retirement plan. There are no age limits for Roth IRAs, although income restrictions apply. Will I need to take required minimum distributions from my IRA or 401(k) if I go back to work? Working in retirement doesn\\'t affect RMDs from IRAs. If you\\'ve reached age 72, you will have to take them from a traditional IRA. There are no RMD requirements for a Roth IRA. The rules for qualified employer plans, such as 401(k)s, are different. If you continue to work past age 72 and do not own more than 5% of the business you work for, most plans allow you to postpone RMDs from your current—but not a prior—employer\\'s plan until no later than April 1 of the year after you finally stop working. If you have a 401(k) from a prior employer, you may still be subject to the RMD requirement. Check with your plan administrator for both your new and prior employers. For details please see the IRS topic \"Retirement Plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs.\" If I go back to work, should I change my asset allocation to account for my new income? Generally, no. Having additional income from a job should work with your existing allocation, assuming it\\'s appropriately geared toward accomplishing your goals. If your main goal is having enough to cover your spending in retirement, we generally recommend a stock allocation of at least 20% (conservative) but no more than 60% (moderate). Depending on your age, time horizon, and spending needs, such a portfolio should stand a pretty good chance of lasting for your lifetime. How much you\\'ve already saved is another issue. If you currently have more than you need to cover your spending in retirement, you can be a little more flexible with your stock allocation. Again, this will depend on your personal circumstances, time horizon, spending relative to the size of your portfolio, and risk tolerance. Will returning to work affect my pension? The rules vary, depending on the plan, so check with your pension plan provider and the human resources department at your new employer to see if returning to work will affect your benefits or pension payments. This is especially important if you return to work for a former employer. The bottom line Working in retirement can help you earn extra money to cover your day-to-day expenses and keep you active and engaged. Just be aware that you may also need to make a few small adjustments to your retirement plans. Don\\'t hesitate to get help from a financial planner and tax professional with the more complex tax and retirement benefit implications. 1There are no income limits for contributing to a traditional IRA. However, if your adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022 is more than $78,000 ($129,000 for married couples filing jointly or a qualifying widow(er)), your contribution will not be tax-deductible. For a Roth IRA, you may only contribute if your AGI for 2022 is less than $144,000 ($214,000 for married couples filing jointly or a qualifying widow(er)). See IRS Publication 590-A for more information.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Are you retired but considering going back to work? Whether you\\'re in it for the extra income, or merely getting paid for something you enjoy doing anyway, it\\'s important to understand how bringing home a paycheck in retirement could affect your Social Security benefits and medical insurance coverage. Here are a few things to consider before punching that timecard. Your Social Security benefits could be reduced—temporarily Your age matters here, as we\\'ll see below, but any reductions that do occur are temporary. The IRS will eventually recalculate your benefit and give you credit for months when you didn\\'t receive a benefit, thereby boosting your future benefit. So, don\\'t let a temporary reduction in payments keep you from returning to work. (For more information, refer to \"How we deduct earnings from benefits,\" at www.ssa.gov.) Here\\'s how the age rules work: If you haven\\'t yet reached your full retirement age (FRA)—between 66 and 67 for people born in 1943 or later—working could mean temporarily giving up $1 in benefits for every $2 you earn above the annual limit ($19,560 in 2022). Here\\'s an example of how that might look: Example 1 You retire early and go back to work before reaching your FRA. Your annual salary is $30,000. Because you are $10,440 over the annual limit, your Social Security benefits are reduced by $5,220. If you go back to work during the year you reach FRA, $1 in benefits will be deducted for every $3 you earn above a higher limit ($51,960 in 2022), but only counting earnings before the month you reach your FRA. Example 2 You work all year and reach your full retirement age in June. From January 1 to May 31 you earned $15,000. Because your earnings are under the limit, your Social Security benefits for the year are unaffected. Example 3 You work all year and reach your full retirement age in June. From January 1 to May 31 you earn $53,360. At this point you have earned $1,400 over the annual limit, which reduces your Social Security benefits for the year by $466. Starting the month you hit your full retirement age, your benefits are no longer reduced no matter how much you earn. Remember, as long as you\\'re working, you (and your employer, if applicable) will need to pay the Social Security Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax. Because Social Security benefits are based on your highest 35 years of income, the additional earnings may boost your Social Security benefits by replacing or filling in years where you had little or no earnings. You can estimate how much your annual benefits will be reduced by using the SSA\\'s Retirement Earnings Test Calculator. For more information, see the SSA publication \"How Work Affects Your Benefits.\" Your Social Security benefits could be taxable Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) matters here. As your MAGI increases above a certain threshold (from earning a paycheck, for instance, or certain other income sources), a greater percentage of your benefits is subject to income tax, to a maximum of 85%. For details, see IRS Publication 915, \"Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits,\" or consult with a tax advisor. You can pay back benefits you\\'ve already received—and boost your future benefit If you\\'ve taken Social Security benefits early at a reduced rate, you have the option of paying back to the government what you\\'ve already received and restarting benefits at a later date with a higher payout. (You receive your largest monthly benefit by delaying retirement until age 70, but not beyond, so it never makes sense to wait past that age.) Keep in mind that you will need to repay the gross amount of your benefit—which includes any withholdings for Medicare premiums and/or income tax. For example, say you chose to receive benefits at 62 and nine months later decided you wanted to return to work. You could stop receiving Social Security by withdrawing your application for benefits, pay back the benefits received, return to work, and then defer your benefit up to age 70, when you could restart your benefits at a higher level. The option to pay back Social Security is limited to the first 11 months\\' worth of benefits, and the SSA allows repayment only in the first year after you start to receive benefits. Once you reach full retirement age, another option is to voluntarily stop benefits at any point in time before age 70 to receive delayed retirement credits (spousal benefits will be stopped as well). Benefits will automatically restart at age 70 at a higher amount, unless you choose an earlier date. Take note that when you withdraw your application or stop your benefits after full retirement age, you must specify if your Medicare coverage—if you have it—should be included in the withdrawal. You may need to do some planning with any employer health insurance Eligibility for employer-offered group health insurance is one of the primary reasons many people under age 65 stay in, or return to, the work force. If you\\'re 65 or older and already covered by Medicare, check with your employer\\'s human resources department about how their insurance coverage would work with your Medicare. In short, Medicare could help pick up the tab for expenses not covered by your group plan, but the rules vary depending on how many employees your employer has. For more information, read \"Medicare and Other Health Benefits: Your Guide to Who Pays First.\" If you have private health insurance, compare your benefits and coverage with plans offered by a new employer. Although group plans tend to be less expensive than individual policies, you could be better off keeping your individual policy rather than canceling it and hoping you can get your old coverage and rates back later. Make sure you enroll on time, and be careful with your HSA Both Medicare and Medigap have specific enrollment periods, and if you miss them you could be hit with late-enrollment penalties. However, you may be able to enroll after age 65 without penalties if, for a period after you reach age 65, you receive employer coverage. Pay close attention to Medicare enrollment periods if you have retiree health insurance from a former employer or are under COBRA. These types of coverage do not allow you to defer enrollment past age 65 without penalties and may leave gaps in your coverage. Also note that once you are enrolled in Medicare, you\\'re not permitted to make contributions to a Health Savings Account (HSA). If you enroll in Medicare after reaching age 65, Medicare will backdate your enrollment by six months (but no earlier than age 65). To avoid an IRS penalty, make sure you stop contributions to the HSA in time. The bottom line Returning to work after retirement is ultimately a personal decision. If it supports your goals and financial needs, then go for it. With a little planning, your new job can complement your Social Security and health insurance arrangements. As always, contact your financial advisor or other trusted financial professional if you have questions.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Fundamental and technical analysis are two common ways to sort and pick stocks. How and when to use them can be a matter of personal style, but each has its strengths. Fundamental analysis attempts to identify stocks offering strong growth potential at a good price by examining the underlying company’s business, as well as conditions within its industry or in the broader economy. Investors have traditionally used fundamental analysis for longer-term trades, relying on metrics such as earnings per share, price-to-earnings ratio, price-to-earnings growth, and dividend yield. Technical analysis, on the other hand, bypasses the underlying company’s fundamentals and instead looks for statistical patterns on stock charts that might foretell future price and volume moves. The idea here is that stock prices already reflect all the publicly available information about a particular company, so there’s nothing to be gained from poring over a balance sheet. Given the focus on price and volume moves, traders have traditionally used technical analysis for shorter-term trades. But does it have to be an either/or proposition? Which type of analysis is right for you? Both forms of analysis can reveal potentially valuable information, and focusing on just one style could cause you to miss important clues about a stock’s value. And since the intended duration of a trade may change, employing both forms of analysis might be your best approach. Why not deploy them so their strengths complement each other? Use fundamental factors to select the candidate, and technical factors to dictate the ideal entry or exit price. First, focus on fundamentals Investors who use fundamental analysis generally use one of two fundamentals-oriented strategies: Growth investors focus on the future prospects of a particular company. Value investors focus on whether the current stock price makes sense given the health of a particular company. Growth investor’s strategy Corporations are generally built to grow and turn a profit—and eventually return some of that profit to shareholders. Very few new companies are immediately profitable. But if a company reports strong revenue growth initially—even if it fails to turn a profit in its early days—growth investors may still decide it’s a good prospect for the future. When investors decide a young company has an innovative product or compelling competitive advantage, they may start to drive the stock’s price higher. The more investors who join the party, the higher the company’s stock price is likely to rise. Such investors typically focus on metrics such as a company’s historical and projected revenue growth rates when buying shares of relatively new companies. Value investor’s strategy Value investors seek out larger, more established companies that appear to be priced below what their revenues or earnings per share would suggest. Such investors often focus on industry-leading companies, which are generally past their peak revenue growth years, because such companies often pay steady dividends. Value stocks tend to have low price-to-earnings ratios and pay above average dividends, but trade at a price that is very low or below their book value (total tangible assets minus total liabilities). Sometimes value investing is described as investing in great companies at a good price, not simply buying cheap stocks. Screening for growth or value Schwab clients can use the stock screening tool on Schwab.com to help narrow down a collection of stocks to a manageable list of quality growth or value candidates. Source: Schwab.com When screening for fundamental factors, consider focusing on stocks rated A or B by Schwab Equity Ratings® (SER), as these are considered “buy” candidates. In the example below, this step alone narrows the list of possible stocks from 2,800 candidates to 824 candidates. Source: Schwab.com Growth screening Since Schwab Equity Ratings already takes many fundamental factors into account, investors searching for growth stocks could seek out stocks that have delivered strong revenue growth in the past, and look set to deliver both strong revenue and profit growth in the future. In the example below, selecting these three additional criteria narrows the list of 824 candidates to just six. Source: Schwab.com Value screening You can use several metrics when searching for value stocks, though a simple approach would be to consider those with: An above-average dividend yield (but not too high) Low price-to-earnings ratio A price that is less than the company’s book value In the example below, selecting these three additional criteria shrinks the list of 824 down to just five. Source: Schwab.com As you search, be wary of extremely high dividend-yielding stocks, as they might be too good to be true. On a similar note, keep in mind cheap doesn’t necessarily mean good. A low stock price could be the result of a company’s outdated products, bad management, expired patents, pending lawsuits, etc. Once you’ve got a more manageable list of five or six, it’s time to apply some technical screens. Technical signals Stock selection using technical analysis generally involves three steps: stock screening, chart scanning, and setting up the trade. With stock screening, your goal is to arrive at a list of 20 or 25 candidates using a set of technical criteria. You will then try to narrow that list down to three or four candidates by scanning the charts for possible entries, or points where it could make sense to buy. Finally, you will perform a more detailed chart analysis and choose the one you’ll trade. To illustrate this process, let’s assume you’re the kind of trader who holds a stock anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Screen stocks using technical analysis To set up a screen, consider the following items: Price and market capitalization. This can be a good place to start as it allows you to eliminate a lot of stocks right away. For example, if you’re not interested in stocks priced over $100, you could exclude them in the screen. Sectors and industries. Look for strong sector and industry groups if you want to go long—that is, buy a stock with the expectation that its price will rise—and weak ones if you want to go short—which means borrowing and selling a stock whose price you think is going to fall, and then buying it back later at a lower price should it actually fall, all with the expectation that you’ll pocket the difference. Momentum. The technical trader usually wants to identify strong, up-trending stocks for potential buys and weak down-trending stocks for shorts. One way to find them is to use moving averages, which are trend-following indicators that smooth out day-to-day price movements to show a stock’s general direction over time. They can also act as support and resistance levels. Support is where downward trends tend to weaken as buying pressure overcomes selling pressure. Resistance is often where upward trends start to fizzle as selling pressure overcomes buying pressure. A simple moving average is calculated by averaging a stock’s closing prices over a defined period. Many traders use 20 days as a starting point, but you can use different periods according to your trading style. A momentum trader going long might ask, is a stock trading above its 20-day moving average? Has its 20-day moving average broken above its 50-day moving average? A trader looking to short a stock might search for one trading below its 20-day moving average, and whose 20-day moving average is below its 50-day moving average. You might narrow the list further by looking for stocks that trade at least 200,000 shares a day. Scan charts After compiling a list of candidates, it’s time to look for those with good entry points. Two common entry strategies are to look for breakouts in the direction of the trend—that is, stocks experiencing a sharp upward movement in price—and pullbacks, which are short-term moves in the opposite direction of the longer-term trend. For breakouts on longs, an entry point could be the first or second new high after the stock has traded sideways for a few days. For breakouts on shorts, an entry point could be the first or second new low after a few days of sideways movement. With the pullback strategy, you’ll want to see the stock correct for a few days in the direction opposite the trend. You might then consider buying into that short-term weakness on the longs, or selling into that short-term strength on the shorts. Trade setup We’ll assume for the sake of discussion that you prefer pullback entries and have narrowed your choices down to two buy candidates, stock A and stock B. To choose between them, it could make sense to bring a few indicators to bear: price patterns, volume, moving averages, and an indicator called the stochastic oscillator. Because we’re looking for pullbacks, our first task is to confirm a price change is likely to be a temporary move and not full-on reversal. Chances of a reversal are lower if the stock has pulled back to a support level, such as a moving average or an old low. We also want to know if a pullback is ending. For example, if a stock can push past the previous day’s high, it could mean the uptrend resuming. On to our charts. We can see that both stocks A and B have pulled back and held their 20-day moving averages (the yellow lines). So far, so good. Stock A Source: StreetSmart Edge Stock B Source: StreetSmart Edge Here’s where we bring in the stochastic oscillator. Basically, this is a momentum indicator that compares a stock’s current price to its highs and lows over a given period. Values can range from 0 to 100, with a reading over 75 indicating that the stock may be “overbought” and possibly overextended on the upside. Readings under 25 indicate that the stock is “oversold” and possibly overextended on the downside. On a chart, the stochastic oscillator consists of two lines, the %K (fast line, in red in the chart above) and %D (slow line, in blue). The former is the value for the current trading session. The latter is a three-day moving average of the former. When a stock is trading in a particular range, and the oscillator’s values move into overbought or oversold areas, look for a price reversal. However, be warned that if a stock is strongly trending in a particular direction over a long period, the values could stay in overbought or oversold territory for an extended period. In either case, it can make sense to compare the %K and %D lines. If the lines are converging or diverging, it could signal a shift in momentum is in the works. Let’s apply this to our hypothetical trade by looking at the last trading day for each stock. We can see that stock A was unable to trade above the previous day’s high, either on an intraday or closing basis. Also, it traded in a narrow range and closed about where it opened, all signs that buyers lacked conviction. Looking closer, the %D line indicates stock A isn’t oversold, which is good. However, the two lines haven’t crossed—as you can see, %K is still below %D. If %K had crossed %D, that would show a little more upside strength. On a positive note, volume was relatively light: Heavy volume can be a danger sign when the stock moves in the opposite direction of the trend. The last trading day on stock B tells a different story. The stock not only traded above the previous day’s high during the course of the trading day, it also managed to close above it. Also, it had a wide-range day with a close near the top. These are all signs that the buyers have gained control and that the pullback could be over, especially since this price action occurred on the back of higher than average volume. Also, stochastics show that neither %K nor %D are oversold, indicating strength. In addition, %K has crossed %D, which is another bullish sign. In sum: Stock B looks like the stronger candidate. Simplify your stock selection Stock selection doesn’t have to be difficult, but you do need to be flexible. Look for markets that are moving, but also be willing not to trade. Consider going short, as well as long. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you need to be disciplined. Don’t let the inevitable bad trades turn into a disaster. Keep your losses small and live to trade another day.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'It seems like inflation worries are everywhere these days. Is it back? Is it coming? Will it last? How bad could it get? While investors of all types may care about inflation, the issue is particularly salient for those who have retired. Indeed, in a recent Society of Actuaries survey, retirees said their second-largest concern was the possibility their savings and investments won’t keep pace with inflation (not being able to afford a nursing home was number one). Here, we’ll take a closer look at inflation and some of the financial considerations particular to retired people. What’s happening Perhaps the first thing to acknowledge is that some inflation is actually good for the economy. When the prices of goods and services are allowed to increase at a slow and stable rate over time, businesses can invest in growth and innovation—reasonably secure in the knowledge that they can charge more tomorrow than they can today—while households can be confident that rising prices won’t blow a hole in the family budget and hinder saving. Over time, the Federal Reserve has determined that inflation of 2% is “most consistent” with its twin mandates of price stability and maximum employment. The trouble is, inflation has remained stubbornly below that level for nearly a decade, even as unemployment fell to a 50-year low in the months leading up to the pandemic. In response, the Fed has kept interest rates low, and even started buying bonds, both to inject more cash into the markets and keep longer-term rates down. More recently, the Fed also loosened up its targeting scheme for inflation, vowing to let price growth run a little above the 2% target before triggering an interest rate hike. So, in a sense, the recent uptick in inflation readings is a welcome sign, indicating that the Fed’s efforts have started to pay off. Government relief and stimulus spending have also helped. And then there’s the pandemic effect, which may temporarily be making the inflation situation seem worse than it is. Business closures and lockdowns put numerous kinks in supply chains, leading to bizarre price increases for certain materials, such as lumber. We also have “base effects,” which are unavoidable when you compare prices today—when the economy is recovering—to those a year ago—when it was struggling due to the pandemic. The same problem is showing up in gas prices, which are higher now that more people are driving (and Saudi Arabia and Russia have halted a price war that helped push prices down last year). As we move forward, those temporary effects should drop out of the data. The bottom line is that we’re pretty far from a return to the double-digit inflation rates of the 1970s, in our view. That said, even moderate inflation adds up over time. At an average growth rate of 2.5%, prices will double in less than 30 years. But is it worth panicking? Inflation in retirement Inflation isn’t a monolith, with one uniform rate. The cost of groceries might fall, while the cost of healthcare surges. Consequently, your experience with inflation will depend a lot on where your dollars go. “In general, four things come to dominate most retirees’ expenses: housing, transportation, food, and healthcare. So, it makes sense to track conditions in those categories,” says Rob Williams, vice president of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. In fact, the Labor Department maintains a special dataset called CPI-E(lderly) based on spending patterns for those aged 62 and older. “As of May, inflation in three of those categories remained relatively low overall,\" Rob says. “Given the sharp rise in transportation costs, retirees might want to approach their travel plans carefully right now.” Inflation rates in retirees’ top-four expenses in May Inflation rates in retirees\\' top-four expenses in May Category % of spending Annualized 1-Year Inflation Annualized 5-Year Inflation Housing 35.7% 2.9% 2.8% Health Care 14.0% 1.0% 2.3% Transportation 13.8% 18.3% 2.7% Food 13.1% 2.2% 1.9% Source SCFR calculations based on BLS data. CEX based on age 65+, 2019–20 mid-year data. “How you plan to spend your money also matters,” he adds. “Some retirees might spend more on travel and leisure in their early years, and then find those costs shrink even as they spend more on healthcare or long-term care later in life. Others might face high healthcare costs from the start.” “Differences in spending and the way inflation affects spending power over time are why it’s so important to make sure your portfolio is diversified in a way that helps to deliver stability and growth in retirement,” Rob says. “Your investments don’t stop growing the day you retire.” In fact, your savings may be better able to cope with inflation than you might expect. For example, stock returns hold up better against both inflation and taxes than bonds and cash investments.

Indices representing each asset class are the S&P 500® Index (stocks), Ibbotson Intermediate U.S. Government Bond Index (bonds), and Ibbotson U.S. 30-day Treasury bills (cash investments).

Indices are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. For additional information, please see Schwab.com/IndexDefinitions. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. And when inflation rises, interest rates should follow, so assets like newly issued Treasuries and bond funds should start paying higher interest rates over time. Social Security benefits may also rise with inflation. But that’s not all. Investing and spending Conventional investing wisdom includes two strategies that are relevant to how retirees think about inflation. The first is that, as you age, it’s best to scale back your riskier stock holdings in favor of more-stable bonds and cash investments. The second is the 4% rule for drawing down your savings: In your first year of retirement, you withdraw 4% of your portfolio and then adjust that amount in line with inflation each year thereafter. While both strategies are useful starting points, they may not be flexible enough for retirees dealing with the reality of shifting economic environments. Why? You may need to start retirement with a sizable allocation to stocks. It’s natural to want to reduce risk as you age, but it’s also important not to hobble your growth potential by dialing too far back on stocks too soon, especially given their relative resilience against inflation. “In fact, in their first decade of retirement, it may make sense for today’s retirees to keep as much as 60% of their investment assets in equities,” Rob says. “And that’s just for those who want to support their retirement spending. If you have other spending plans or wish to leave a legacy, you may want even more.” Here’s how an allocation focused just on retirement—no other goals—might look over time: This example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. You may be able to withdraw more of your savings than you’d expect. The 4% rule may be both too conservative for many retirees, and not flexible enough to change with the markets. In short, it assumes your expenses will always rise with inflation, that you’ll have only a 50% allocation to stocks, and that you’ll need your savings to last for 30 years. It also assumes that you won’t change your spending, even modestly, in a down market. The reality is that your expenses may vary, and your portfolio will likely have good years and not so good years. If inflation has you wondering if your current savings will go the distance, it may make sense to work with an advisor to review and adjust spending as your needs dictate and conditions allow. Otherwise, make sure to update your financial plan once a year, so you can feel confident your spending is appropriate given the performance of your investments and the broader economy. The idea is to remain flexible and scale back when necessary, while staying invested for growth even as you spend. Up to you Unfortunately, inflation isn’t one of those investing conundrums where a list of three easy actions can see you through. Your personal rate of inflation may be higher or lower than someone else’s—never mind the baseline rates the Fed watches—depending on your spending needs and goals. So, if all this talk about inflation has you concerned, it’s worth taking the time to stress test the assumptions behind your retirement plan and portfolio. You may find that your financial plan already has some robust inflation expectations built in. If not, work with an advisor to determine what could happen to your plan if inflation rises, and adjust if necessary. The economy is always shifting, and your plans might need to follow suit.'}],\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I’m getting close to retirement but worried because the market has been so volatile over the last several months. Would it be smarter to delay retirement a bit longer before beginning to draw from my accounts? —A Reader Dear Reader, This is such an important question because when and how we retire is one of the biggest financial—and personal—decisions we'll ever make. The short answer to your question about timing is that yes, working longer is just about always a financial plus for many reasons, and probably much more than most people realize. As you point out, market volatility can be especially unnerving for those who are close to or in retirement. In 2020 we saw some extreme ups and downs, primarily due to the pandemic. This is a clear illustration that we can make estimates but never predict the stock market, which is inherently volatile. Therefore, my thoughts about retirement timing this year are the same as they were last year or the year before that. We always have to bake the potential for volatility into our planning and investment choices. It’s also important to recognize that retirement doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing decision. With people living longer and having more lifestyle choices it can make sense to pursue a phased retirement, gradually working less over a number of years. Let’s take a look at why working longer, even part-time, can be a powerful way to improve your retirement prospects, regardless of current market activity. Working longer means more years to earn and fewer years to spend It really makes intuitive sense: assuming that your health is not adversely impacted by your job, you’ll have more financial stability the longer you keep working. For example, if you enter the workforce at age 20, retire at age 60 and live to 90, you’ll need to fund 30 years of retirement from 40 years of savings. But if you continue to work until age 70, you’ll have 50 years to build savings to support 20 years of retirement. Working longer can be much more powerful than saving more while working Beyond the obvious impact of shifting the ratio of work years to retirement years, a significant study from the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research has shown that delaying retirement by as little as three to six months can have the same positive economic impact on one’s retirement nest egg as saving an additional 1 percent for thirty years. And the later in your work life you decide to increase your savings, the less the benefit: working for just one additional month has the same financial power as saving an additional 1 percent for ten years. Now of course this doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t continue to save diligently for your retirement. It simply underlines the power of working longer. Working longer allows you to earn more Social Security benefits Social Security benefits are based on your highest 35 years of earnings. Therefore, if you’re earning more now than when you were younger, by working longer you can replace lower earning years. Of course, every person’s circumstances are different; to see how working longer can impact your benefit, check out your earnings record at ssa.gov. In addition, your Social Security benefit will increase if you postpone filing until you turn 70. Breaking this down, you’ll get an annual increase of roughly 6-7 percent for every year you postpone benefits from age 62 to what the Social Security Administration considers your ‘full retirement age’ (FRA which is generally age 67 depending on the year you were born). Your benefit will then continue to increase 8 percent a year up until age 70 (it never makes sense to delay beyond age 70). And finally, if you’re married, your decision to postpone retirement could help your spouse if they collect a Social Security benefit based on your work record. A spousal benefit is based on the amount you would receive at FRA (not increasing beyond that), but a survivor benefit is based on the amount you ultimately collect (increasing up to age 70). Working longer allows you to defer certain required minimum distributions Another less recognized benefit to working longer is that it may allow you to defer taking an annual required minimum distribution (RMD) from your company’s 401(k) or 403(b), provided you're still working for the same employer. (One exception is if you own 5 percent or more of the company sponsoring the plan; in that case, you must begin RMD’s by the age of 72.) Also note that The SECURE Act passed in 2020 made major changes to RMD rules. Be sure to check in with your financial advisor or accountant to make sure you’re in compliance. The penalty for being late is a stiff 50 percent! Working longer can improve your health and quality of life And now I’ve saved the best for last. Depending on your job, your life-style, and your retirement aspirations, working longer may have benefits that extend beyond the financial. After all, work is about more than money for many people. It can provide you with an expanded social circle as well as a greater sense of purpose. Of course, if your job is too physically or emotionally demanding, you may be wise to make a change sooner rather than later. But if you are still enjoying your work and feel that you are making a valued contribution, working a few years—or even a few months—longer can be a smart decision. Another great option may be a phased retirement, gradually reducing your work hours over a number of years. I have several colleagues who have done this with great success, finding a new work/life balance that allows them to maintain their professional lives (and income) at the same time that they enjoy new endeavors. Ultimately, there isn’t one ‘best’ way or time to retire. If you're able to, working even a bit longer can be a big financial boon, regardless of what the stock market is doing. But you need to be realistic in your planning. Talk to your financial and tax advisors to make sure you understand the financial implications. At the same time, it's equally important to examine what retirement will mean to you and your family on a personal level. This is a big decision, not to be taken lightly or made in haste.

       "   'content': 'What\\'s in your portfolio? Ideally, it contains an appropriate blend of investments from various asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and gold. Each of these plays a unique role in your portfolio, providing the potential for growth, income, relative stability, or inflation protection. By adjusting how much you own of each asset class, you can adjust the risk/reward potential in your portfolio to create a mix that suits your goals and time horizon. For example, if your investing goal is many years away, giving you room to handle temporary market swings (that is, you have enough risk capacity), and you can stomach those big moves (risk tolerance), your portfolio might be tilted toward growth assets, such as stocks. On the other hand, if you\\'ll need money from your portfolio soon, or you want less volatility in your portfolio, it might be tilted toward defensive assets, which could include cash, cash investments, and short-term U.S treasuries, which are typically less volatile than stocks and long-term bonds. Below is a brief overview of major asset classes and what they can bring to your portfolio. Although we\\'ve grouped them based on how they\\'re commonly used—for growth, defense, income, or inflation protection—keep in mind that most can fill multiple roles in a portfolio. Note that we\\'ve also ranked them according to their relative volatility as part of a broader portfolio, from the relatively riskier growth assets to defensive assets aimed at helping manage risk. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. For illustrative purposes only. Growth Investors typically depend on stocks for growth potential over the longer term. Historically, equities have delivered the highest returns—but with correspondingly higher risk of volatility and losses. U.S. large-company (or \"large-cap\") stocks are publicly traded shares issued by U.S.-based companies with a market capitalization value of more than $20 billion. Large-cap companies are generally found in the leading U.S. stock indexes, including the S&P 500® and Dow Jones Industrial Average. They tend to be relatively stable and liquid compared with other types of stocks. U.S. small-company (or \"small-cap\") stocks are shares issued by U.S.-based companies that have a relatively small market capitalization value; companies with a market cap of $2 billion or less are often considered small-caps. Small-cap stocks provide more potential room for growth than large caps, but with commensurately higher volatility. International developed large-company (or \"international developed large-cap\") stocks are issued by large-cap companies based in countries considered to be highly developed in terms of their economy and capital markets, such as Japan or Germany. They typically provide growth potential and diversification. International developed small-company (or \"international developed small-cap\") stocks are issued by small-cap companies in developed markets. They offer greater potential for growth than their large-cap counterparts. They also provide diversification in a portfolio that includes U.S. stocks, because the revenues of these companies tend to be tightly tied to their home countries. International emerging-market stocks offer higher growth potential than developed markets, because corporate revenues have the potential to grow faster when economic growth is higher. They also offer diversification, as international emerging markets can perform differently than developed markets. Growth and income High-dividend-paying stocks and yield-oriented securities can provide both growth and income, given their potential for both high returns and yield. However, they have various levels of risk, and some may experience significant price declines. Also, as noted above, international investments are subject to factors including currency fluctuations and political instability. U.S. high-dividend stocks are shares of U.S. companies that tend to distribute higher-than-average dividends to shareholders. They can provide both income and growth potential to a portfolio. International high-dividend stocks can provide income, growth, and diversification to a portfolio. U.S. real estate investment trusts (REITs) are publicly traded real-estate related securities. REITs typically invest in commercial properties, such as shopping centers and office buildings. They are required by the IRS to pay out at least 90% of their taxable income to unit holders each year, money that is often exempt from corporate income taxes. REITs can provide income potential, inflation protection, and diversification. International REITs are REITs in countries outside the U.S. They can provide inflation protection, income potential, and diversification. Master limited partnerships (MLPs) are publicly traded securities of partnerships that generate at least 90% of their income from activities related to real estate or the production of oil, natural gas, coal, and other commodities. MLPs offer a tax advantage to investors, as cash flows are not taxed at the company level. MLPs can provide income and growth potential. Income A broad array of fixed income investments can provide income. Having a steady stream of income in a portfolio—the kind that fixed-rate coupon payments can provide—can help stabilize a portfolio during a stock market downturn. However, income-oriented investments offer various levels of risk, and aren\\'t immune to sharp price declines. We\\'ve ranked them in order of relative level of income and potential volatility: Investment-grade municipal bonds are issued by cities, states, counties, and public-purpose entities like hospitals and airports. They generally have relatively high credit ratings and provide income that is typically exempt from federal taxes, making them particularly attractive to investors in high tax brackets who are investing in taxable accounts. U.S. securitized bonds include asset-backed securities (ABS), mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and commercial MBS. They are typically backed by hard assets or loans. U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds are debt securities issued by U.S. companies with relatively high credit ratings. They tend to offer higher yields than comparable-maturity U.S. Treasury bonds. U.S. high-yield corporate bonds, sometimes known as \"junk\" bonds, are issued by companies with lower credit ratings. Because these bonds are riskier, they typically offer higher yields than comparable investment-grade bonds. Bank loans are loans that banks make to commercial borrowers, which are then sold to investment vehicles like mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They typically pay a floating rate based on a short-term interest rate benchmark. Although many investors buy them for income, because of their floating rate they can also be used as a hedge against interest rate changes. Preferred stocks have characteristics of both stocks and bonds. They generally offer relatively high yields, which can add income potential to a portfolio. International emerging-market bonds are issued by governments and companies in emerging-market countries. They typically offer higher yields to compensate for risk factors such as political instability and currency fluctuations. They can be a source of income and diversification, and offer the potential for capital appreciation. Inflation Inflation protection can minimize the corrosive impact of inflation on the value of your investment, though it\\'s probably best to think of such investments as offering diversification against inflation, and not a guarantee to keep pace or to beat inflation over time. Inflation-protected bonds and commodities are two such investments. However, keep in mind that inflation-protected bonds could lose value if deflation were to occur, that commodity prices are often volatile, and that futures trading is risky and not suitable for all investors. U.S. inflation-protected bonds—called Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS—are used to protect against rising inflation. At maturity, TIPS pay either the inflation-adjusted principal or the original principal, whichever is higher. Commodities—such as energy, agriculture, industrial metals, and livestock—can provide both diversification and inflation protection to a portfolio. Investors typically don\\'t purchase the actual commodity, but invest in mutual funds or ETFs that buy and sell futures contracts, which are agreements to purchase a certain amount of a commodity at an agreed-upon price and date in the future. Defensive assets Defensive assets generally have low correlations—that is, they don\\'t move in tandem—with stocks. This means they tend to perform relatively well when the stock market is under pressure—but they may underperform when the stock market is rising. Note that while defensive assets can lessen the impact of volatility on a portfolio, the portfolio may still lose value. Also, international investments and commodities such as gold may be affected by currency fluctuations, geopolitical events, and other factors. Cash and cash investments can offer a high level of stability, as well as liquidity and flexibility when needed. Nominal returns also generally rise if interest rates and inflation increase. Cash includes money in bank checking accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs), which are all insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).1 Cash also includes money in brokerage accounts, which is protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC),2 and money in a purchased money fund,3 which isn\\'t insured, but may offer relatively higher yields than the other cash investments. U.S. Treasury securities including Treasury notes and bonds are considered a relatively safe, defensive asset class. Their timely payment of principal and interest is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, making them among the highest-credit-quality investments available. U.S. Treasuries with shorter maturities can be a useful investment for money that could be needed soon, and Treasuries with longer-maturities can provide diversification to stock investments. International developed-country bonds are often considered a defensive asset class that offers U.S.-based investors geographic and currency diversification benefits along with income potential. They can be more volatile, however, than cash, cash investments, and U.S. Treasuries. Gold and other precious metals can be used to help buffer a portfolio against inflation and stock market shocks. Historically, when concern about inflation, geopolitical unrest, or financial system stability is high, investors have tended to buy gold. While gold and precious metals may provide defensive attributes, their prices can be volatile, and we don\\'t suggest them for money that may be needed soon. 1Bank checking accounts, savings accounts, and CDs are insured by the FDIC against the loss of up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, based on account ownership type (e.g., joint accounts) if the FDIC-insured bank were to fail. 2Assets in a brokerage account are protected up to $500,000 per investor, including a maximum of $250,000 in cash, by SIPC, in the event a SIPC-member brokerage fails. 3An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, I’d like to extend a hearty congratulations to the latest graduates. There’s no doubt we’ve all weathered a tough year and a half. But now, as a new grad, you can prepare to strike out on your own. Maybe you’ve got your first “real” job, or your first apartment—or are still deciding what your next chapter will be. In any case, this is the perfect time to take some tried-and-true steps toward financial independence. You may have heard much of the following advice before, but it bears repeating—both as a call to action to young people and as a reminder to anyone at any age who aspires to financial freedom. Seven steps to financial independence Spend less than you earn. Overspending is super easy to do, especially with the ease of online purchases, credit cards and “buy now, pay later” offers as a constant temptation. Therefore, you have to draw a line between what you absolutely need and the nice-to-haves. The best way to do this is to create a budget listing essential expenses like housing, utilities, food, transportation, insurance and debt payments in one column and extras such as entertainment, dining out and vacations in another. A shortcut for budgeting is to use the 50/30/20 rule: This means targeting 50 percent of your income toward needs; 30 percent toward wants; and 20 percent toward savings. Have a saving mindset. For some people, saving comes naturally. Others almost have to trick themselves into doing it. One great tactic is to pay yourself first by setting up an automatic monthly transfer from your checking to your savings account. But whatever it takes, make it a habit. To keep you motivated, spell out your goals, periodically check your progress and make adjustments as needed. Create a rainy-day fund. Continuing the theme from point two, carve out a portion of your savings budget to build a separate emergency fund, aiming to have enough cash to cover three-to-six months’ essential expenses. If you’re just starting out, aim for $1,000-$2,000 and build from there. Why? Look no further than the pandemic when millions of Americans were caught with a drop in income and unexpected expenses. What would happen if you lost your job or were injured in an accident? How would you pay your bills? That’s why a rainy-day fund is essential, regardless of your age. Control debt—don’t let it control you. Credit cards can feel so freeing—but they can also lock you into spiraling and expensive debt. It’s fine to use credit cards for convenience, but only if you don’t charge more than you can really afford and can pay off in full every month. In addition, if you have student debt, stay on top of your loans. Consolidate if it makes sense, review your repayment options, and reach out to service providers if you’re struggling and are at risk for missing a payment. Get insured. You’ve heard it before, and you might have resisted it, but make sure you have health insurance. Whether through work or an individual policy through healthcare.gov, don’t take the risk of being uninsured. If you’re 26 or younger, you’re still able be included on a parent’s policy. Of course, if you have a car, you need automobile insurance. Renting? Look into a low-cost renters’ policy. A big part of being independent is being prepared. Think retirement starting now. It’s super easy to postpone saving for retirement when you’re young, but the sooner you get started, the less you’ll need to save. In your 20s, aim to save between 10-15 percent of your gross salary between what you and your employer are contributing. Wait until you’re in your 30s, and you’ll need to ramp that up to 15-20 percent. If your employer offers a 401(k) match, you should at the very least contribute enough to get the full amount. If you’re on your own, consider opening a traditional or Roth IRA. They each have different tax advantages that may make one a better choice depending on your situation. Roth accounts may be a good choice for a young person because, while you don’t get the tax advantage up front, withdrawals are tax-free after age 59½ when you’ll potentially be in a higher tax bracket. Invest. Saving is one thing, but investing is another—and I encourage you to start investing as soon as you’ve built up your rainy-day fund. Before you get started, think about your goals, time horizon and risk tolerance. This will help you develop an investment strategy and choose appropriate investments. Thankfully, it doesn’t take a lot of money these days to get started, especially if you use mutual funds, exchange traded funds, or fractional shares. Depending on how involved you want to be, you also might consider a robo advice service. If you’re still unsure, consider working with a financial advisor who can help you get started, diversify, and make adjustments to your financial plan as your goals and market conditions change. You don’t need a lot of money to get help. There’s more of course. However, if you take these seven steps now—and remain mindful about the way you spend and save—you’ll not only give yourself a good start, you’ll be on your way to lasting financial independence.

       "   'abstract': 'How to put a down payment on your family’s financial future using your advance child tax credit payments.',\n",
       "   'content': 'What would you do with a couple hundred extra dollars each month? Tens of millions of households are asking themselves that question this summer, thanks to a temporary tweak to the child tax credit included in the COVID-19 relief bill passed earlier this year. From July to December, the IRS will send eligible families monthly advances of up to $300 per child under the age of 6, and up to $250 per child ages 6 to 17, with the remainder available when people file their taxes. The actual amount will depend on household income. Normally, parents of dependent children can claim a tax credit of $2,000 per child when they file their taxes, with phaseouts starting at $400,000 for married filers and $200,000 for single filers. This year, they’ll receive half that amount in advance. Congress also added a kicker for married filers earning less than $150,000 (or $75,000 for single filers) by expanding the tax credit to $3,600 per child under 6, and $3,000 per child ages 6 to 17. That extra credit phases out by $50 for every $1,000 in income above those amounts. As things stand now, the advance payments will end in December, but some in Congress hope to extend the program, or even make it permanent. While these payments will be a lifeline to families still struggling to cover their day-to-day living expenses after the pandemic, many others may find themselves with extra money in hand each month. The challenge for them will be how to make the most of it. (If you don’t want to receive advance payments, you can opt out and wait until you file. More on that below.) “It’s summer, things are opening again, and here’s a couple hundred extra dollars in your bank account each month. What could be more tempting?” asks Hayden Adams, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “But consider this: That money could make a big difference to your family’s long-term finances. A little planning can help you avoid frittering it away.” With that in mind, here are some tips for how you could put this money to work for your family. Build an emergency fund Are you prepared for a potential disaster or emergency? We suggest having enough cash on hand to cover three to six months’ worth of essential expenses, saved in an account you can access immediately. The idea here is that if things go south, you can avoid taking on debt from high-interest credit cards or drawing down your retirement funds. Having emergency cash on hand also helps you avoid selling long-term investments at inopportune times in the market. Consider funding a 529 savings account Have you started saving for your child’s college years? A 529 plan is a state-sponsored program that allows parents, relatives, and friends to invest in a child’s (or any person’s) K-12 and college education. Earnings in a 529 plan grow federally tax-deferred, which means you don’t have to pay taxes on current investment income or capital gains, and you may even receive breaks on state taxes, as well, depending on which plan you choose. Even better, withdrawals are tax-free as long as you use the money to pay for qualified education expenses, which typically include tuition, books, school supplies, and room and board. “Every dollar saved is one your child won’t have to borrow,” says Hayden. “And some states even allow a tax deduction or a tax credit to boot.” Consider funding a health savings account Are you using a health savings account (HSA) to save for your family’s medical bills? HSAs are tax-advantaged savings and investment accounts available to those with high-deductible health plans.1 Contributions to HSAs are tax-deductible.2 Capital gains, dividends, and interest accumulate tax-free.3 And you pay no tax on withdrawals for qualified medical expenses, such as doctor visits, prescription medications, eye exams, and dental care (see IRS Publication 502 for a complete list of qualified expenses). If you use HSA funds for nonmedical expenses before age 65, you pay not only ordinary income tax but also a 20% penalty; however, if you use HSA funds for nonmedical expenses after age 65, you pay only ordinary income tax. In other words, you’d take no worse a tax hit than you would with an individual retirement account (IRA). Consider funding an ABLE account Do you have a child with special needs? So-called ABLE accounts are tax-advantaged savings accounts made available to people with disabilities. You can contribute up to $15,000 in post-tax dollars to a single ABLE account per year. Although contributions are not tax-deductible at the federal level, they may be at the state level. Any growth in such an account is exempt from federal taxes, so long as the money is used for qualified expenses, such as education, housing, and supplemental medical costs. Consider funding a custodial account Want to help your child save more for their future while investing less money? Investing early is a great way to tap the power of compound growth. One way to do this is through a custodial account—an investment account that you set up and manage on behalf of your child until he or she reaches adulthood (typically 18, 21, or 25 years depending on your state). At that point, the money automatically becomes his or hers. You can make withdrawals at any time without penalty, as long as the money benefits the beneficiary (your child), and there are no lifetime limits on contributions. Anyone (parents, grandparents, other relatives and friends) can make unlimited contributions to a custodial account once it’s open. However, a person can’t contribute more than $15,000 per year ($30,000 for a married couple) in 2021 without triggering the gift tax. Income-tax wise, you’re exempt from taxes on the first $1,100 of earnings per year. The next $1,100 to $2,200 is taxed at the child’s rate (often 10 percent—the lowest income tax bracket). Anything over $2,200 is taxed at your income tax rate. Consider funding a Roth IRA for your child Does your child have a summer job? If they have earned income this year, you can open a tax-advantaged custodial Roth IRA account on their behalf, and help them make what could be a down payment on an early retirement. As with a custodial account, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but with a Roth IRA, contributions and earnings then grow tax-free—and you can withdraw them tax- and penalty-free after age 59½, assuming the account has been open for five years. You can contribute up to $6,000 in 2021, or the total of earned income for the year, whichever is less. “You could offer to use the child tax credit funds to match any contributions your child makes, or even just put them in as a gift,” says Hayden. “Investing in a Roth IRA when you’re young and likely to have a very low tax rate means you can put more money to work for a much longer time.” “Your child may laugh at the idea of saving for retirement during their teenage years,” he adds. “But imagine how happy they’ll be knowing they have a pot of tax-free withdrawals waiting for them when they’re older.” Use it as a stepping stone The expanded child tax credit may not be around forever, and you shouldn’t count on Congress expanding it beyond this year. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t build on it in the future. You could think of these payments as seed capital for a lifetime investing project. For example, if you have two children over the age of six, you could plan to invest your extra $500 a month while the program lasts, and then invest more modest sums on your own in the years ahead. Use this money to get started—and then make it a habit. What if you don’t want cash payments? The IRS has set up a portal where you can opt out of these payments if you think they aren’t for you—say, if they would disrupt your tax plans, or you have eligibility concerns. For example, if your tax plans for 2021 already assume you’ll receive a regular tax credit when you file next year, you may not want to receive any money in advance, as that could mean a smaller refund or even having to pay the IRS. Finally, as noted above, if your income increased this year and would render you ineligible for any child tax credit, you should consider opting out so you don’t end up having to pay it back at tax time.

       "   'abstract': 'Using S&P 500® put options for adding downside protection for your entire portfolio.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Hedging strategies are designed to reduce the impact of short-term corrections in asset prices. For example, if you wanted to hedge a long stock position, you could buy a put option or establish a collar on that stock. One challenge is that such strategies work for single stock positions. But what if you\\'re trying to reduce the risk of an entire portfolio? A well-diversified portfolio generally consists of multiple asset classes with many positions. If you wanted to hedge the equity portion of your portfolio, you\\'d have to hedge every equity position—which would be extremely costly. Here, we\\'ll look at how to deploy a portfolio hedge with a focus on S&P 500® Index ($SPX) put options. It\\'s important to understand that portfolio hedging is a fairly advanced topic, so investors considering this strategy should have experience using options and be familiar with the trade-offs they involve. How do you value a hedge? Effectiveness and cost are the two most important considerations when setting up a hedge. A portfolio hedge would be considered effective if its value holds relatively steady in the face of dropping asset prices. If we\\'re trying to hedge an equity portfolio against a market sell-off, we would expect the hedge to appreciate in value so that it offsets the drop in equity prices. As for cost, how much would you be willing to pay to hedge your entire portfolio for a certain period of time? That may depend on what you think the market might do in the near future. For example, if you strongly believe the stock market will fall 5%–8% over the next three months, an effective hedging strategy that costs less than 5% of your total portfolio\\'s value may be worth consideration. Why are S&P 500 put options a good choice? Finding a single financial product to hedge your entire portfolio in all its uniqueness could be a challenge. But if you have a well-diversified equity portfolio, S&P 500 ($SPX) put options could do the job. Options on the S&P 500 Index are considered \"1256 contracts\" under tax law and offer the following benefits: Favorable tax treatment: Many broad-based index options qualify for 60% long-term/40% short-term capital gains treatment—meaning 60% of your gains are taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rate, while just 40% is taxed as regular income. Other broad-based index options that qualify include those that overlay the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJX), Russell 2000 Index ($RUT), and NASDAQ 100 ($NDX). Cash settlement: All index options are cash settled, which makes the position easier to manage around expiration. Leverage: $SPX put options have a 100 multiplier, which provides the potential to offset a substantial decline in the portfolio for a relatively small upfront cost.1 How do you construct a portfolio hedge? Let\\'s say you own a $1,000,000 equity portfolio that is highly correlated with the S&P 500 index (assume the beta of the portfolio is 1.0), and you\\'re concerned that the S&P 500 may sell off substantially over the next three months. Now assume you\\'re willing to spend approximately 3% of the total portfolio value—or ~$30,000—to hedge your portfolio over that time (more on this below). If the SPX is at 4,200 and the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)—the average implied volatility of SPX options—is at ~16, then the cost of one SPX 4,200 put option that expires in approximately three months would be $11,500 ($115 ask price x 100). For this example, we\\'re using the at-the-money strike price to obtain immediate downside protection in the event of a sell-off. With the ~3% you\\'ve allocated for hedging, you could buy three SPX 4,200-strike put options for $34,500: $115 (ask) x 3 (# of contracts) x 100 (option multiplier) = $34,500 (excluding commissions). Each SPX 4,200 put contract has a nominal value of $420,000 (4,200 x 100 multiplier), so in order to establish a hedge that covers at least $1 million, we would need to purchase three of these contracts: $420,000 (nominal value) x 3 (# of contracts) = $1,260,000. The table below shows how hedging would affect your portfolio value upon the expiration of the three-month SPX put options.

As you can see in the example above, not only did the hedged portfolio maintain its value during the various SPX sell-off scenarios, but it actually resulted in a net profit for the overall portfolio in the –15% and –20% scenarios. The net positive change in the hedged portfolio during those scenarios was primarily due to the higher nominal value of the three put contracts discussed above. Additional considerations: The perfect hedge doesn\\'t exist, and there\\'s no guarantee that the hedge will perform as planned. Be aware that the effectiveness of hedging your portfolio hinges on its correlation to the S&P 500 index with a beta of 1.0. The above example assumes that the SPX puts are held until expiration (approximately three months), but keep in mind that you can generally sell the puts before they expire if you believe the hedge is no longer necessary. If you do so, you\\'ll likely capture some of the time value remaining in the puts, which would lower the initial 3% hedging cost. If the VIX\\'s level had been higher, the cost to hedge would\\'ve been more expensive, given that hedging costs rise in line with increased volatility expectations. Therefore, if you wait for the market to sell-off, there\\'s a high probability that the VIX will move above 16. This would cause three-month at-the-money options to be more expensive, resulting in higher put prices and making the equivalent hedging strategy cost more than ~3%. The converse is also true: If the VIX had been below 16, the equivalent hedge would\\'ve cost less than 3%. Is it worth it? The hedging strategy presented above provides an efficient way to hedge an entire portfolio, but is the cost worth the benefit? Some investors may take comfort in knowing that the \"worst-case scenario\" for their portfolio is being down ~3% for the next three months. Others may feel that establishing a short-term hedge is equivalent to timing the market and, therefore, may elect to focus on the long term. Regardless of your opinion, understand that any portfolio protection, or hedging strategy, comes at a cost. Whether it\\'s worth it or not depends on your view regarding how far and how fast the market could fall and if you would be able to ride out a severe decline. 1With long options, investors may lose 100% of funds invested.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Trying to choose between a traditional individual retirement account (IRA) and a Roth IRA? They both offer tax-advantaged ways to save for retirement, so your decision may come down to a simple-seeming question: What flavor of tax advantage would you prefer? Does it make more sense to put off paying taxes on your savings until you retire, or should you just get it over with and pay today so you don't have to do so later? To be clear, this oversimplifies things quite a bit—these accounts come with various eligibility rules and contribution limits that could affect your choice—but doing some basic tax planning should get you in the right head space for making a final call. Read on to learn more about these popular savings vehicles. What’s the difference between a traditional and Roth IRA? A traditional IRA is an individual retirement account that allows you to make contributions on a pre-tax basis (if your income is below a certain level) and pay no taxes until you withdraw the money. Starting at age 72, you’ll have to start taking mandated annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your traditional IRA. Those withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income; however, if you withdraw the money before age 59½, you may also be subject to a 10% early-withdrawal penalty and state-tax penalties. In contrast, Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars. You can withdraw contributions to a Roth account anytime, tax- and penalty-free, and can withdraw your earnings tax-free after age 59½ if you’ve had the account for at least five years, or you meet certain other conditions.1 If you make an early withdrawal of any earnings, you must pay taxes and penalties on them. There are no annual RMDs with Roth IRAs. How much can I contribute? The maximum amount you can contribute across all your IRAs (traditional or Roth) in 2021 is $6,000—or $7,000 if you’re age 50 or older. However, some rules affect IRA contributions and deductibility. To start, if neither you nor your spouse is offered a retirement plan by an employer, there’s no income limit for contributing to a traditional IRA, and your contribution is fully deductible. However, if either of you participates in a workplace retirement plan, deductibility phases out depending on your filing status and income. With Roth IRAs, you can only contribute if your income meets certain limits.2 If you qualify for both accounts, how do you choose which one to contribute to? A general guideline is that if you think your tax bracket will be higher when you retire than it is today, you may want to consider a Roth IRA—especially if you’re younger and have yet to reach your peak earning years. Conversely, if you think you’ll be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, a traditional IRA can be an attractive option; you get the tax benefits when you’re in a relatively high tax bracket and can make your withdrawals when you’re potentially in a lower bracket. If you think your tax bracket will be the same when you retire, it’s almost a wash for income tax purposes. What are the advantages of a Roth IRA? A Roth IRA can offer flexibility to manage your taxes and spending in retirement because you can withdraw money without increasing your tax bill—which could come in handy if, for example, you have a large, one-time expense after you’ve retired. Roth IRAs let you withdraw contributions anytime for any reason without tax or penalty—but just because you can doesn’t mean you should, particularly if you’re fairly young. Taking money out of your Roth IRA means you may miss out on the potential for compounding gains for retirement. And when you can put in only $6,000 for 2021 plus an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you’re age 50 or older, it might be difficult to make up the amount you withdraw. Finally, we can’t know future tax rates with certainty. Contributing part of your retirement savings dollars to a Roth IRA after paying taxes can add tax diversification to your retirement savings in the event Congress increases tax rates in the future or when you retire. Other things to keep in mind Account rollovers If you change jobs, you have the option to convert a traditional 401(k) directly into a Roth IRA without having to roll it into a traditional IRA first. Just remember, you must pay federal income tax on the full amount at the time of the rollover. Also, you may have other options, including keeping your assets in your former employer’s plan, rolling over assets to your new employer’s plan, rolling over assets to a new traditional IRA, or taking a cash distribution (on which taxes and possible withdrawal penalties may apply). Roth 401(k) An increasing number of employers offer Roth 401(k) options in addition to traditional 401(k)s. With a Roth 401(k), you can contribute a portion or all of your paycheck up to certain limits. You can also choose to have some of your paycheck go pre-tax into a traditional 401(k) and some post-tax into a Roth 401(k). Any employer match or contribution, however, must go into a traditional 401(k). Unlike with a Roth IRA, contributions to a Roth 401(k) are not subject to earnings limits. This means that if you aren’t eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA because your income is too high, you may be able to contribute to a Roth 401(k). You can also contribute more to a Roth 401(k) (up to $19,500 with a $6,500 catch-up contribution) than you can a Roth IRA. Distributions from a Roth 401(k) are subject to the same general tax rules as a Roth IRA, with the exception of an RMD requirement. You can avoid the RMD by rolling over a Roth 401(k) balance into a Roth IRA after you retire but before your RMD age. If you’re eligible, don’t forget the Roth 401(k) option if a Roth makes sense for you. Roth IRA conversions If you’re ineligible for a Roth IRA because of income limits, some investors choose to make contributions to a traditional IRA and then later convert those contributions to a Roth IRA. High earners who aren’t eligible to make Roth IRA contributions could make nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA and then convert to a Roth (sometimes called a “backdoor Roth conversion”). However, there are some caveats. You can’t pick and choose which portion of traditional IRA money is converted. The IRS looks at all earnings from traditional IRAs as one when it comes to distributions, including funds from Roth conversions. Traditional IRA balances are aggregated so that the amount converted consists of a prorated portion of taxable and nontaxable money. So, making nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA with the goal of later converting to a Roth IRA would likely work best if you have little or no existing deductible IRA balance to muddy the waters. Still, any earnings leading up to conversion would be subject to income tax. We generally suggest that the tax be paid with other funds, not withdrawals from the IRA, to maximize the amount available to convert and contribute to the Roth account. The bottom line Both traditional and Roth IRAs are great long-term savings tools, so educate yourself on the differences and make an informed decision that fits your retirement goals. If you expect tax rates in the future will rise, either because your wealth and income will be higher when you retire or a change in tax law, consider Roth accounts. Also, be sure to talk with your CPA or tax professional about whether a traditional or a Roth IRA—or both—makes sense for you. ¹If you take a distribution of Roth IRA earnings before you reach age 59½ and before the account is 5 years old, the earnings may be subject to taxes and penalties. You may be able to avoid penalties (but not taxes) in certain situations. If you’re older than 59½ but haven’t met the five-year holding requirement, your earnings may be subject to taxes but not penalties. Consult IRS rules before contributing to or withdrawing money from a Roth IRA. 2https://www.schwab.com/ira/roth-ira/contribution-limits\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'How to trade while on vacation.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Some of us may once again be contemplating a key question: When does vacation start? For many stock traders, answering it could prove surprisingly challenging. While the pandemic has been no one’s idea of fun, it has left stock traders with plenty of time to monitor their portfolios. One study found a pretty significant uptick in trading activity after the pandemic started, with more people opening new brokerage accounts and established traders entering more positions than usual.1 Now that vacations are slowly returning, though, traders who wiled away their lockdown days poring over stock charts may find it’s not so easy to look away, no matter how badly they need a break. That’s not to say relaxation and returns are mutually exclusive. But it does make sense to really think about your trading before you suddenly find yourself off the grid for a couple days. So, before you head out, think through the following four questions to help decide whether—and how—to trade on your next vacation, whenever it may be. 1. What kind of trader are you? First off, consider your time horizon. If you’re a short-term trader accustomed to buying and selling positions within a single day, you might want to just disconnect. After all, you’ll have time for little else if you’re constantly monitoring the market for profit opportunities. It’s a different story for swing and intermediate-term traders, who hold positions from a couple of days to several months, respectively. The question isn’t whether to obsessively monitor your positions but rather which order types you can use to protect your positions while you’re away. The key is to add some built-in protection, so be sure to place bracket orders—identifying your stop and profit prices—on every open position before you leave. This can help limit your losses if the market moves against you, or lock in your desired profit if things go as you hope. 2. How much time will you realistically have to trade? If the answer is none, you should close out your positions before heading out, particularly if you’ll be away for a while. Otherwise, you should be able to keep them open, with a bracket order in place, even if you have only a few minutes to check on them each day. If that’s the case, here’s how to make the most of your limited time online: Each day, either after the market closes or before it opens for trading, briefly scan the news to see how the market is shaping up and if there are any developments that might change your views on your existing holdings. If your views have changed, consider altering your bracket order to align with your new thinking. You could also add a position, assuming you’ve done your homework and the price is right. For the latter, use a conditional order—one that triggers a purchase only if certain conditions are met—and even then, place a bracket order to protect your downside and lock in your upside. 3. How connected will you be? Traveling can mean hours or even days without a reliable internet connection. Roughing it on a weeklong camping trip is a grand adventure—but it’s not great for trading. Neither is a Paris apartment that promises speedy Wi-Fi but fails to deliver. If you suspect your internet access may be unreliable, set up email or text alerts so you’ll be notified via cellular service if certain market conditions are met. You can do this not only for price and volume changes but also stop losses, margin warnings, and bid and ask prices. You can even set expiration dates for each alert to keep intrusions to a minimum (see “Alerts on the go,” below). Of course, if you think there’s a chance your internet access may be compromised completely, you might want to play it safe and close out your positions ahead of time. 4. How has your trading performance been? Let’s face it: We all go through rough patches. Emotion can get the best of us when losses start to pile up, leading to some less-than-optimal decisions. At times like these, the best course of action may be to take a mental break—and there’s no better time for doing so than a holiday. Even if your trading portfolio has been performing well, it can help to step away from the screen. We’ve all felt the push and pull of watching market prices move minute by minute, and sometimes the best way to enforce discipline is to hang back and let your automatic orders mind the store. The time away might also give you a chance to reflect on your performance. The storied investor Jesse Livermore, for example, made a point of locking himself in a Chase Manhattan bank vault the last weekend of every year to analyze all the trades he’d made over the previous 12 months. Nobody’s suggesting you spend your hard-earned vacation inside a bank vault, but a little self-reflection without the day-to-day distractions of the market can help recharge your batteries for when you do return to trading. 1Regina Ortmann, Matthias Pelster, and Sascha Tobias Wengerek, “COVID-19 and investor behavior,” Elsevier Public Health Emergency Collection, 08/08/2020.

       "   'abstract': 'Teachers may have access to a number of unique and valuable benefits to help secure their financial future.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I’ve been a public-school teacher for five years. I love my job and the kids but I’m really concerned about money, especially saving for retirement. Any special advice you can give teachers? —A Reader Dear Reader, It’s great to hear that you love your job. Certainly no one goes into teaching to get rich, and yet I can’t imagine a more important and rewarding profession. I’m also glad you’re starting to think about your future so early in your career because this is the perfect time to put your finances on the right path. As a teacher, you may have access to a number of unique and valuable benefits that aren’t available to workers in the private sector and it’s important to maximize them all. Here’s a quick overview of the steps you can start to take now to help secure your financial future, including retirement. 1. Start with a clear assessment of where you are today Before you do anything else, figure out your current net worth. This simply means adding up what you own (your assets) and subtracting what you owe (your liabilities). Next, write down all your expenses and sources of income. The result is a financial snapshot of your current situation—and will be the benchmark you can use to measure your progress over time. 2. Set your goals Next, spell out your goals. Perhaps you want to buy a house or save up for graduate school in five years. If you're carrying consumer debt, make paying that off an important goal. This will allow you to make retirement a high priority. Goals often change over time, but writing them down now will help you focus on your priorities and save and invest accordingly. 3. Amp up your income Your salary is probably tied to a set schedule, but can you accelerate it by taking additional courses or getting special certifications? Do you speak a second language? Have a unique skill or credential? These can all bump you to a new salary level. Also think about side jobs such as tutoring—during the school year as well as over the summer. This can be a great way to raise extra cash for retirement or other goals. 4. Make a budget… for the entire year When it comes to budgeting, I like the 50/30/20 rule: 50 percent of your income toward needs; 30 percent towards wants; 20 percent towards savings. If you’re not able to put a full 20 percent to savings now, start with a smaller amount and increase it every year as your salary increases. And remember, whether you’re paid on a 10- or 12-month schedule, it’s necessary to budget with an eye to the entire year. After all, there’s no summer vacation when it comes to bills. 5. Build your emergency fund Going back to savings, try to have a minimum of enough cash to cover three to six months of essential expenses—things like food, rent, and utilities as well as financial surprises like a car repair or needing a plumber. Keep this money in a stable account like a savings account, where it's easily accessible. If you don’t have that much saved now, make it one of your top priorities. 6. Get the right insurance Teachers often have access to insurance benefits as part of their total compensation, so take the time to carefully review all your options. Start with health insurance and consider the tradeoffs between costs and coverage. If you’re eligible, a health savings account can be a great way not only to save for future heath expenses, but also to supplement your tax-sheltered savings. And don't forget about life and disability policies. You probably have some basic coverage, but you may need to supplement it with individual policies. 7. Explore help with student loans Under the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program, if you teach in a low-income school or educational service agency and meet other qualifications, you may be eligible for forgiveness of some of your federal student loans. As a government employee, you may be eligible for public service loan forgiveness (PSLF)—another potential benefit you don’t want to overlook. This PSLF Help Tool can guide you through eligibility criteria and actions you need to take. 8. Don’t just save, also invest Saving money for emergencies is essential, but when you’re setting aside money for longer-term goals it’s important to switch gears from being a saver to an investor. Investing puts your savings to work—so you don’t have to. If you’re new to investing, take some time to educate yourself about the tradeoffs between risk and reward and the importance of diversification. While stocks have historically performed better than cash or bonds over long periods of time, because of their volatility they’re generally only appropriate if you have a timeframe of five or more years. 9. Start saving for retirement NOW Depending on your state and district, you may have access to a traditional pension plan. These days a pension is a relatively rare benefit (about 86 percent of state and local public sector workers have one as compared to 15 percent of private sector workers). If you’re among this group, understand the vesting rules and find out how much you'll likely receive on an annual basis—as you may still need to supplement it with other savings and income. If you’re not contributing to Social Security through your teaching job, understand how any Social Security benefits you might have from another job or even a spouse’s work history might be reduced. As a teacher, you may have access to a 403(b) or 457(b) plan. Similar to 401(k)s, they are powerful tax-advantaged retirement accounts, and can be either pre-tax or after-tax (Roth). Be sure you fully understand your investment choices, contribution limits and the rules for taxes and required minimum distributions. 403bwise is a great resource to learn more. And finally, consider contributing to an IRA to amp up your retirement savings even more. 10. Create a financial plan My final thought is to encourage you to work with a financial planner to create a comprehensive financial plan. Many people believe financial plans are only for the wealthy. Quite the contrary. This checklist includes top-line advice—but when it’s time to dig into all the particulars of your life and put the pieces together, there's no substitute for a professional financial plan, which can be low-cost or even complimentary. As a mother of three, I have a deep sense of gratitude and respect for teachers. You're part of a profession that cares for others, but it's my job to tell you to also look out for your own best interests. Do your financial homework. Pay attention to your benefits as well as your salary. Create a financial plan. That way, you’ll be able to thrive as an educator, focusing on the job you love. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'Moving to a smaller house can have many financial advantages. Here’s what you should consider from a tax perspective.',\n",
       "   'content': 'You may be at the stage in life where your kids are out of the house—or perhaps you\\'re just looking for a change—and want to downsize your home. There\\'s no question that downsizing can have many financial advantages. A smaller house can mean less upkeep, lower monthly expenses—and maybe even potential cash from a sale. But before making a decision, it\\'s important to assess how taxes could play a part. Will selling your home be worth it if it comes with a big tax bill? Under current law, if you sell your principal residence for a profit, you may qualify to exclude up to $250,000 ($500,000 for married couples filing jointly) of that capital gain from your income tax.1 While many people may not profit enough to have to pay capital gains tax at all, those whose homes have appreciated considerably could face a significant bill. First, the basics In order to claim the maximum exclusion, you\\'ll need to pass what the IRS calls the ownership and use tests. This means: You must have owned the house for at least two years. And you must have lived in the house as your principal residence for two out of the last five years, ending on the date of the sale. There are exceptions to these rules—for example, moving before owning the home for two years due to a job change or experiencing what the IRS designates an \"unforeseen circumstance,\" such as a divorce or natural disaster. In such cases, the IRS will allow you to prorate the exclusion. One thing to note: if you go through a divorce after having lived in the home for just one year, you would be entitled to only 50% of the exclusion. Additionally, the two years of residency don\\'t have to be consecutive so long as you\\'ve lived in your home for a total of 24 months out of the five years prior to the sale. You\\'re also able to claim this exclusion on multiple sales, but you can only claim this exclusion once every two years. Calculate your cost basis To determine capital gains on the sale of your home, subtract your cost basis from the selling price. But what exactly is your cost basis? Your cost basis is not just the purchase price. It can include certain settlement fees, closing costs, and commissions associated with both the purchase and the sale—excluding escrow amounts related to taxes and insurance, etc.2 Add to this the cost of significant capital improvements (but not repairs) you made over time for renovations, additions, roofing, landscaping, and other upgrades. All of these improvements will increase your cost basis and, therefore, lower your potential tax liability. Hopefully, you\\'ve kept good records because this can add up. On the other side of the equation, there are a few things that can reduce your cost basis, increasing not just your profit but potentially your taxes as well. For example, if you received tax credits for energy-related improvements, you will have to subtract those amounts from your cost basis. Also, if you ever claimed depreciation for a home office, you may have to \"recapture\" and pay tax on that amount. Capital improvement or repair? Tax rules let you add the cost of a capital improvement to your cost basis but not the cost of a repair. The difference? A capital improvement increases the value of your property. A repair simply restores your property to its original condition. A new deck is a capital improvement. Fixing your plumbing is a repair. Sometimes, though, the distinction is less clear. For example, if you replace your entire roof, that\\'s a capital improvement. But if you simply replace a few shingles, that\\'s a repair. A sample tax bill Jon and Jane bought their home in 1988 for $250,000. Now in their mid-60s, they\\'ve decided to downsize. They sell their home for $875,000. Over the years, Jon and Jane did a lot of remodeling and made many home improvements. Because Jane has a home office, they\\'ve claimed depreciation on their income tax return, which now has to be subtracted from the cost basis. They are in the 32% tax bracket and pay a 15% long-term capital gains tax rate. Here are the numbers. What did they spend? When Jon and Jane bought their home, they paid $12,500 in allowable settlement fees and closing costs at the time of purchase, and over the years, they spent $50,000 remodeling their kitchen and master bath, $20,000 on a new roof, and $15,000 on new landscaping—a total of $347,500. Because they had to recapture $50,000 of depreciation costs for Jane\\'s office, the total cost basis of their home is $297,500. What did they sell it for? Jon and Jane sell their house for $875,000, but the $55,000 in commission and sales fees reduces their gross profit to $820,000. How much did they make? After subtracting their cost basis of $297,500 from their gross profit of $820,000, Jon and Jane will earn $522,500 in capital gains. How much do they owe in capital gain taxes? Because Jon and Jane are filing jointly, they can exclude the up to $500,000 of their capital gains, leaving them with a taxable gain of $22,500. Based on their income, their capital gains tax rate is 15%, resulting in a capital gains tax bill of $3,375. Note: Jon and Jane must also \"recapture\" the $50,000 of home office depreciation deductions on their tax return as a \"unrecaptured section 1250 gain.\" In this example it will be taxed at the maximum rate of 25% ($12,500 in tax). They would have to do this even if their capital gain was less than their $500,000 exclusion. Looking ahead: Rent or buy? Downsizing may mean buying a smaller house or moving to a less expensive area. Alternatively, you could decide that it would make more sense to rent. On the plus side, renting releases you from worry about things like property taxes and upkeep—potentially giving you more freedom both economically and emotionally. If you don\\'t deposit money into another house, it could also give you a nice retirement nest egg. On the minus side, if you rent, you won\\'t be building equity, and you\\'ll be subject to the whims of a landlord. There\\'s no right or wrong answer. A lot will depend on where you live and how long you plan to stay in your next home. In either case, if you make a considerable profit on the sale of your home, talk to your financial advisor about the best way to invest this money in light of your overall financial situation. 1IRS Publication 523. 2Ibid.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Divorce after 50—the rate of which has doubled since 19901—can have an outsize impact on your financial security. Indeed, parting ways with your spouse can potentially halve your assets while doubling your expenses, which can be especially detrimental when you don’t have decades to regroup and rebuild. “After a long marriage, there’s a greater likelihood that much of a couple’s wealth resides in assets acquired together over the years,” says Bob Barth, a Schwab wealth strategist based in Orlando, Florida. How those assets will be divided varies considerably depending on where you live. For example, in the nine community property states—Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin—all earnings and everything acquired with those earnings during the marriage are generally divided 50/50. In common law states, on the other hand, marital assets should be divided “equitably,” a standard that gives courts considerable discretion in deciding what’s fair. Even assets that are understood to be separate—such as certain types of inheritances (see “Whose inheritance is it, anyway?” below)—may still figure into how a court decides who gets what. “You’ll want the help of your financial advisor, an accountant, and a lawyer well-versed in state-specific rules,” Bob says. “Divorce is complicated, and there are a lot of different ways you can approach it.” In addition, these rules are constantly evolving in the law. For older couples, sources of retirement savings can loom especially large—because of both their size and how soon you’re likely to need them. What’s more, such assets often are governed by their own rules regarding how they can be divvied up. With that in mind, let’s look at three assets of special relevance to later-in-life divorce. 1. Retirement accounts By law, 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) can have only a sole account holder. However, the money that goes into such accounts during a marriage technically belongs to both parties. As part of the divorce settlement, the spouse with a higher balance may need to transfer funds to the other spouse’s account. In the case of 401(k) funds, both spouses need to file a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) with a state-level domestic-relations court to spell out how they want the money divided. Each spouse should keep these three things in mind: The most tax-efficient method for the receiving spouse is to roll such funds directly into their own retirement account. The receiving spouse can also qualify to have some 401(k) funds distributed directly for immediate expenses. (Such distributions are exempt from the 10% early withdrawal penalty for those younger than 59½, though the receiving spouse would still be subject to 20% withholding for federal taxes, plus any applicable state taxes.) Any funds transferred directly to the receiving spouse cannot later be deposited into that spouse’s IRA, and any rollover to an IRA must occur within 60 days of the receipt of the money, otherwise, the IRS will consider the funds taxable income (minus the 20% withholding). QDROs don’t apply to IRA assets. However, a direct rollover from one spouse’s IRA to another spouse’s IRA—again, the most tax-efficient method—can occur only if outlined in the divorce settlement and filed with the plan custodian. Alternatively, account holders worried about jeopardizing their retirement savings might instead be able to relinquish other assets—a greater stake in the equity of a home or the contents of an investment account, for example—to satisfy their financial obligations to the other spouse. “Either way, states have a vested interest in seeing that no one comes out of a divorce facing unnecessary financial strain,” Bob says. “So, when a married couple has saved successfully for retirement, those funds are generally used to ensure that both parties end up financially secure.” 2. Pensions The court typically considers a defined-benefit pension that one spouse earned during the marriage as a shared asset, too. “This can become an emotional issue,” Bob cautions. “If one spouse has put in the time to earn a pension, he or she may feel territorial about it.” As with a 401(k) or an IRA, a qualifying spouse would be entitled to only that portion of the pension earned during the marriage. However, pension plan rules, state laws, and whether a spouse has already begun receiving payments can make divvying up pension assets more complicated than parsing retirement accounts. If only one spouse has a pension, he or she may wish to offer up other assets of equal value rather than haggle over the pension itself. When both spouses have a pension but they’re of unequal value, the spouse with the larger pension might make up the difference by purchasing a single premium life insurance policy and naming their former spouse as the beneficiary rather than forfeit a portion of his or her pension. “In both cases, you’re offsetting the amount your ex would have received from your pension with something of equal value,” Bob says. 3. Social Security In contrast to retirement accounts and pensions, which may be subject to a lot of wrangling and compromise, the handling of Social Security benefits in divorce is controlled by law and is rarely open to interpretation. “The Social Security benefit is what it is—though keep in mind it may become part of the larger discussion around who gets what, which can itself be contentious,” Bob says. If the couple was married for at least 10 years before splitting, the ex-spouse will be eligible to apply for monthly benefits worth up to 50% of the higher earner’s full retirement-age benefit. (If the lower earner remarries, however, he or she forgoes any claim to such benefits in most cases.) This ex-spousal benefit in no way affects the benefit of the higher-earning spouse—no matter how many times he or she has been married and divorced. “In that respect, this is a rare win-win—an ex-spousal benefit that costs absolutely nothing for the spouse on whom it depends,” Bob says. Moving forward Once your divorce is final, you should consider how your new situation impacts your current and future finances. Toward that end, revisit your financial plan to ensure you’re still on track to reach your goals. You should also update your will and account beneficiaries with your new situation in mind. “Make sure you update your beneficiary designations, in particular, as soon as your divorce is finalized,” Bob says. “If you don’t, you run the risk of leaving additional assets to your ex, as some states don’t automatically nullify such designations after divorce.” The truth is, most people don’t plan for divorce—especially relatively late in life. But working with a financial advisor before, during, and after your split can help both parties get back on track as quickly as possible. “If you find yourself facing divorce and retirement,” Bob says, “there are definitely concrete steps you can take to limit the impact on your future.” Whose inheritance is it, anyway? How to handle an inheritance can be a gray area in a gray divorce. Even if you live in one of the nine community property states mentioned above, receiving an inheritance during the course of your marriage doesn’t necessarily mean your spouse is entitled to a portion of its value. If inherited money was specifically bequeathed to one spouse and was never commingled with shared funds, for example, the court might treat it as a separate asset in a divorce. Likewise, an inheritance structured as a trust might fall outside the marriage and be out of reach for the other spouse. Most importantly, remember that divorce courts are courts of “equity.” As such, judges have significant leeway in reaching an equitable result. On the other hand, if you or your spouse received money from an estate during the marriage and deposited it into a shared account, the funds will most likely be considered marital property. Similarly, if one spouse inherited a house, but the couple fixed it up, rented it, and shared the income, it also may be seen as a joint asset. “Consult an estate specialist in your home state if you have questions about how to divide an inheritance that occurred during the course of the marriage,” says Bob.

       "   'content': \"For most people shopping for a home, price and location are top considerations. How much a bank is willing to lend—and under what conditions—also plays a role in determining what they can afford. That’s why it’s important to think strategically, particularly with rates near historically low levels. Let’s look at how two different types of mortgages—fixed-rate and adjustable-rate—can serve different types of borrowers, and how their relative advantages can change depending on prevailing interest rates. Fixed-rate mortgages A fixed-rate mortgage locks in both your interest rate and monthly payments for the life of your loan, offering the peace of mind that comes with stability. This is the most traditional form of mortgage. Reasons to consider a fixed-rate mortgage include: Predictable budgeting: Your repayment obligations will be clear. Interest rate stability: Your payment will hold steady for the entire term of the loan. Flexible terms: Most borrowers opt for a 30-year mortgage, but shorter terms, such as 15 or 20 years, are available and may be a better fit for your goals. Key takeaway: Fixed-rate mortgages are a good fit for most borrowers. They are appealing for those who plan to own their home for the long term and want peace of mind knowing their loan repayments will be steady and clear. If interest rates should fall during the life of the loan, borrowers could consider refinancing, but the goal is to not play the guessing game. With rates near historical lows, locking in today’s rates for the long term could make sense for many borrowers. Adjustable-rate mortgages An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) has a fixed interest rate for a specified initial term—say, five years—after which the interest rate may change (within limits) depending on prevailing interest rates. A five-year ARM, for example, offers a five-year fixed rate of interest, after which the rate can change every six months, but by no more than +/- 1 to 2%. Reasons to consider an ARM include: Lower initial rate: The interest rate during the initial fixed period is usually lower than that of a fixed-rate mortgage, which can save you money, if your goals align with this period. However, interest rates can go up steadily thereafter. Interest rate caps: To protect against significant interest rates moves, many ARMs offer limits on how much your rate can increase during any given interval (cap adjustment) and over the life of the loan (life cap). It's best to calculate the maximum interest rate your loan allows for once your initial period ends, and be prepared to make any necessary changes with your planning if interest rates should rise. Interest-only options: Some ARMs offer an interest-only payment option to lower your initial monthly payments even further. However, it is important to remember that during the interest-only period, your payments will not reduce your loan principal unless you choose to pay more than the minimum billed amount.1 Key takeaway: An ARM may be a good option for those with a specific purpose in mind, such as paying off the loan, selling the home, or refinancing the loan within the initial fixed-rate period. However, borrowers should be willing to take on the risk that interest rates could rise, and shouldn't assume that they can easily refinance or sell the home before rates change. Whether you choose a fixed-rate mortgage or an ARM, don’t be enticed into borrowing more than you can afford. Plan on what fits your budget and goals. 1Interest-only mortgages have an initial interest-only payment period followed by a fully amortizing payment period that includes both principal and interest.\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'As the number of defined-benefit pension plans steadily declines, the simpler days of expecting to reach retirement in good standing and start collecting a monthly pension check are gone for many people. Today, it\\'s essential for workers to participate in and contribute to their own retirement plans. While Social Security is a valuable resource, most people will find it isn\\'t enough to sustain their pre-retirement lifestyle after they stop working. The saving and investing you do while you\\'re employed will likely play a significant role in your financial life in retirement. So, it follows that the earlier you get started, the better. The key is to be realistic and build a plan you can follow. Start by creating a disciplined, prudent savings plan that defines your retirement goals and includes a monthly savings amount. To help understand how much you might need to be putting away, you can use a retirement calculator or get more help by working with a financial planner. The next step is to figure out where to put those savings. Retirement workhorses: 401(k)s and IRAs Most people have two types of accounts available to them: Workplace retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s1 Individual retirement accounts (IRA), including traditional and Roth IRAs Whether you use one or multiple account types will depend on your work status, what type of plan your workplace offers, your income, and how much you\\'re willing and able to save. So, which accounts, and what combinations, should you choose? If you have access to a 401(k) or similar employer plan and your employer offers a matching contribution, the best place to start is depositing at least up to the amount matched. With a traditional 401(k), you make contributions with pre-tax dollars, so you get a tax break up front, helping to lower your current income tax bill. Your money—both contributions and potential earnings—grows tax-deferred until you withdraw it. At that time, withdrawals are taxed at your current tax rate. There may be state taxes as well. To understand why you\\'d want to start with your workplace plan, consider this example: Let\\'s say you make $100,000 per year, and your employer matches your 401(k) contributions dollar-for-dollar up to 6% of your salary (the average employer match is closer to 3%). In this case, at least the first $6,000 of savings you earmark for retirement should go into your 401(k). You don\\'t want to give up the free money your employer is offering as a match. After you fund your 401(k) enough to get the full company match, you can still set aside more money in a tax-advantaged way—including additional contributions into your 401(k) or contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA—up to annual limits (see table below). For most people, if you have a 401(k) through your employer, it\\'s a good idea to continue to contribute as much as you can afford or what you calculate you need to reach your retirement savings goals, up to the annual limits. 2022 contribution limits for selected tax-deferred accounts *Contribution limits to a Roth IRA are limited by filing status and adjusted gross income. One convenience of a 401(k) is that contributions are deducted automatically from each paycheck, making it easy to regularly contribute to your account. You\\'re less likely to miss money that never shows up in your pocket or bank account in the first place—a behavior tested by time and science. Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA If you don\\'t have access to an employer sponsored plan like a 401(k) or if you\\'re already contributing up to the annual limit, a traditional or Roth IRA can help increase your retirement savings. For 2022, total IRA contributions (traditional, Roth, or both) are capped at $6,000 ($7,000 if you\\'re age 50 or older). One difference between the two IRAs is when and how your money is taxed: With a traditional IRA, contributions are made on a pre-tax basis, depending on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Also, contributions are generally tax-deductible,2 and you pay no taxes until you withdraw the money.3 With a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning there\\'s no potential tax deduction in the year of the contribution, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement so long as you\\'ve held the account for at least five years and you\\'re over age 59½. Be aware that to open a Roth IRA, your income must be below certain limits.4 How should you decide between a traditional or Roth IRA? If you expect to be in the same or a lower income tax bracket in retirement when you take withdrawals, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial. If you expect you to be in a higher tax bracket, a Roth IRA may make more sense—and it has other advantages over both a traditional IRA and 401(k), including no tax on your accumulated investment earnings. Also, unlike 401(k) plans and traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs aren\\'t subject to annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) starting at age 72 (70½ if you turned 70½ in 2019 or earlier). That\\'s an advantage if you want your savings to have more opportunity to grow tax-free through the later years of your retirement. It could also benefit your heirs, who\\'d be able take money out income tax-free after you\\'re gone. Note, though, that inherited Roth IRAs may be subject to RMDs for the beneficiary. Finally, contributing to a Roth IRA is a way to add more flexibility to your tax situation in retirement—having accounts with pre-tax and post-tax funds gives you more options for income and tax planning. The Roth 401(k) More and more employers are making a Roth option available in their 401(k) plans. A Roth 401(k) account works much like a Roth IRA, but there is no income limit to prevent participation. However, Roth 401(k)s are subject to RMDs, and note that any matching contributions from your employer must always go in a pre-tax account—even if you only have a Roth 401(k). Eligible employees can contribute up to the 2022 contribution limit of $20,500 per individual after tax (plus a $6,500 catch-up contribution for those 50 or older). Also, the balance from a Roth 401(k) can be rolled over directly into a regular Roth IRA when you leave the employer, thereby circumventing RMD rules. Assuming your employer offers the option, a Roth 401(k) could make sense if you think your tax bracket will be the same or higher in retirement or if you want flexibility and diversification in the way distributions will be taxed when you reach retirement, as described above. If you\\'re in a lower bracket when you retire, then a traditional 401(k) may end up being the better choice, as you\\'d pay less tax on future withdrawals than you would pay making post-tax contributions to a Roth 401(k) today. One way to hedge against uncertainty about future tax rates or your tax situation, or to provide more flexibility to manage taxes in retirement, may be to split your contributions between the traditional option and the Roth option, assuming your employer makes both available. Having multiple kinds of accounts would allow you to draw from across your taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts in a way that allows you to reduce your tax bill over time. So, instead of drawing from your tax-deferred accounts early in retirement and saving your tax-free accounts for later, you\\'d withdraw just enough from your taxable and tax-deferred accounts to \"fill up\" your tax bracket, and then tap tax-free sources for the remainder of your income needs each year. What if I\\'ve maxed out my 401(k) and IRA limits? If you\\'ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA options, congratulations. You\\'re making significant steps to save for retirement. If you want to save even more, consider a: Regular brokerage account Traditional brokerage accounts don\\'t offer the advantage of tax-free or tax-deferred investment earnings, but they can be relatively tax-efficient if managed smartly. Consider putting your least tax-efficient investments (actively managed mutual funds, REITs, and other securities where income is taxed when earned, for example) in your tax-advantaged retirement accounts and more tax-efficient investments (passively managed funds, exchanged-traded funds, municipal bonds and stocks held for more than one year, for example) in taxable brokerage accounts. Nondeductible contribution to a traditional IRA Even if you\\'re covered by an employer plan and you\\'re above the income limit for a Roth IRA or a deductible contribution to a traditional IRA, you could make a nondeductible (after-tax) contribution to a traditional IRA—but whether you should is a tough call. You won\\'t receive an up-front deduction, and any earnings will be taxed as ordinary income when you withdraw them. Alternatively, you could make a contribution to a nondeductible IRA and then turn around and convert that to a Roth IRA. The rules for conversions can be complex, so be sure to speak with the appropriate financial professional before doing a conversion. In the end, a regular brokerage account that contains tax-efficient investments may be more efficient. The advantage of tax-deferral rests primarily on the potential for tax-deferred compounding. But there are also ways you can invest to delay or defer taxes in taxable brokerage accounts by not trading actively and investing tax-efficiently. The bottom line If you haven\\'t begun to save for retirement—or you\\'re saving less than you should—get into the habit of \"paying yourself first.\" That is, contribute as much as you can afford to your retirement accounts before spending the funds on nonessentials. Now that you know more about which retirement accounts may make the most sense, it\\'s time to put your savings plan into action. 1 401(k) plans are mostly found in private sector workplaces, while 403(b) plans are usually offered to employees of educational organizations and non-profits. Some rules differ from 401(k) plans, but key points discussed in this article apply to both. 2 If you or your spouse is covered by a workplace retirement savings plan, the tax deductibility of contributions will be subject to income limits. Traditional IRA contributions are deductible if your 2022 modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is below $78,000 (single filers) or $129,000 (joint filers); if income is near those limits, contributions may be only partially deductible. 3 If you withdraw money from a traditional IRA before age 59½, your deductible contributions and earnings (including dividends, interest, and capital gains) will be taxed as ordinary income. You may also be subject to a 10% penalty on early withdrawals, and a state tax penalty may also apply. Consult IRS rules before contributing to or withdrawing money from a traditional IRA. 4 For 2022, you are eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA if your MAGI is below $144,000 (single filer) or $214,000 (joint filer); if your income is just below those levels, you may not be eligible to contribute the maximum.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Many companies now offer employer-sponsored Roth 401(k) retirement accounts alongside traditional 401(k) plans, giving employees another way to save for retirement. What\\'s the difference between the two accounts? And should you consider opening a Roth 401(k)? Here, we\\'ll take a look at how Roth 401(k) plans stack up against their traditional counterparts and what to consider before contributing to one. Roth 401(k) vs. traditional 401(k) Most people are familiar with how traditional 401(k) retirement plans work: An employee contributes pre-tax dollars and can choose from a variety of investment options. Then, contributions and potential earnings grow tax-deferred until they\\'re withdrawn, usually in retirement. With a Roth 401(k), the main difference is when the IRS takes its cut. You make Roth 401(k) contributions with money that has already been taxed—just as you would with a Roth individual retirement account (IRA). Any earnings then grow tax-free, and you pay no taxes when you start taking withdrawals in retirement.1 Another difference is that if you withdraw money from a traditional 401(k) plan before you turn 59½, you pay taxes and may potentially owe a 10% penalty on the entire distribution.2 With a Roth 401(k), your non-qualified withdrawals are a pro-rata amount of your contributions and earnings, and you may potentially be subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty on funds that are considered gross income.3 One similarity between Roth and traditional 401(k)s is that you must start taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) once you reach age 72 (70 1/2 if you turned 70 1/2 in 2019 or earlier) to avoid facing a penalty. However, you can get around this requirement when you retire by rolling your Roth 401(k) into a Roth IRA, which has no RMDs.4 This way, your assets have the opportunity to grow tax-free, and if you pass down your IRA to your heirs, they won\\'t have to pay taxes on distributions either. \"This flexibility is a significant difference between Roth and traditional 401(k)s or IRAs,\" says Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Choosing a Roth 401(k) or a traditional 401(k) might not be an either-or decision. If your employer offers both, you can contribute to a Roth 401(k) as well as a traditional 401(k). Your employer can also match both, but funds to your traditional 401(k) go directly into your account whereas with a Roth 401(k), they\\'re deposited into a separate tax-deferred account. Also, keep in mind that your annual contribution limit would apply across the two accounts. For example, you can\\'t contribute the 2022 salary deferral limit of $20,500 ($27,000 if you\\'re age 50 or older) to each 401(k). Instead, you must divide the total amount between accounts—for instance, putting $10,000 in one and $10,500 in the other. The same goes for your total annual contribution amount ($61,000, or $67,500 if you\\'re age 50 or older), which includes employer matches. Which account is right for you? Traditional 401(k) Taxes: You make pre-tax contributions and pay tax on withdrawals in retirement Salary deferral limits for 2022: $20,500 ($27,000 if you\\'re age 50 or older) Employer match: Funds are added directly to your 401(k) account Total contribution limits for 2022: $61,000 ($67,500 if you\\'re age 50 or older), includes salary deferral amount and employer matches RMDs You must take RMDs starting at age 72 (70 1/2 if you turned 70 1/2 in 2019 or earlier) Heirs are subject to RMDs and taxed on distributions Roth 401(k) Taxes: You make after-tax contributions and don\\'t pay tax on qualified withdrawals in retirement Salary deferral limits for 2022: $20,500 ($27,000 if you\\'re age 50 or older) Employer match: Funds are deposited into a separate tax-deferred account Total contribution limits for 2022: $61,000 ($67,500 if you\\'re age 50 or older), includes salary deferral amount and employer matches RMDs You must take RMDs starting at age 72 (70 1/2 if you turned 70 1/2 in 2019 or earlier); however, you could roll over funds to a Roth IRA to avoid RMDs Heirs are subject to RMDs but not taxed on distributions Now that you have a better understanding of a Roth 401(k), you might be wondering how it differs from a Roth IRA. Contributions to either account type are made with after-tax dollars, and you won\\'t pay taxes on qualified distributions. The differences between the two types of Roth accounts come down to contribution limits, income limits, and RMDs. IRA contributions are capped at $6,000 per year—$7,000 if you\\'re 50 or older. For 2022, you can contribute to a Roth IRA only if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is less than $144,000 for single filers or $214,000 for married couples filing jointly or a qualified widow(er). With a Roth IRA, you won\\'t be required to take RMDs. Your heirs, on the other hand, must take RMDs, but as with a Roth 401(k), they won\\'t be taxed on withdrawals. Finally, a Roth 401(k) is only available through an employer plan. If your employer offers only a traditional 401(k) and matches contributions, you\\'ll be passing up free money by not participating. As long as you meet the above MAGI income requirements, you can open a Roth IRA on your own as part of your retirement strategy. When a Roth 401(k) can make sense Taxes are a key consideration when it comes to deciding on a Roth 401(k) over a traditional 401(k). If you\\'re young and currently in a low tax bracket but you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, then a Roth 401(k) could be a better deal than a traditional 401(k). Think of it this way: With a Roth 401(k), you can get your tax obligation out of the way when your tax rate is low and then enjoy the tax-free earnings later in life. The same argument can apply to mid-career workers as well, especially those concerned about the prospects for higher tax rates in the future. After all, current tax rates are fairly low by historical standards. The top rate for married couples filing jointly is 37% in 2022, but it was 70% in 1981 and an eye-watering 91% back in 1963.5 \"On the flip side, it may make less sense to contribute to a Roth 401(k) if you think your tax bracket will be lower in retirement than it is now,\" Rob says. And high earners who expect to maintain their income and spending standards into retirement could consider using Roth 401(k)s to simplify their taxes by paying them up front while they\\'re still working. Doing this would mean that you would still take RMDs from your Roth 401(k) but with less of a tax impact since distributions are tax-free. RMDs from a traditional 401(k), however, would be treated as taxable income. Covering your bases through tax diversification If you\\'re not sure where your tax rate, income, and spending will be in retirement, one strategy might be to contribute to both a Roth 401(k) and a traditional 401(k). The combination will provide you with both taxable and tax-free withdrawal options. As a retired individual or married couple with both Roth 401(k) and traditional 401(k) accounts, you could determine which account to tap based on your tax situation. \"You can\\'t really know what future tax rates will look like, so building in the flexibility to use multiple accounts to manage taxes is important and helpful,\" says Rob. For example, you could take RMDs from your traditional account and withdraw what you need beyond that amount from the Roth account, tax-free. That would mean you could withdraw a large chunk of money from a Roth 401(k) one year—say, to pay for a dream vacation—without having to worry about taking a big tax hit. Besides the added flexibility of being able to manage your marginal income tax bracket, reducing your taxable income in retirement may be advantageous for a number of reasons, including lowering the amount you pay in Medicare premiums, paring down the tax rate on your Social Security benefits, and maximizing the availability of other income-based deductions. Be sure to weigh all your available options to maintain your retirement goals. 1Individuals must have the Roth 401(k) account established for five years and be over the age of 59½ for tax-free withdrawals. 2Individuals separating from service on or after the year that they turn 55 are exempt from the 10% penalty. 3To be a \"qualified distribution\" the following rules must be met: 1) You have reached age 59½ (or have died or become disabled), and 2) At least five years have passed since the first day of the calendar year in which you first made a Roth contribution to the retirement plan. 4Rolling over a Roth 401(k) balance to a new Roth IRA may restart the five-year qualification period. The qualification period would then be calculated from the initial deposit into the IRA and the rollover will be eligible for tax-free withdrawals when that five-year period has ended (and the age qualifier has been met). 5The Tax Foundation, 3/22/2017.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I was divorced last year and receive both alimony and child support from my ex. Can I use this money to fund an IRA? —A Reader Dear Reader, While I'm happy to see you're interested in funding an IRA, unfortunately, under current tax law you can't use either alimony or child support to do it. IRA contributions can only be made from earned (taxable) income. Child support has never been taxable. And while alimony used to be considered taxable income, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed that. If the divorce agreement was signed after December 31, 2018, alimony is neither tax deductible for the payer nor taxable for the recipient. So the good news is you don't need to pay income taxes on your alimony. On the flip side, you can't use it to contribute to a tax-advantaged IRA. But that doesn't mean you can't invest this money wisely. Start with your goals Before you invest, think about three things: what you're investing for, how much risk you can afford to take, and the time you have to keep your money invested. Then take a careful look at your current financial situation. Do you have an emergency fund? Are you getting the full match in your 401k? Are there gaps in your insurance needs? Do you have credit card debt? These factors will help you determine how much and where you should invest. Explore your investing options Child support is intended to be used specifically for the benefit of the child. So even though you can't use child support and alimony to fund an IRA, there are several other smart ways to invest it. Some are taxable and some offer tax advantages similar to an IRA. Here are a few options to consider: Brokerage account—A brokerage account doesn’t provide tax deferral, but there are no contribution or withdrawal limits. You can use a regular brokerage account or set up a custodial brokerage account under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) to invest for a variety of goals. Investing in a broad-based mutual fund, exchange-traded fund (ETF) or fractional shares is one way to get started. Health Savings Account (HSA)—An HSA is available if you have a qualifying high-deductible health plan (with minimum deductibles currently at $1,400 for individuals and $2,800 for families). You may think of it only as a way to save for medical expenses, but there's more to it. Contributions are tax-deductible federally and in most states, and earnings grow tax-sheltered. Plus, there's no tax on withdrawals if used for qualified medical expenses. On top of that, the money rolls over year after year and you can typically invest it similar to an IRA. It can be a great way to cover your family's health care costs as well as save and invest for the future. Contribution limits for 2022 are $3,650 for an individual, $7,300 for a family. 529 College Savings Plan—A 529 is an excellent way to save for your kids' college and enjoy some tax perks too. Some states offer tax deductions or credits for contributions, earnings grow tax sheltered—and you don't pay federal income tax (or state income tax in most states) on withdrawals as long as the money is used for qualified education expenses. This includes a variety of post-secondary options as well as up to $10,000 annually in elementary or high school tuition. Don't forget about the Child Tax Credit Since we're talking about tax advantages, here's a reminder about the Child Tax Credit as well as the Child and Dependent Care credit. Each tax credit has been expanded for this year by the American Rescue Plan—and each can be significant in reducing your tax liability and possibly increasing the amount of money you can save and invest. Now back to that IRA You don't say if you have earned income in addition to alimony and child support, but if you do, try to carve out something for an annual IRA contribution. It can be a challenge, but even a small amount saved consistently can make a big difference in your future. Your best bet? Make it automatic! For an extra boost, see if you qualify for the Saver's Credit, which is a special tax break for low- to moderate-income taxpayers saving for retirement. As you can see, you have a number of options for putting your money to work for you and your child. Check in with an accountant or financial advisor to make sure you're taking full advantage of all the possibilities and to help refine your strategy. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, Lately every time I shop online, I see an option to pay in several installments—with no interest. I’m tempted to try it, but is there a catch? —A Reader Dear Reader, This is such a timely question, and smart of you to ask before diving in! As you’ve noticed, “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) options are exploding, with retailers ranging from department stores to airlines allowing customers to pay for goods and services in installments rather than all at once. In fact, in 2021 over half of consumers have used a BNPL service such as Klarna, Afterpay or Affirm to finance their purchases. Much of this meteoric growth is due to the huge surge in online shopping during the pandemic. And as you mention, spreading out your payments over time, free of interest (provided you pay on time), can be enticing. Taken together, it’s not at all surprising BNPL services have taken off. But that said, there are some significant potential gotchas to think about before you give it a try. Let’s take a look at how BNPL services work—so that you can understand their pros and cons—and make an informed decision about when they may (or may not) be a good choice. How “Buy Now, Pay Later” works BNPL plans work like an old-fashioned layaway plan in reverse. Instead of having the merchant hold on to the item until you complete all your installment payments, you receive your goods or services up front. There’s no credit check (you’re accepted or rejected after providing only your name, address, phone number and birthdate), and you pay over time through your debit or credit card—typically in four installments separated by two weeks. In effect, the merchant and BNPL company are giving you an interest-free mini-loan. The BNPL company charges the merchant a fee, and the merchant looks to compensate for that by increasing overall sales. Everything works as planned if you pay on time. However, if you’re late or miss a scheduled payment, you can incur substantial late fees and possibly interest charges. In addition, late or missed payments can damage your credit. When BNPL might make sense Paying cash (even if over time) is cheaper than financing a purchase where you pay interest—whether that’s for a car, a refrigerator or even a pair of shoes. Given that, there are times when using a BNPL can make sense. For example, let’s say you need a new computer for work, but don’t currently have a spare $2,000 after exhausting your emergency fund. Or perhaps you unexpectedly have to purchase an expensive plane ticket to care for a family member. In these cases, making four interest-free payments every two weeks could be a godsend—and a definite plus over carrying a balance on a high-interest credit card. It’s also true that it’s easier to qualify for a BNPL service than for a credit card. That’s probably one of the reasons many younger people who haven’t had the time to build their credit history or buyers with poor credit are more likely to use BNPL (although usage continues to climb across all ages). How BNPL can cause problems So what’s the catch? Actually, there are several. First, BNPL services are not currently as highly regulated by the government as credit and debit cards. Depending on the service, you likely won’t receive the same consumer protections you can get with a credit card company (for example, getting a refund for a defective product or service you never received). Second, you may find it more difficult to stay on top of multiple purchases and payments, complicating your ability to track your spending and accurately budget. Plus, even if you make every payment on time, using BNPL services often won’t build your credit score, which can haunt you later if you’re trying to get a home mortgage, rent an apartment, or even get a job! But to my mind, the most serious downside of BNPL is the temptation to overspend. As behavioral economists have shown us, we humans don’t always (or even often) make the soundest financial decisions. Our emotions and biases can easily take over our common sense. Therefore, a basic tenet of behavioral economics is to make the good things easy—and the bad things hard. BNPL (and online shopping, for that matter) can do the opposite. In fact, one study found that 45 percent of BNPL users make purchases that don’t fit in their budget. In other words, by easing the way for impulse purchases, BNPL can make it very easy to live beyond your means—which can stand in your way of building a solid financial future. The tried-and-true rules of money management still hold Like credit cards or debit cards, a BNPL service is simply a financial tool. It’s not universally good or bad in all situations, but just a way for you to manage your finances. The key is for you to remain in charge, and not let the tool rule you or cause you financial harm. To keep impulse buying (and your budget) in check, keep your goals top of mind and consider the benefits of just paying cash. If you’re disciplined about budgeting and saving, spreading out your payments over time can be helpful. But if you use BNPL to support an unsustainable lifestyle or it’s impeding your ability to fund other important goals (an emergency fund, retirement, paying down existing debt), that’s a problem. In those cases, it’s best to take a deep breath and walk away from your shopping cart. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Would you ever buy a car—or even a new pair of shoes—without looking for the best deal? Probably not. So, why don’t more investors comparison shop for bonds? “Many investors simply don’t realize different firms charge different prices for the exact same bond,” says Kathy Jones, managing director and chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. The problem stems from the fact that bonds don’t trade on centralized markets like stocks, which makes their true cost difficult—if not impossible—to ascertain. Instead, most are purchased “over the counter” through a brokerage firm that buys the bond on your behalf. The firm then tacks on a fee, or markup, that can range from a fraction of a percent to several percentage points, depending on factors such as bond liquidity and the firm executing the trade. “Too many brokerages not only charge far too much but also conceal such costs from investors,” Kathy says. So, before you buy your next bond, ask your broker these important questions—and be sure you’re satisfied with the answers. What’s the market price? This will reflect the actual price it costs your broker to buy a bond from another dealer (which may include fees paid to the dealer). What’s the markup? A markup refers to the difference between the market price of a bond and the price a broker-dealer charges to sell it. A markup is generally wrapped into the price—and may or may not be disclosed. Are there additional fees? In addition to markup, brokers may charge miscellaneous fees to cover administrative services, clearing fees, overhead, etc.—which, as with the markup, they may or may not be required to disclose. What’s the accrued interest? When you buy a bond between coupon payment dates, you’ll owe the seller any accrued interest since the last payment date. This cost has nothing to do with your broker but does factor into the total cost. What’s the overall cost? This will include all of the above: the market price plus any markup, additional fees, and accrued interest. “Be wary of firms that fail to give you direct answers about their fees,” Kathy advises. “They’re probably being opaque for a reason.” Indeed, even seemingly small differences in markups can mean giving up hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in total returns over time. And with prices and yields fluctuating to the degree they have recently, it pays to shop around.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'We ran the numbers on market timing. Our findings? There’s a high cost to waiting for the best entry point.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Imagine for a moment that you\\'ve just received a year-end bonus or income tax refund. You\\'re not sure whether to invest now or wait. After all, the market recently hit an all-time high. Now imagine that you face this kind of decision every year—sometimes in up markets, other times in downturns. Is there a good rule of thumb to follow? Our research shows that the cost of waiting for the perfect moment to invest typically exceeds the benefit of even perfect timing.1 And because timing the market perfectly is nearly impossible, the best strategy for most of us is not to try to market-time at all. Instead, make a plan and invest as soon as possible. Five investing styles But don\\'t take our word for it. Consider our research on the performance of five hypothetical long-term investors following very different investment strategies. Each received $2,000 at the beginning of every year for the 20 years ending in 2020 and left the money in the stock market, as represented by the S&P 500® Index.2 (While we recommend diversifying your portfolio with a mix of assets appropriate for your goals and risk tolerance, we\\'re focusing on stocks to illustrate the impact of market timing.) Check out how they fared: Peter Perfect was a perfect market timer. He had incredible skill (or luck) and was able to place his $2,000 into the market every year at the lowest closing point. For example, Peter had $2,000 to invest at the start of 2001. Rather than putting it immediately into the market, he waited and invested on September 21, 2001—that year\\'s lowest closing level for the S&P 500. At the beginning of 2002, Peter received another $2,000. He waited and invested the money on October 9, 2002, the lowest closing level for the market for that year. He continued to time his investments perfectly every year through 2020. Ashley Action took a simple, consistent approach: Each year, once she received her cash, she invested her $2,000 in the market on the first trading day of the year. Matthew Monthly divided his annual $2,000 allotment into 12 equal portions, which he invested at the beginning of each month. This strategy is known as dollar-cost averaging. You may already be doing this through regular investments in your 401(k) plan or an Automatic Investment Plan (AIP), which allows you to deposit money into investments like mutual funds on a set timetable. Rosie Rotten had incredibly poor timing—or perhaps terribly bad luck: She invested her $2,000 each year at the market\\'s peak. For example, Rosie invested her first $2,000 on January 30, 2001—that year\\'s highest closing level for the S&P 500. She received her second $2,000 at the beginning of 2002 and invested it on January 4, 2002, the peak for that year. Larry Linger left his money in cash investments (using Treasury bills as a proxy) every year and never got around to investing in stocks at all. He was always convinced that lower stock prices—and, therefore, better opportunities to invest his money—were just around the corner. The results are in: Investing immediately paid off For the winner, look at the graph, which shows how much hypothetical wealth each of the five investors had accumulated at the end of the 20 years (2001-2020). Actually, we looked at 76 separate 20-year periods in all, finding similar results across almost all time periods. Naturally, the best results belonged to Peter, who waited and timed his annual investment perfectly: He accumulated $151,391. But the study\\'s most stunning findings concern Ashley, who came in second with $135,471—only $15,920 less than Peter Perfect. This relatively small difference is especially surprising considering that Ashley had simply put her money to work as soon as she received it each year—without any pretense of market timing. Matthew\\'s dollar-cost-averaging approach performed nearly as well, earning him third place with $134,856 at the end of 20 years. That didn\\'t surprise us. After all, in a typical 12-month period, the market has risen 75.6% of the time.3 So Ashley\\'s pattern of investing first thing did, over time, yield lower buying prices than Matthew\\'s monthly discipline and, thus, higher ending wealth. Even bad timing trumps inertia Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Invested $2,000 annually in a hypothetical portfolio that tracks the S&P 500® Index from 2001-2020. The individual who never bought stocks in the example invested in a hypothetical portfolio that tracks the lbbotson U.S. 30-day Treasury Bill Index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. The examples are hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. They are not intended to represent a specific investment product, and investors may not achieve similar results. Dividends and interest are assumed to have been reinvested, and the examples do not reflect the effects of taxes, expenses, or fees. Had fees, expenses, or taxes been considered, returns would have been substantially lower. Rosie Rotten\\'s results also proved surprisingly encouraging. While her poor timing left her $14,300 short of Ashley (who didn\\'t try timing investments), Rosie still earned nearly three times what she would have if she hadn\\'t invested in the market at all. And what of Larry Linger, the procrastinator who kept waiting for a better opportunity to buy stocks—and then didn\\'t buy at all? He fared worst of all, with only $44,438. His biggest worry had been investing at a market high. Ironically, had he done that each year, he would have earned far more over the 20-year period. The rules generally don\\'t change Regardless of the time period considered, the rankings turn out to be remarkably similar. We analyzed all 76 rolling 20-year periods dating back to 1926 (e.g., 1926-1945, 1927-1946, etc.). In 66 of the 76 periods, the rankings were exactly the same; that is, Peter Perfect was first, Ashley Action second, Matthew Monthly third, Rosie Rotten fourth and Larry Linger last. But what about the 10 periods when the results were not as expected? Even in these periods, investing immediately never came in last. It was in its normal second place four times, third place five times and fourth place only once, from 1962 to 1981, one of the few periods of persistently weak equity markets. What\\'s more, during that period, fourth, third and second places were virtually tied. Only 10 of 76 periods had unexpected rankings Ranking of ending amount of wealth after 20-year period. Rankings are hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. We also looked at all possible 30-, 40- and 50-year time periods, starting in 1926. If you don\\'t count the few instances when investing immediately swapped places with dollar cost averaging, all of these time periods followed the same pattern. In every 30-, 40- and 50-year period, perfect timing was first, followed by investing immediately or dollar cost averaging, bad timing and, finally, never buying stocks. What this might mean for you If you make an annual investment (such as a contribution to an IRA or to a child\\'s 529 plan) and you\\'re not sure whether to invest in January of each year, wait for a \"better\" time or dribble your investment out evenly over the year, be decisive. The best course of action for most of us is to create an appropriate plan and take action on that plan as soon as possible. It\\'s nearly impossible to accurately identify market bottoms on a regular basis. So, realistically, the best action that a long-term investor can take, based on our study, is to determine how much exposure to the stock market is appropriate for your goals and risk tolerance and then consider investing as soon as possible, regardless of the current level of the stock market. If you\\'re tempted to try to wait for the best time to invest in the stock market, our study suggests that the benefits of doing this aren\\'t all that impressive—even for perfect timers. Remember, over 20 years, Peter Perfect amassed $15,920 more than the investor who put her cash to work right away. Even badly timed stock market investments were much better than no stock market investments at all. Our study suggests that investors who procrastinate are likely to miss out on the stock market\\'s potential growth. By perpetually waiting for the \"right time,\" Larry sacrificed $76,733 compared to even the worst market timer, who invested in the market at each year\\'s high. Consider dollar-cost averaging as a compromise If you don\\'t have the opportunity, or stomach, to invest your lump sum all at once, consider investing smaller amounts more frequently. As long as you stick with it, dollar-cost averaging can offer several benefits: Prevents procrastination. Some of us just have a hard time getting started. We know we should be investing, but we never quite get around to it. Much like a regular 401(k) payroll deduction, dollar-cost averaging helps you force yourself to invest consistently. Minimizes regret. Even the most even-tempered stock trader feels at least a tinge of regret when an investment proves to be poorly timed. Worse, such regret may cause you to disrupt your investment strategy in an attempt to make up for your setback. Dollar-cost averaging can help minimize this regret because you make multiple investments, none of them particularly large. Avoids market timing. Dollar-cost averaging ensures that you will participate in the stock market regardless of current conditions. While this will not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market, it will eliminate the temptation to try market-timing strategies that rarely succeed. As you strive to reach your financial goals, keep these research findings in mind. It may be tempting to try to wait for the \"best time\" to invest—especially in a volatile market environment. But before you do, remember the high cost of waiting. Even the worst possible market timers in our studies would have beat not investing in the stock market at all. In brief Given the difficulty of timing the market, the most realistic strategy for the majority of investors would be to invest in stocks immediately. Procrastination can be worse than bad timing. Long term, it\\'s almost always better to invest in stocks—even at the worst time each year—than not to invest at all. Dollar-cost averaging is a good plan if you\\'re prone to regret after a large investment has a short-term drop, or if you like the discipline of investing small amounts as you earn them. 1 In the hypothetical situation discussed in this article, the cost of waiting for the perfect moment to invest is quantified as the difference in ending amounts between waiting in cash and dollar-cost averaging. The benefit of perfect timing is quantified as the difference in ending amounts between perfect timing and dollar-cost averaging. The cost of waiting is therefore $90,418 and the benefit of perfect timing is $16,535. 2 All investors received $2,000 to invest before the first market open of each year. Investments were made using monthly data. 3 Study of 1,129 one-year periods, rolling monthly. First period is January 1926 to December 1926. Last period is January 2020 to December 2020.'},\n",

But while the numbers may be dazzling short-term, even if money is managed wisely, there\\'s no guarantee it will last. Recent studies by the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center (GFLEC) found that even for NFL and NBA athletes with long careers, being successful and well-paid does not provide much protection against the risk of going bankrupt. Unfortunately, we hear too often about pro athletes—or anyone else, for that matter, who quickly attain large sums of money—mishandling their finances. However there are some positive examples, too. For instance, NFL linebacker Brandon Copeland reportedly spends only 10-15 percent of his $1 million-plus salary and saves the rest. Golden State Warrior Draymond Green is a big proponent of smart investing to grow one\\'s wealth. With a little coaching, anyone, including your son, can learn the basics of good money management. Here are some cautions as well as concrete actions to discuss with him. Beware of lifestyle creep When what once was a luxury now seems like a necessity, you can easily be drawn into lifestyle creep where you spend more as you make more. And while it\\'s great to enjoy one\\'s financial success and the increased standard of living that comes with it, maintaining an unsustainable spending rate can lead to financial ruin. It may seem counter intuitive, but your son should actually try to live below his means. High earners often have big fluctuations in how much they make one year to the next. Because the money he’s earning now could stop suddenly and with little warning, he really needs to focus on what he\\'s spending—both on necessities and extras. Does that sound like creating a budget? It is. And it\\'s necessary no matter how much money you have. Don\\'t fall for the hype Part of what leads to lifestyle creep are the \"expected\" trappings associated with high earners—things like big houses and fancy cars. Social media pressure has been shown to negatively affect people\\'s finances. For someone in the public eye, the pressure can be even greater. Encourage your son to focus on what he wants—not on what other people expect. And that includes what he might want in the future, which leads to my next point. Set some goals Now\\'s the time for your son to consider his future self, not just theoretically, but practically. Will he have a family? Put kids through college? What will he do post-career? Launch a new business? Create a charitable foundation? Encourage him to be realistic on how long his career may last, write down his goals and put dollar figures and a timeline against them. Professional sports careers are often short and transitioning into another career can take time. With money flowing freely, he\\'s in the enviable position of being able to direct a good portion of his income toward his goals now—and probably reach them far sooner than most. Play defense by saving Saving is the best defense against future unknowns no matter how much you earn. This is especially important for your son. Here\\'s how I\\'d prioritize his savings: Create a substantial emergency/contingency fund. This is a good backup plan for everyone, and it\\'s generally recommended to keep enough cash to cover 3-6 months worth of essential expenses easily accessible. For a professional athlete, where a serious injury or job change could mean a major financial shift, I\\'d suggest 1-2 years and looking into specialized disability insurance. Max out tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Your son should take full advantage of whatever retirement package is available. With his salary he may be able to max out a 401(k) and add an IRA as well. The maximum annual 401(k) contribution for 2022 is $20,500. For an IRA, it\\'s $6,000. Contributions can offer both present and future tax perks. Tax, investment and legal specialists can help determine if other types of retirement accounts like a SEP IRA or individual 401(k) are a good fit for his situation. Save even more in a brokerage account. Unlike 401(k)s, IRAs and annuities specifically designed for retirement (withdrawals prior to 59½ are subject to a 10 percent penalty and ordinary income taxes), you can save for any goal in a brokerage account and withdraw money at any time. Consider annuities. A deferred annuity could complement other retirement plans. There are no contribution limits, earnings grow tax-sheltered and it can be set up to provide guaranteed income. Because annuities are designed for long term investing, and can be more complex when it comes to taxes and fees, it\\'s best to work with a trusted advisor when considering a purchase. Play offense by investing Saving gets you in the game; investing can take you to the goal—especially over the long-term. Young people have the advantage of time to potentially ride out market volatility and invest more aggressively. Diversifying by owning different kinds of investments (stocks, bonds, cash, commodities) based on your risk tolerance can help reduce risk and is often essential to long-term success. But while your son has the means to put his money to work, he should be wary of risky business ventures (nightclubs, restaurants, hedge funds). Recruit the right financial team A good financial team—an investment advisor, accountant, attorney, insurance and tax professional—is essential, and can help your son uncover risks and develop tax-smart strategies to secure his financial success. For example, his financial team could potentially help set up insurance and trusts to shield his assets, provide advice on compensation and benefit plans, or help him select the most advantageous principal residence. With these things in place, your son can continue to enjoy his current success and at the same time feel more confident about his future. To me, that\\'s the best game plan.

If the victim responds, \"No,\" the fraudster follows up with a phone call claiming to be from where the alleged purchase was made or the victim\\'s financial institution and asks for sensitive personal information. If you receive this kind of suspicious communication, immediately contact the financial institution in question at a known number. At Schwab, that number is 800-435-4000.

       "   'abstract': 'Learn how stop orders can help traders gain better control of their trade objectives.',\n",
       "   'content': 'A stop order can be a powerful tool that when used effectively, gives traders more control over their trade objectives. Here we explain what a stop order is, how it works, why and when you might use them, and the risks of this order type. What is a stop order? A stop order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the market price once the stock has traded at or through a specified price (the \"stop\"). How does a stop order work? When a stop order is submitted, it is sent to the execution venue and placed on the order book, where it remains until the stop triggers, expires, or is canceled by the trader. Once triggered, a stop order becomes a market order, which will generally result in an execution. However, a specific execution price or price range isn\\'t guaranteed—the resulting execution price may be above, at, or below the stop price itself. Therefore, traders should carefully consider when to employ a stop order. Why should I use stop orders? You can use a stop order as an automatic entry or exit trigger upon a certain level of price movement in a specified direction; it\\'s often used to attempt to protect an unrealized gain or minimize a loss. Sell stop: A sell stop represents a market order to sell at the next available bid price, if/when the trade price decreases to, or down through, the stop price. You should enter a stop price for a sell stop order below the current bid price; otherwise, it may trigger immediately. Buy stop: Although more commonly used as an exit strategy, stop orders can also be used to enter a position once it reaches or surpasses a particular price threshold. A buy stop order represents a market order to buy shares at the next available ask price, if and when the last trade price increases to, or up through, the stop price. You should enter the stop price for a buy stop order above the current ask price; otherwise, it may trigger immediately. When should I use stop orders? Because stop orders result in the submission of a market order, the same execution and eligibility characteristics apply: Stop orders will only trigger during the standard market session, 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. ET. Stop orders will not execute during extended-hours sessions, such as pre-market or after-hours sessions, or take effect when the stock is not trading (e.g., during stock halts or on weekends or market holidays). Although stop orders only trigger during the standard market session, traders can decide whether the stop should only be effective for the current market session or carry over to future market sessions. Stop orders designated as day orders expire at the end of the current market session, if not yet triggered. Good-till-canceled (GTC) stop orders carry over to future standard sessions if they haven’t been triggered. At Schwab, GTC remain in force for up to 60 calendar days unless canceled. What are the risks of using stop orders? Stop orders submit a market order when triggered, generally guaranteeing execution unless trading is halted or closed. However, guaranteed execution comes with some tradeoffs, so understanding the risks you face is important. Gaps: Stop orders are vulnerable to pricing gaps, which can sometimes occur between trading sessions or during pauses in trading, such as trading halts. The execution price can be higher or lower than the stop’s trigger price, which only denotes when the order should be submitted. Fast markets: How fast prices move can also affect the execution price. When the market fluctuates, particularly during periods of high trading volume, the price at which your order executes may not be the same as the price you saw at the time the order was routed for execution. Liquidity: You could receive different prices for parts of your order, especially for orders that involve large numbers of shares. No market for the security: If there’s no “market” for the stock (meaning that there’s no bid or no ask available) or if the stock itself isn\\'t open for trading, the market order triggered by your stop can’t execute. Bottom line Stop orders can be a useful tool if your priority is immediate execution when the stock reaches a designated price, and you’re willing to accept the risk of a trade price that is away from your stop value. However, before placing a stop order, you should understand how market hours, liquidity, and market speed can affect the execution and pricing of a stop order.'}],\n",

       "   'content': 'Travel has become more expensive—a fact you\\'re probably well aware of if you\\'re taking a trip overseas this summer. While there\\'s no price you can put on making memories that will last a lifetime, there\\'s also no reason to spend money on fees you can easily avoid. Here are five tips for keeping costs low and managing your money during your next trip abroad. 1. Steer clear of transaction costs Most credit and debit card issuers charge foreign-transaction fees, which typically run between 1% and 3% of the purchase price, as well as ATM fees. That might seem like a minor expense per transaction, but all those extra charges can really add up. Look into the fees imposed by your banks and credit card companies. (The overall fee is often a combination of two fees, one from the issuing bank and one from the card company.) And note that even if you have a fee-free card, ATMs or merchants may still charge a fee. Always check your card\\'s terms and conditions to find out exactly what fees you\\'re responsible for. 2. Find the best exchange rate Airport currency kiosks may be convenient, but they also tend to be pricey, charging anywhere from $5 to $15 to exchange money. Even so-called no-fee exchanges tend to make a profit off their highly unfavorable exchange rates. Cash withdrawals from ATMs are generally the best choice for day-to-day funds—but, again, beware of transaction fees. Some banks impose a flat fee per withdrawal, while others do not and may even refund those levied by others. If you anticipate needing cash, exchanging currency at your local bank, post office, or American Express office before you leave may provide a lower rate. Once you arrive at your destination, you might be able to get a decent exchange rate at your hotel as well. 3. Watch out for \"dynamic currency conversion\" Many travelers are enticed by the convenience and familiarity of receiving bills—at restaurants, for instance—in U.S. dollars. But this new trend, called dynamic currency conversion, often comes with an unfavorable exchange rate, transaction fees, or both. So, when asked if you want to pay a bill in the local currency or in U.S. dollars, go with the local option—unless you can verify that the cost is negligible and worth it, to you, for the familiarity factor. 4. Secure your information Nothing ruins a trip like a lost or stolen wallet, so take a picture of the contents of your wallet, including the fronts and backs of credit, debit, and insurance cards so you can find all of those important phone numbers to call in case of emergency. Keep a copy on your phone—or better yet, in the cloud—along with pictures of your passport and any other important documentation. Also, be sure to activate fraud alerts for all accounts that offer them so you\\'re notified right away of suspicious activity. Sophisticated cybercriminals are often able to capture your financial information even if your cards stay in your possession. You may be able to set up a travel notice to have your bank monitor your accounts for fraudulent activity when traveling. When travel monitoring is active, debit and credit cards are scrutinized for high-risk transactions. 5. Take advantage of built-in benefits Before you book your trip, see if your credit or debit cards offer travel-related perks that can save you money or ease your journey. For example, many offer hotel and restaurant reservation assistance, free Wi-Fi access on eligible flights, and even discounts on certain types of accommodation and transportation. Review your cards\\' benefit terms, or call your providers for full details. A cost-conscious travel companion The Schwab Bank Visa® Platinum Debit Card (available to Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking® account* holders) provides a wealth of benefits, even when you\\'re traveling abroad: It\\'s accepted at millions of merchant outlets and ATMs in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.† You incur no foreign-exchange transaction fees for purchases made with your debit card.‡ It provides extra layers of protection like card lock/unlock, transaction and account alerts, two-way fraud text alerts, and travel notifications. Unlimited ATM cash withdrawal fees are rebated on a monthly basis.§ It offers additional travel benefits, including Fraud Protection for Unauthorized Transfers or Purchases, Travel Accident Insurance, and Travel and Emergency Assistance Services. It\\'s linked to a Schwab One® brokerage account with no minimum balance requirement and free online transfers between accounts. Schwab Bank cards are also covered by the Schwab Security Guarantee.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I'm 27, and my husband is 32. We're starting to think about saving for retirement. He has a 401(k) at work, but I'm a hairstylist at a small salon that doesn't offer any retirement benefits. What's the best way for me to save? —A Reader Dear Reader, Starting to save for retirement early is one of the most important things you can do, so kudos for some smart thinking. At your age, if you save just 10%–15% of your annual income from now until you reach retirement age, you should be in pretty good financial shape. At your husband's age, he might consider bumping that up to 15%–20% if he's just beginning to save in his 401(k). Your husband is lucky to have a 401(k). It makes saving easier because the money is automatically deducted from his paycheck each month. Plus, he may get an employer match (and if he does, make sure he always contributes at least enough to capture the maximum amount). But like you, not everyone has that opportunity. Currently, about a third of Americans don't have an employer-sponsored retirement plan. But that shouldn't keep anyone from starting to save. It may take a little more effort and discipline to create your own retirement plan, but it's well worth it. Here's what I suggest. An IRA is a good first choice An IRA is an Individual Retirement Account that you open in your own name. Like a 401(k), savings grow tax-deferred, which means you don't pay income taxes on the earnings as long as the money is in the account. Currently, you can contribute up to $6,000 a year to an IRA (with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50-plus). That would be a good start to your savings. You do have a couple of IRA choices, so before you open one, you'll need to consider which type of IRA is best for you. Traditional IRA—With this type of account you generally get an upfront tax deduction for your contribution. Potential earnings grow tax deferred, but you're subject to ordinary income taxes when you make a withdrawal. If you withdraw money before age 59½, you may also be hit with a 10% penalty—all the more reason to give your money the opportunity to grow. Roth IRA—With a Roth, there's no up-front tax deduction, but you can withdraw potential earnings tax free at age 59½ if you've held the Roth for five years. You're subject to a 10% penalty if you withdraw earnings before 59½, but there's never a penalty for withdrawing the money you contributed. To contribute to a Roth IRA, you have to meet certain income limitations. In 2022, if you're married filing jointly, you can make a full contribution as long as your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is less than $204,000 (less than $129,000 for single filers). If you fall under the income limits and you don't need an upfront tax deduction, a Roth can be a good choice. And those tax-fee withdrawals could be a real plus if you're in a higher tax bracket down the road. Another opportunity for lower earners is the Saver's Credit, which gives you a tax credit for your retirement contribution if you meet certain income qualifications. You can check to see if you're eligible at irs.gov. It's easy to open an IRA at a bank or investment company—in person or online. Look for one that has a low account-opening minimum. And don't hesitate to ask questions. A representative should be happy to speak with you and make sure you understand the details. Setting up automatic contributions makes saving easy Once you've opened your IRA, set up a monthly automatic deposit from your checking account to your IRA. A $6,000 yearly contribution comes out to $500 a month. If that's more than you can manage, contribute as much as you can and try to add to it with any bonuses, raises, or gifts. You actually have until the tax filing date of the following year to make your full IRA contribution. Check your other options To me, an IRA is a smart and simple way to get started, but there are a couple of other ways to save depending on your circumstances: If you're self-employed—SEP and SIMPLE IRAs and Individual 401(k)s offer sole proprietors and small business owners a way to increase the amount of money they can contribute to retirement each year. Each is relatively easy to set up, has higher contribution limits, and offers a lot of flexibility. If you have a high-deductible health plan—If your health plan has a high annual deductible ($1,400 for individuals, $2,800 for families in 2022), you may qualify for a Health Savings Account (HSA). Similar to an IRA, an HSA lets you make annual contributions and offers significant tax perks. It's a way to save for current healthcare costs as well as for the future and can be a great complement to an IRA. If your state offers an auto-IRA—Several states have recently implemented retirement programs to help workers save, including auto-IRAs, retirement marketplaces, and multi-employer plans. Auto-IRAs require employers who don't offer retirement plans to automatically enroll their employees in a Roth IRA and deduct contributions directly from their paychecks, similar to a 401(k). Workers can decide to opt out once enrolled. Some programs are entirely voluntary for workers. Check to see what type of retirement savings program your state may offer if you don't have one at work. Don't just save—invest The next step is to get your money working. Since you're young and there are many years until you retire, I suggest investing in one or more broad-based stock mutual funds or exchange traded funds that represent different companies, industries and countries. Or you could invest in what's called a target date fund that corresponds to your retirement date. When you open your IRA, talk to the representative about investment choices and advice services. Many financial service companies offer free education and guidance. Save even more You and your husband probably have savings goals beyond retirement, so as your income grows, consider putting even more away in a taxable account. And don't forget about an emergency fund, which is an essential buffer against all of the unexpected events that can crop up! That way, you'll not only be saving for your individual retirements, but you'll also be planning and saving for a more secure financial future together. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'Stay on budget and enjoy your vacation.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Travel budgets are under pressure. On one hand, high demand for flights, car rentals, and cruises is pushing prices up, according to AAA, as Americans hit the road in ever-greater numbers. On the other, historically high levels of inflation have made for eye-watering increases in food and fuel costs. However, that doesn\\'t mean you have to spend the summer at home. Careful planning can help you make more of your travel dollars. \"Your vacation doesn\\'t have to be expensive to be memorable,\" says Chris Kawashima, senior financial planning research analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"There are many ways to save money, and none of them make the experiences any less special.\" Here are five ways to help keep travel costs down. 1. Go off-peak You can save a lot of money if you can travel when others (think families on a school calendar) cannot. The prices of not just airplane tickets but also hotels and rental cars vary significantly based on demand. Think weekdays versus busy weekends. If you want to be really contrarian, go to a summer resort destination in the fall, or head to a ski mountain to go hiking in the summer. 2. Buy early Planning a trip can be fun on its own—and if you\\'re thoughtful, you can also save money in the process. Although you\\'ll have a greater selection when airlines first publish fares, the price tends to fall in the months leading up to departure. A 2022 survey by CheapAir.com found that flyers get the best ticket prices around two and a half months ahead of their travel date but no more than three months prior (even booking nearly a year in advance was more costly). But don\\'t wait too long: Airfares also tend to climb fast in the weeks right before departure. 3. Be adventurous If you favor experiences over expensive indulgences, you may come away with a more memorable vacation, Chris says. Camping in a beautiful park may cost less than a hotel in ho-hum surroundings. The travel industry likes to market luxury, but good company can make any meal or outing more fun—no matter how much you spend. Your vacation doesn\\'t have to be the occasion for your most expensive meal of the year. 4. Mind the fees The revenue airlines collect for something other than flying you from point A to point B has quadrupled over the past decade. Ancillary revenue—including fees for baggage, extra legroom, onboard food and beverage sales, boarding early, and other niceties—earned U.S. and Canadian airlines more than $24 billion in 2021. Minimizing those charges can save a lot. Review the fine print, and if you travel frequently, it may be worthwhile to use a travel-focused credit card that covers first-bag fees or offers other perks. Similarly, you may be offered add-ons at the rental car counter—ranging from satellite radio to enhanced roadside assistance—that you don\\'t need. Optional rental car insurance may be redundant if your credit card or auto policy already provides it. Finally, if you need to withdraw cash during your trip, try to find an ATM owned by your bank. Non-bank ATM fees are another expense that can add up when you\\'re in an unfamiliar territory. Check with your bank to see if they have a policy for refunding fees. 5. Be flexible Be willing to go to the next town over from your destination for a cheaper hotel or fly at a less convenient time to cut money off the fare. Renting an apartment or cottage instead of a hotel has become much easier thanks to vacation-home rental services. Buying groceries and cooking for yourself instead of eating out for every meal can also save you quite a few dollars. Sometimes, \"living like a local\" can help save money and make your vacation more interesting. Finally, don\\'t fall into the trap of feeling like everything has to be perfect—no matter the expense—when you go on vacation. Travel experiences tend to get better in retrospect. \"When you look back on a trip, the less-than-perfect parts will fade away, and the good stuff will be what everyone remembers,\" Chris says.

       "   'content': 'Automated investing platforms, sometimes called “robo-advisors,” are becoming a familiar part of the investing landscape. Even so, many investors have questions about these services—and what the possible advantages of using them might be. In fact, an automated portfolio can play a number of potential roles in your financial plan. “Automated investing services are designed to be broadly applicable to a wide variety of investors and goals,” says David Koenig, chief investment strategist of multi-asset solutions for Schwab Asset Management Solutions. You can set up multiple accounts to invest for multiple goals—each with its own time horizon and risk profile. Automated investing overview As you’ve probably heard before, automated platforms are engineered to simplify the investing process. But robo-advisors are also known for providing diversified portfolios at low cost. Typically, you begin by filling out an online questionnaire that identifies your goals and time horizon and gauges your risk tolerance. Next, this information is run through an algorithm that recommends a portfolio of diverse assets. It may sound high-tech, but the portfolios and their underlying investments—often low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—are selected by investment professionals. Meanwhile, the automated features help streamline complex tasks like rebalancing (to make sure your desired allocation stays consistent over time); tax-loss harvesting (to help offset taxes on gains and income); and setting up a steady income stream in retirement. Here are five ways you might incorporate an automated investing service into your financial strategy. Keep in mind that you’ll usually set up an account to focus on a specific goal—so your answers to questions about your objective, time horizon, and risk tolerance need to pertain to that goal. Goal #1: Save for a second home Because an investing portfolio has more potential for higher returns than an ordinary savings account, it can help you work toward a longer-term goal like a second home. How you fill out the questionnaire will determine how conservative or aggressive the portfolio allocation recommended by the service will be, David notes. For example, if your time horizon is relatively short and you have a relatively low risk tolerance, your second-home fund could use a conservative allocation that emphasizes bonds and cash. By contrast, a more aggressive portfolio might include more stocks. Depending on your risk tolerance, the portion allocated to various asset classes may vary, but your portfolio would still have more potential for growth than a savings account. Of course, there are risks. Using an investment account would expose your savings to potential market volatility and investments could lose value. And even if your portfolio thrived, you could end up with capital gains and their attendant tax bill. However, the potential for higher returns and the automated nature of these accounts may still make them attractive vehicles. Goal #2: Save for college The go-to college savings vehicle for many Americans—the 529 plan—comes with some restrictions. But you may be able to work around these by using an automated portfolio. For example, you can’t use 529 plans to pay for education at certain institutions outside the United States. If your child’s heart is set on the Sorbonne, any distributions from the plan would not be considered a qualified withdrawal. If your child gets a scholarship and doesn’t need all the money you set aside in a 529, you can withdraw an equivalent amount from the 529 without paying the usual 10% penalty for nonqualified withdrawals—but you may still have to pay federal and state income tax on the gains in the account if you cannot use it for another child or other family member. If you put aside some college savings in an automated investing account, it may not grow tax-free as it would in a 529, but you’ll have more flexibility about how you spend the money. And when you liquidate, most of your gains will likely be taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains rate (depending on the timing of the deposits and withdrawals you made over the years), which is generally lower than the ordinary income tax rate. So although 529 plans remain a valuable—even essential—tool for college savings, it’s worthwhile to consider supplementary ways to save for expenses that a 529 plan won’t cover. Goal #3: Consider consolidating IRAs Could you use an automated portfolio as the mainstay of your retirement plan? Yes, David says—but you can also consider one for just part of your plan. Let’s say you have a 401(k) with your current employer, but you also have several IRAs you’ve accumulated over the years. Monitoring and rebalancing those IRAs individually can be a time-consuming task. “An investor might decide to roll all of her IRAs into one automated investing IRA to benefit from the automated monitoring and rebalancing,” David says. This can add a certain level of discipline to your plan, he notes. Goal #4: Organize your portfolio Once you’re in retirement, you might consider using an automated investment advisory platform as part of a “bucketing” strategy—separating out different portfolios for growth and for income generation. For example, you could open one account with a longer time horizon and higher risk tolerance for growth, while a second account could be more conservative and focused on generating income. The potential benefit here is that an automated plan would stay the course and rebalance to your target allocation, even when those decisions might be hard to make on your own. Goal #5: Generate steady income in retirement Taking income from a retirement portfolio can be one of the most challenging aspects of financial planning: Draw too much too soon, and you could deplete your savings faster than you can afford. Draw from the wrong assets, and your portfolio might not have enough growth potential to meet your future income needs. Fortunately, some automated portfolios enable you to create a personalized withdrawal strategy for a steady stream of income that helps you meet your retirement expenses. By setting your retirement income goal, the system can help monitor your portfolio and withdrawals so you stay on track. The personal touch Of course, some issues are too complex—or emotionally fraught—and require more personal guidance. “This type of service isn’t meant to replace estate or tax planning,” David says. It’s also not meant to replace the kind of ongoing, personal relationship you might have with someone you trust, who has come to know your individual needs and concerns over the course of a long relationship. That’s not to say you may not get the benefit of human experience with an automated investing platform. “Some offer investors access to financial professionals either via chat or by phone,” says David. The bottom line: If you’re looking for a low-cost, efficient, yet flexible way to invest and you’re comfortable with doing it all online, it might be time for you to log on. Whatever your financial goal—a comfortable retirement, graduate school for your son or daughter, or a new car—an automated investing service could help get you there.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Learn how to select exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are consistent with your investment strategies.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Almost every investment niche—from small-cap stocks to emerging markets or oil—can be fulfilled by a vast range of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). So how do you choose when you’re faced with many alternatives within the same fund categories? While every situation is unique, here are some guidelines to help you with your research. What do you want the ETF to do? First, make sure you\\'re not missing the forest for the trees. You\\'re not looking to just buy any ETF simply because you\\'ve heard that ETFs are great; you\\'re looking for exposure to international small-cap stocks, corporate bonds or a diversified basket of commodities, whatever part of the market you\\'d like to invest in. Consider looking at a fund\\'s Morningstar Category and the actual holdings for a better understanding of what you’re buying. ETFs that initially seem similar may actually be very different. Costs matter Once you\\'ve found some ETFs with the market exposure you\\'re seeking, look at their costs. You\\'ll want to think about three different types of ETF costs, and their relative importance depends on how you plan to use the ETF in your portfolio: Operating Expense Ratio (OER): This is the ongoing cost that the ETF manager charges for managing the portfolio. When people talk about ETFs having low costs, they\\'re usually referring to the OER. If you plan to hold the ETF for more than a year, this is probably the most important cost. Bid-ask spread: Whenever you buy or sell anything on an exchange, the price you get will be determined in part by market makers—traders who stand ready to buy and sell a specific stock or ETF all day long. They\\'ll be willing to sell you shares at one price (the \"ask,\" or \"offer\" price) and buy shares from you at a slightly lower price (the \"bid\" price). Whenever you trade, you\\'re basically losing half of the bid-ask spread, since you either buy at the higher bid price or sell at the lower ask price. If you plan to hold an ETF for less than a year, this cost can matter more than the OER. Commission: Because ETFs trade intraday like stocks, your broker may charge you a commission for each trade. The smaller your investment and the more frequently you trade, the more important the commission. \\u200b\\u200bMany brokers, including Schwab, no longer charge commissions for online ETF trades, but if you do use a broker that charges ETF commissions, be sure to factor those into your cost analysis.1 When analyzing ETFs, consider the OER and bid-ask spread, and the amount of time you think you will hold the ETF. Here\\'s a general formula for calculating the annual total cost of ownership: To illustrate, for an ETF with an OER of 0.10%, a bid-ask spread of 0.15% and a six-month holding period, the annual total cost of ownership is 0.40% per year: Check the track record Once you\\'ve found the lowest-cost ETFs that meet your needs, and assuming they\\'ve been around long enough to have established a history, take a look at their track records. Has an ETF succeeded in gathering assets? If an ETF doesn\\'t have at least $20 million under management, it might eventually be closed by its sponsor. Is there reasonable trading volume? If an ETF is very thinly traded, it\\'s more likely to have wider bid-ask spreads. Does the performance of an index ETF closely match the index it\\'s aiming to track? To measure an index ETF\\'s tracking error relative to its underlying index, look at the ETF\\'s most recent annual or semi-annual report.These reports will generally include a chart that shows the performance of the ETF versus the index. Ideally, the two lines on the chart should remain very close to one another throughout the fund\\'s history. Are there are significant periods where the ETF outperforms or underperforms the index? This could be a sign that the ETF manager is struggling to match the index portfolio. ETF outperformance could also indicate that the manager is generating additional revenue for the fund through securities lending. Consider the structure Stock and bond funds function fairly similarly to one another and are typically regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Commodity ETFs, however, have more structural issues to consider: Commodity ETFs that hold a physical commodity such as precious metals are usually structured as Grantor Trusts. Gains are taxed as collectibles at a rate of up to 28%, though fund managers do not issue K-1 statements. Commodity ETFs that hold futures contracts are often structured as Limited Partnerships. These funds report shareholders\\' partnership income on Schedule K-1 instead of Form 1099. K-1s can be more complex to handle on a tax return than 1099s, but professional tax preparers or well-informed individuals who do their own taxes should be able to handle them correctly. Generally funds that hold futures contracts must also periodically replace contracts that are close to expiration with longer-dated contracts. ETFs which track indexes containing exclusively near-term futures contracts will typically have higher turnover than ETFs tracking indexes which contain a broader range of contract maturities. As a result, “contango” (when the near-term contract that is being sold has a lower price than the longer-dated contract that is being purchased) can potentially have a bigger impact on these funds. Newer commodity ETFs that hold futures contracts may be structured as actively managed ’40 Act Funds. The futures contracts in these funds are held in offshore subsidiaries (often in the Cayman Islands) to avoid violating SEC rules pertaining to \"qualified\" investments for open-end mutual funds. The dividends generated by the subsidiaries are considered to be “qualified” (despite their “non-qualified” origin) thereby allowing these funds to avoid structuring as limited partnerships and distributing K-1s. Although technically “active” ETFs, these funds often hew closely to an index with limited active management of the funds’ cash collateral. ETFs with portfolios comprised of over 25% master limited partnerships (companies which are typically involved in the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas, coal and other commodities) are required to withhold and pay corporate income taxes. Due to the withholding and payment of taxes, these funds may appear to have high tracking error vs. their underlying indexes (since the indexes do not account for the tax effects). Also, the net expense ratios for these funds usually include an estimate of the annual tax impact in addition to the management fee earned by the fund’s sponsor. Some ETF sponsors now offer ETFs that limit MLP holdings to under 25% of their portfolios in order to avoid incurring C-corp taxation. Consider the firm As with any investment, due diligence is important. You want to pick ETFs with strong companies behind them, just as you would with a mutual fund. Stable management and a clean record with regulators are what you\\'re looking for, so check the latest news or SEC filings on ETF companies you\\'re considering. Strategy for Choosing an ETF: A Process Flow Chart ETF investing strategy summary—bringing it all together Choosing among the multitude of ETFs that exist in many categories can be a little tricky, but sticking to a few basic tenets can help. You\\'ll note that \"highest past performance\" was not on the list of criteria for picking an ETF—your investment decision should be driven by your future goals, not past performance. 1 ETFs at Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (“Schwab”) can be traded without a commission on buy and sell transactions made online in a Schwab account. Schwab does not receive payment to promote any particular ETF to its customers. Schwab\\'s affiliate Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (\"CSIM\") serves as investment advisor to the Schwab ETFs™, which compensate CSIM out of the applicable operating expense ratios. The amount of the fees is disclosed in the prospectus of each ETF. Schwab receives remuneration from active semi-transparent ETFs or their sponsors for platform support and technology, shareholder communications, reporting, and similar administrative services for active semi-transparent ETFs available at Schwab. This fee will vary, but typically is an asset-based fee of 0.10% per annum of the assets held at Schwab.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I need a new car. My current car is nine years old and on its last legs. I bought it used and was going to do the same thing this time around, but I’m also tempted by a new car because of the safety features. My budget is pretty tight though, so I\\'m not sure if I can even afford a new car. Any advice? —A Reader Dear Reader, No matter how you look at it, getting a new car is both expensive and confusing. Expensive in part because of supply shortages for new and used vehicles. The average new car now costs nearly $40,000 (yes, that\\'s right). And confusing because once you have a good sense of the type of car you want, you still have to figure out the best way to pay for it. Used or new? Purchase or lease? Purchase outright or finance over time? These are complicated decisions, with lots of variables to consider. But it’s worth it to proceed carefully because your decision will have a big impact not only on your immediate out-of-pocket cost, but also on your monthly budget and ability to fund other important goals. Before you sign on the dotted line, it\\'s critical to understand that your costs are more than just the purchase price. The total costs of owning and operating an automobile include fuel, maintenance, repairs, tires, insurance, license, registration and taxes, and potentially financing costs. And money doesn\\'t necessarily tell the whole story. Some people value cars more than others. For them, owning a newer or fancier car is worth sacrificing in other areas. Like so many other purchasing decisions, selecting a car comes down to a mix of financial as well as non-financial criteria. Let\\'s take a look at your major decision points and hopefully steer you in the right direction. Used versus new Whether buying used or new is \"better\" depends on your situation. From a pure cost perspective, paying cash for a gently used two- to three-year-old vehicle and driving it for several years is a pretty sensible strategy. This is due in large part to depreciation, or the reduction in resale value over time. In fact, depreciation is one of biggest expenses when buying a new car. The particulars vary depending on a car\\'s make and model, but in general, new cars depreciate quickly (often more than 20 percent in year one), then taper down after the first three years. In contrast, used cars generally don’t decline in value as fast. On the other hand, newer cars tend to be safer, break down less often, and be more fuel efficient (or don\\'t use fuel at all in the case of electric vehicles). A used car may be cheaper up front but may require more repairs not covered by warranty. Financing deals are also better for new cars (lower interest rates) than for used cars. In other words, there\\'s no one-size-fits-all answer. The best advice I can give you is to look beyond the initial purchase price and focus instead on the total costs of owning the car for several years. Buying versus leasing Nearly one-third of individuals lease these days, primarily because leasing gives you access to a newer or nicer car that you may not otherwise be able to afford. The way I think of leasing is that you’re paying to drive the car, not own it. It can be a good option for those who can afford it and are okay with returning the car (or buying it) when the lease is up. That said, the longer you plan to be in the vehicle and the more you drive, the more it makes sense to buy. Over time, the cost of leasing several cars will likely exceed the purchase price of a new or used car. Leasing can also lead you to spend more money on an expensive car rather than getting something more practical—and saving the difference. Financing Paying cash for a car isn\\'t practical for most households. The average amount financed for a new car is about $34,000; nearly $21,000 for a used car. Average monthly car payments are about $550 for a new car and $400 for a used car. Low interest rates and auto manufacturer\\'s aggressive efforts to improve sales have led to increased offers of 72- and 84-month financing. These long commitments can dramatically bring down monthly payments, but it worries me that people are thinking more about a monthly payment rather than the total cost of ownership. You can quickly wind up upside down (where a car is worth less than you owe on it) leaving you with years left to pay on an unwanted vehicle that isn\\'t worth much. New or used, if you\\'re financing a purchase try to follow these guidelines: The best financing deals go to people with the best credit scores. Get a free copy of your credit report at annualcreditreport.com. If your credit score has a few dings, take steps to improve it before you seek financing. Shop around and get pre-approved. You can check with the dealer, but you might also want to check with your credit union or local bank. Concentrating your applications in a short period of time can minimize the effect on your credit score. Avoid going out more than 36-60 months. A longer contract may have lower monthly payments, but your total cost will almost always be higher. Put at least 10-20 percent down. The ideal down payment wouldn\\'t drain your emergency savings but would be big enough to help you save money on interest since you\\'re borrowing less. And keep in mind that a trade-in can serve as your down payment if it has enough value. Avoid rolling over payments from your current car to your next car. A dealer may present this as an easy solution, but it\\'s a bad start for a new loan. A word of caution: The amount you qualify to borrow may be more than what you can really afford when you consider all your financial goals. When you borrow, it\\'s not just money that you\\'re borrowing from a bank. In a way, you\\'re borrowing from your future. Take time to think hard about this before you sign the dotted line on any loan. Putting all the pieces together Just like there\\'s no \"one\" car for every person, there isn\\'t one best way to buy a car. Your financial situation, goals and priorities all play a role. So do some soul-searching, and crunch your numbers carefully. If you understand the total costs of ownership, and how the purchase will impact other areas of your life, you\\'re well on your way to making the best decision. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': 'It may be better to give than to receive—but what about to lend? Many well-off individuals choose to extend a helping hand to family members, be it a down payment on a new home, a bridge loan when times turn tough, or even an advance on an inheritance. But how they give can be as consequential as how much. That\\'s because of the potential tax implications that depend on whether such financial assistance comes in the form of a family loan—to be paid back at a later date, with interest—or an outright gift. And while loans are often seen as furthering financial discipline, gifts may be less likely to foster conflict because—by definition—they often come without formal strings attached. So, which method is right for your family and under what circumstances? Start by considering the following. Gifts Gifts of $16,000 or less per recipient fall under the annual \"gift exclusion\" for tax purposes. If your gift exceeds that amount, you must report it to the IRS on Form 709. That doesn\\'t necessarily mean you\\'ll owe taxes on it, thanks to the lifetime gift tax exemption, which is the total amount you can give away tax-free during your life. The current gift and estate tax exemption for 2022 is $12.06 million per individual (U.S. residents only) under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA). This amount is indexed for inflation through December 31, 2025, when it would decrease by 50% under current law. \"If you have significant means, and you\\'re primarily concerned with your tax exposure, then it may be prudent to give money or other assets to family members before this window closes, and clients should be meeting with their attorneys now,\" says Chris Borzych, a Schwab wealth strategist in San Antonio, Texas. In addition, if you have appreciable assets that have decreased in value, you may want to consider gifting them now rather than later. In doing so, any future appreciation would occur in the recipient\\'s estate. \"For many individuals, estate taxes haven\\'t been a concern with the high $12.06 million exemption, which is effectively doubled for a married couple,\" Chris explains. \"With the likely reduction of these exemptions in 2026, making transfers out of one\\'s estate will become a significantly more important planning strategy for us all.\" Furthermore, in November 2019, the IRS issued final regulations to the TCJA that provided a special rule allowing the taxpayer\\'s estate to calculate the estate tax credit using the higher of either the basic exclusion amount of gifts over a lifetime or the current exemption amount at the time of the taxpayer\\'s death. Therefore, taxpayers who take advantage of the increased exemptions before 2026 don\\'t have to worry about losing the tax benefit of the higher exclusion levels if they\\'re reduced. But recently, the IRS has sought to limit these \"anti-clawback\" rules. It is imperative that you speak with a qualified tax consultant to fully evaluate this exemption planning. Gifts are simply outright transfers of assets during your life with annual exclusions and the added benefit of lifetime exemptions. Sometimes, individuals may expect the recipient to pay back the money, want to earn income from an asset, or have even exceeded their lifetime gift exemptions. When this is the case, then gifting your money may not be the right answer. Loans For those who don\\'t want to give an outright gift, an intrafamily loan—which can encourage fiscal discipline in the form of regular repayments—is another way to go. \"A family loan can provide support for family and income for the lender,\" Chris suggests. Before you extend a loan to family, however, be aware that it\\'s not as simple as just writing a check. The IRS mandates that any loan between family members be made with a signed written agreement, a fixed repayment schedule, and a minimum interest rate. (The IRS publishes Applicable Federal Rates (AFRs) monthly.) \"There are many strategies that take advantage of the difference between the relatively low AFR rates, which are currently around 3.35% for long term (See \"All in the Family,\" below), and the earnings rate a portfolio could potentially earn over time. This may allow a gift and estate tax-free transfer of wealth to family,\" Chris says. Should you fail to charge an adequate interest rate, the IRS could tax you on the interest you could\\'ve collected but didn\\'t. What\\'s more, if the loan exceeds $10,000 or the recipient of the loan uses the money to produce income (such as using it to invest in stocks or bonds), you\\'ll need to report the interest income on your taxes. There\\'s also the question of delinquency to consider. When a family member can\\'t repay a loan, the lender rarely reports it to a credit bureau, never mind a collection agency. However, should the lender want to deduct a bad loan on her or his taxes, the IRS requires proof of an attempt to collect the delinquent funds. Conversely, if the lender wants to forgive the loan, the unpaid amount will be treated as a gift for tax purposes. Then, the borrower may owe taxes on the remaining unpaid interest. (The rules are even more complicated if the loan is considered a private mortgage, so it\\'s best to consult a qualified tax advisor or financial planner before finalizing the details.) \"You should not attempt to disguise a gift as a loan,\" Chris warns. \"An intrafamily loan needs to have a formal structure or else the IRS will consider it a gift. This may be a significant issue if you\\'ve already used your lifetime gift exemption and, if so, may trigger an immediate tax. \"With the current unified estate tax and gift tax exemption limits of $12.06 million, this is often not an issue. But when the gift tax exemption is lowered in 2026, this could be significantly more problematic,\" Chris cautions. Be that as it may, lending a large sum to a family member can help her or him save a tidy sum in interest payments over the life of the loan. All in the family Intrafamily loans, which can be offered at rates lower than those for mortgage and personal loans, can help borrowers save big on interest. 1 IRS.gov, August 2022 rate as of 08/2022. Total interest paid assumes a fixed interest rate compounded annually and a loan term of nine or more years. 2 Bankrate.com, average rate as of 08/08/22. Total interest paid assumes a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage and a 20% down payment. 3 Bankrate.com, average rate as of 07/20/2022. Total interest paid assumes a fixed interest rate and a credit score from 720 to 850. Examples provided are for illustrative purposes only and not intended to be reflective of results you can expect to achieve. For estate-planning purposes, you might consider using an intentionally defective grantor trust (IDGT) along with a large intrafamily loan, especially if the beneficiary is your child or grandchild. Don\\'t be thrown off by the name. The defect is a tool used to allow greater family transfers by taking advantage of the differences in income tax law and gift and estate law. With an IDGT, you can transfer assets to the trust by gift or sale. Gifting an asset could trigger a gift tax on any capital gains. On the other hand, selling an asset can be structured as a loan where you could charge a low interest rate. You won\\'t owe taxes on the interest income, and the assets will grow tax-free. You must, however, continue paying taxes on all income produced by the IDGT each year. The trust assets won\\'t be included in the value of your estate, thus lowering your taxable estate and allowing your beneficiary to avoid gift taxation. Using an IDGT in conjunction with an intrafamily loan is complex. Seek the advice of an estate planning attorney, and reach out to a Schwab wealth strategist to determine if this strategy is right for you. Family dynamics In the end, whether to give a gift or extend a loan may come down to the strength of your familial relationships and the nature of the individuals involved. \"When developing the right strategy for unique family situations, individual circumstances must be recognized,\" Chris says. \"Both gifts and loans have a purpose and should be used in an overall strategy. Often, strategies use both to accomplish a client\\'s wealth-transfer goal.\" Whichever path you take, communication is key, particularly when setting expectations.'},\n",

In this article, we’ll discuss the benefits and trade-offs of an ETF-only portfolio using index ETFs.

As a general rule, ETFs provide excellent diversification at a low ongoing expense ratio (OER) since many are passive funds that track a certain benchmark index. Because of this, they typically offer transparency—it’s easy to see what stocks, bonds, or other investments the ETF holds each day. If these are top characteristics you look for in your investments, owning nothing but ETFs may be a straightforward yet flexible solution worth a closer look. There are some trade-offs to think through. An all-ETF portfolio means giving up actively managed mutual funds, which have the potential to outperform index ETFs through professional selection of stocks and bonds. You\\'ll also leave behind the control that comes with a portfolio composed solely of individual securities you have selected. Some people won’t want to give these things up, even though these approaches have specific disadvantages as well (see table below). A portfolio of index mutual funds, meanwhile, would be very similar to an all- ETF portfolio with two main exceptions: ETFs trade differently than index mutual funds, and for certain niche asset classes, you can find ETFs but very few or no index mutual funds. Pros and cons of four types of portfolios relative to each other Pros and cons of four types of portfolios relative to each other Portfolio Pros Cons Portfolio Actively managed mutual funds > Pros Professional active managementPotential to outperform the marketDiversified well among various securities Largest number of fund choices > Cons Higher ongoing expenses Possible underperformance Least transparent Higher portfolio turnover > Portfolio Index mutual funds > Pros Diversified well among various securitiesGenerally low ongoing expense Seeks to match index performance (minus fees and expenses) > Cons Limited selection in certain asset classes No active management No potential to beat the index > Portfolio All-Index ETF portfolio > Pros Diversified very well among various securities Generally low ongoing expenses Niche options available if desired Transparency at end of day Trading flexibility Seeks to match index performance (minus fees and expenses) > Cons No active management No potential to beat the index > Portfolio Individual stocks and bonds > Pros No ongoing management expenses Maximum control Complete transparency > Cons Higher transaction costs Diversification can be more difficult No professional management Certain types of bonds may have low liquidity (for individual bonds) > If you think an all-ETF portfolio might suit you, here are three ways to build one, ranging from ultra-simple to very fine-tuned. 1. Keeping it simple One option you can consider would be using two ETFs to help provide a balanced, diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds: A total world stock market ETF A total bond market ETF For instance, if you\\'re an investor seeking moderate risk and decide that you want 60% of your portfolio in stocks and 40% in bonds, you could consider purchasing an all-country stock index ETF and then combine it with a bond ETF. World stock market ETFs may track an index like the Morgan Stanley Capital International All Country World IndexSM (MSCI ACWI), which provides exposure to U.S. stocks, developed-market international stocks and emerging-market international stocks. Some bond ETFs track the broad Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index, which covers: Treasury bonds Government-agency bonds Mortgage-backed bonds Investment-grade corporate bonds Some dollar-denominated international bonds The advantage of this type of portfolio is its simplicity: one stock fund and one bond fund. It will be easy to see when you need to rebalance. Plus, because ETFs trade intraday and generally cost part of the bid-ask spread every time you buy or sell, a two-ETF portfolio can help keep your trading costs low. One disadvantage of this portfolio is that it’s not very fine-tuned. For instance, as of March 31, 2021, MSCI ACWI had about 58% in U.S. stocks and 42% in non-US stocks, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International. If you prefer to have a larger allocation to U.S. stocks, for example, you might want two separate stock ETFs. Another drawback to this portfolio is that it lacks any allocation to Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), sub-investment grade bonds (also known as high yield or junk bonds), and non-dollar-denominated international bonds, not to mention other asset classes such as commodities and real estate. Additional asset classes can help further diversify your portfolio. Still, if simplicity is what you seek, the two-ETF portfolio can be an alternative worth considering. 2. Middle of the road An intermediate approach to an all-ETF portfolio could consist of about 10 ETFs. For stocks, you could have: A large-cap U.S. ETF A small-cap U.S. ETF An international developed-market ETF An emerging-market ETF For bonds, you could start with the same core bond ETF described above and diversify further by including ETFs that invest in: TIPS Sub-investment grade (\"high-yield\" or \"junk\") bonds International bonds The advantage of this portfolio can help provide balance. It has enough ETFs to give you coverage of more asset classes and the ability to adjust your portfolio weights in most areas, but not so many funds that it becomes too challenging to keep track. The disadvantage of this portfolio is that it offers neither maximum simplicity nor maximum customizability. 3. Fine-tuned On the other end of the spectrum from an ultra-simple ETF portfolio is a fine-tuned portfolio with 20 or more ETFs. This type of portfolio can make sense for investors who like to allocate their accounts toward exactly the parts of the market they expect to perform best. This portfolio begins similarly to the middle-of-the-road ETF portfolio but then divides the various parts into thinner slices: U.S. large-cap stocks can be divided into sectors such as financials and health care, or even narrower industries such as banks and biotech. The U.S. stock allocation can further be divided to include mid-cap or micro-cap stocks, or styles such as growth and value. The international stock allocation can be adjusted to include international small-cap stocks in regions, such as Europe and Asia or in individual countries like Germany and China. The core bond index can be broken into its components: Treasuries Agency-backed bonds Mortgage-backed securities Corporate bonds The average maturity of the bonds in the portfolio can be fine-tuned to include more long-term bonds or short-term bonds. Commodity ETFs can be added to the portfolios, and split into fine slices such as: Oil Gold Agricultural commodities Base metals Real estate ETFs can be added to the portfolio and could even be split into U.S. and global. With the fine-tuned portfolio, it’s unlikely that you would want to hold every possible ETF at the same time. For instance, rather than holding allocations to all 11 stock sectors and every individual country possible, you would likely have core allocations to certain ETFs, and then add weight to the ETFs representing only those sectors or countries that appear most attractive. The advantage of this portfolio is the ability to get almost exactly the exposure you want to each narrow piece of the market while still enjoying the diversification that ETFs offer over individual stocks and bonds. The disadvantages are complexity and trading costs. With so many ETFs in the portfolio, it’s important to be able to keep track of what you own at all times. You could easily lose sight of your total allocation to stocks if you hold 13 different stock ETFs instead of one or even five. In addition, with so many ETFs in the portfolio and relatively more buying and selling, the impact of bid-ask spreads could add up quickly. We can help you get started with ETFs.

Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor\\'s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV). All ETFs are subject to management fees and expenses. Please see Charles Schwab Pricing Guide for additional information. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed income investments are subject to various other risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The lower rated securities in which high yield funds invest are subject to greater credit risk, default risk and liquidity risk. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are inflation-linked securities issued by the U.S. government whose principal value is adjusted periodically in accordance with the rise and fall in the inflation rate. Thus, the dividend amount payable is also impacted by variations in the inflation rate as it is based upon the principal value of the bond. It may fluctuate up or down. Repayment at maturity is guaranteed by the U.S. government and may be adjusted for inflation to become the greater of either the original face amount at issuance or that face amount plus an adjustment for inflation. TIPS generally have lower yields than conventional fixed rate bonds and will likely decline in price during periods of deflation, which could result in losses. International investments involve additional risks, which include differences in financial accounting standards, currency fluctuations, geopolitical risk, foreign taxes and regulations, and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks. Small-cap stocks have historically been more volatile than the stocks of larger more established companies. Sector investing may involve a greater degree of risk than an investment with broader diversification. Commodity-related products, including futures, carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Commodity-related products may be extremely volatile, illiquid and can be significantly affected by underlying commodity prices, world events, import controls, worldwide competition, government regulations and economic conditions, regardless of the length of time shares are held. Investments in commodity-related products may subject the fund to significantly greater volatility than investments in traditional securities and involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. Risks of real estate investment trusts (REITs) are similar to those associated with direct ownership of real estate, such as changes in real estate values and property taxes, interest rates, cash flow of underlying real estate assets, supply and demand and the management skill and credit worthiness of the issuer. Investing in REITs may pose additional risks, such as real estate industry risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs and expenses and cannot be invested in directly. Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, Inc., is an affiliate of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.

       "   'abstract': 'Having a child is a big financial decision. Needing fertility treatments means even more careful financial planning.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My wife and I are facing some big decisions. We've been told we'll need fertility treatments to have a baby, but the costs seem overwhelming. How can we decide if we can afford it? —A Reader Dear Reader, Deciding to have a child is a big financial decision no matter the circumstances. Your situation will likely take even more careful financial planning—along with a lot of patience and perseverance. Infertility isn't uncommon in the U.S. Recent statistics indicate 1 in 8 couples need treatments to help them conceive. And as you say, the costs can seem overwhelming. For instance, the average cost for one cycle of in vitro fertilization (IVF) is around $10-$15,000, and more than one cycle is usually needed. Of course, this is a personal journey, so the first thing to do is work with your doctor to understand the types of treatments you may need and the possible cost. Often your doctor or clinic can provide some ballpark estimates of likely costs as well as initial information on financial resources. Then get ready to dig deep. Because while there may be financial help available—from insurance to employee benefits to grants and scholarships—it often takes a lot of time and effort to sort out your options. Start with your health insurance coverage This can be tricky. Many policies cover certain types of fertility treatments but not others. And while currently 19 states have passed fertility insurance coverage laws, those laws vary state by state. So first check to see what is mandated by your state. Then talk to your insurance provider to get the specifics of your plan. Don't hesitate to ask questions. For instance, are all fertility treatments covered or just some? If fertility treatments aren't covered per se, what about visits to a specialist, testing or medications? Are there limits on the number of treatments? Coverage maximums? Does your employer offer another plan with better coverage? If your current insurance policy comes up short, you could explore changing insurance providers. Or if you're both covered at work, could one of you switch to the other's insurance if it offered more? But this too can be tricky. While policies under the ACA cover pre-existing conditions, small and independent insurance companies may not, and infertility can be considered a pre-existing condition. Also, specific enrollment periods generally apply, and there may be a waiting period when you switch policies. My best advice is to assume nothing. Get the details. Make sure you understand them. And get them in writing. Check your employee benefits If you’re covered by a work policy, also check with your HR department to make sure you haven’t overlooked any benefits. While fertility benefits may not be common, the number of companies offering them is growing, especially large companies according to FertilityIQ. In the past, tech industries were the leaders in offering this type of benefit, but other sectors are joining in as it becomes more important to potential employees. Again, benefits vary, with some companies offering fertility assistance to heterosexual couples, singles as well as the LGBTQ community. Ask about types of procedures covered, copays, restrictions and lifetime maximums. Here too, get the details—and in writing. Look into financial assistance opportunities You might be surprised to learn that a number of nonprofits offer grants and scholarships to help with fertility expenses. Each organization has its own individual criteria such as state residency, income limits and insurance coverage, but it could be well worth the effort to research what's available and the qualifications. Explore financing options Even if you have coverage through some or all of the above sources, be prepared for potentially high out-of-pocket expenses. Here are some other financing options: Health Savings Account (HSA)—If you have a high-deductible health insurance policy with an HSA, you can use the funds to pay for qualified medical expenses, including fertility treatments. An HSA is a good way to save in advance. Plus there are several tax advantages, and unused funds roll over year to year. HELOC—Although interest on a home equity line of credit is no longer tax deductible except for home improvements, you can use the money however you please. Though not without risk, a HELOC is generally lower interest than other forms of credit. IVF loans—This is a type of personal loan specifically for fertility treatments. There are lenders that specialize in fertility financing, and some clinics partner with lenders to create payment plans. Qualification and terms vary so it's important to comparison shop. Resolve.org is a good place to begin your search along with talking to your health care provider 401(k) loan—While I generally counsel against borrowing from retirement accounts, your employer plan may allow a 401(k) loan. But understand that it typically must be paid back within 5 years—sooner if you lose your job—and penalties and taxes can apply if you default. On the plus side, rates are generally low and there are no credit checks. Your family—Would prospective grandparents or other family members be able and willing to contribute through a gift or loan? You never know until you ask. And the return on their investment could be priceless. Credit cards—This is generally the least attractive option. But if you need a short-term financing solution—say a few thousand dollars to handle an insurance deductible—and have examined other options, look for a low- or even no-interest card and have a plan to pay it off as soon as possible. Be honest about the commitment you're willing to make We're talking about money here—but so much more. So be completely honest with yourself and each other as you gather information and explore your options. Having a child may be your top priority, but think hard about how much you’re willing and able to extend yourselves, and how much you’re willing to compromise other goals. Costs and success rates vary wildly for different treatments and individuals, so try to remain realistic at the same time that you pursue your ultimate dream of parenthood. Then you’ll be ready—financially and emotionally—for whatever the future brings. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'Should you take a lump-sum pension payout, or a monthly income stream for life? How to decide.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Does your employer offer a traditional defined-benefit pension plan that provides you a monthly payment for life when you retire? If so, congratulations—such plans are far less common today. With a pension, you may face a challenging choice at—or in—retirement: Should you take a one-time lump-sum payout or opt to receive a monthly annuity payment for the rest of your life and, in some cases, the life of your spouse or beneficiaries as well? If you choose the annuity route, the decision can become more perplexing when payment options vary. Here are a few examples: Single life payment: This typically pays the highest monthly amount. When you die, there are no further payments to your beneficiaries. Single life with term certain: You receive a little less each month, but if you die before the specified term is over, payments continue to your beneficiaries for a preset number of years. 50% joint and survivor: You receive a lower monthly payment to make sure your surviving spouse gets monthly payments for his or her life that are equal to 50% of the original annuity payments. 100% joint and survivor: You receive an even lower monthly payment, but in return, your surviving spouse gets 100% of the original annuity payments for his or her life. Your decision can have major financial implications, so consult with a professional financial or retirement planner and chose carefully. Here are some important factors to consider. Your life expectancy The simplest analysis compares the monthly annuity payment offered with what you believe you could generate yourself by investing the lump sum at a similar level of risk. There are three critical assumptions in this analysis: an assumption about your life expectancy, the return on your investments, and the risk—or certainty—of the return on those investments. Life expectancy being the most important. As a general rule, people in good health or with good reason to believe they or their spouse will live beyond the average life expectancy may find the monthly payments, paid for life, more attractive than relying on their ability to extract income for the same uncertain time period from a portfolio, while those in poor health who don’t expect to live beyond the average may find more benefit from the lump-sum option. Example Imagine your company provides a pension, and offers you at age 65 a single life annuity of $1,470 per month ($17,640 per year) for life or a lump-sum payment of $300,000. At first glance the annuity may appear to be the clear winner, as $17,640 per year ($1,470 x 12 months) amounts to an annual payout of 5.9% on $300,000 ($17,640 ÷ $300,000 = 5.9%). You may conclude that 5.9% is hard to consistently get from investments without taking on significant risk. In order to do a more apples-to-apples comparison, however, you need to keep in mind that the annuity takes a total-return approach (meaning that it assumes you will use both principal and investment returns during retirement, leaving a zero balance) with built-in assumptions about how long you will live. The 5.9% “return” is a rate of payout from the $300,000, including a gradual payout of your $300,000 principal. It isn’t a rate of return. If, at age 65, you assume a life expectancy of 18 more years, then the annuity’s internal rate of return—a measure similar to the anticipated investment return—is around 0.6%. In other words, if you withdrew $17,640 per year in both investment earnings and principal on your $300,000 lump sum, you’d need to earn an annual return of 0.6% on average through retirement to make it last for 18 years. In fact, the $300,000 would last a little over 17 years even with a 0% return ($300,000 ÷ $17,640= 17). However, if you live longer than average, the internal rate of return on the annuity goes up. In this example, if the individual lived to age 90 (25 years) the rate of return needed from a portfolio would be 3.2%, and to age 95 (30 years) 4.1%. You may, or may not, be able to do better by investing. The internal rate of return isn\\'t a simple number to calculate, and it isn\\'t reported by an annuity or pension provider. You\\'ll need a computer or calculator—or to work with an advisor. The questions to ask are: How concerned are you about managing investments and payments yourself? How long do you expect you or your spouse will live? Do you have other investments in combination with, and in addition to, a pension or annuity, for a balance of protections and growth potential?

How long do you expect you or your spouse will live? Do you have other investments in combination with, and in addition to, a pension or annuity, for a balance of protections and growth potential? How long you actually live is one of the more significant risks faced by retirees. The longer you live beyond your actuarial life expectancy, the better the annuity option generally becomes because of the guaranteed lifetime payment. If you are in poor health, you may find the lump sum more attractive. You might also view a pension with the annuity option as a form of insurance to help manage the risk of outliving the lump sum as well as the uncertainty of market returns. Taking care of others If you have a spouse who will need support after you pass, consider whether you have other investments that can support a comfortable retirement for him or her. Otherwise, one of the survivor benefit options listed above can help their (and your) security and peace of mind. Tip Be sure to use a reasonable estimate of what your lump-sum investment might earn. Today, we think a hypothetical conservative portfolio of 20% equities, 50% bonds and 30% cash could grow about 2.5% on average annually over the long term, based on Schwab’s current 10-year capital market expectations.

This is a critical issue when considering whether to take the monthly payment or the lump sum and invest. Other factors: Income needs, taxes and more Here are some additional factors to consider. Current income needs: If you already have sufficient sources of retirement income (a large portfolio, Social Security, other forms of lifetime income including existing annuities, etc.), you could invest either your annuity payments or a lump sum for future use or include it in your gift and estate program. Risk: In retirement, reliability of cash flows can be important for many retirees. A steady monthly check regardless of what’s happening in the markets can be helpful. First, ask yourself, how much of your retirement income will depend on markets, and how much is guaranteed (for example, provided from Social Security, pension or other annuity)? Do you feel comfortable with this balance? If not, consider the annuity. If so, consider the lump sum. Credit quality: If choosing an annuity payout, check the credit rating of the annuity provider or pension fund. (The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, is a federal government agency that provides protection for certain pension participants in the private sector, but the protection is not unlimited.) Then consider the advantage of turning over the risk of investment performance for a portion of your retirement cash flow to others (subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the insurance company) rather than taking on all of that risk yourself. Inflation: Unless the annuity payment carries a cost-of-living adjustment, you’ll lose purchasing power over time. A lump sum could be invested to include a prudent allocation of equities and TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) to help assets have a better chance of keeping up with inflation. Or couple a pension with a portfolio of investments to provide a combination of both. Of course, doing so would involve taking on some market risk and doesn’t ensure that income will last for the life of the annuitant. Convenience: When your work paychecks stop, there’s something to be said for a monthly check that automatically arrives in your bank account, especially if you plan on doing things besides managing your portfolio during your retirement. Work with a financial advisor to implement a total-return strategy that generates income from your portfolio if you don’t want to do it yourself. Cost comparison: Managing a lump sum yourself likely involves some investment costs (management fees, transaction fees, etc.). Such costs are already factored into the annuity choice. You may want to do some comparison shopping for the income paid from several high-quality, low-cost providers for an equivalent lump sum and compare it to the annuity payment offered by your pension plan. Taxes: If you opt for a lump-sum payout, one option could be to roll it over to a traditional IRA and continue to defer taxes. If you take a lump sum and don’t roll it over, you’ll pay a large, single tax bill. Check to be sure a rollover is permitted, whether you could roll over the lump-sum into your employer’s retirement plan. Talk with a financial advisor and tax professional about the advantages and disadvantages of rollovers to an IRA. Gift and estate planning: Unless you choose a term certain or survivor benefit option, your annuity ceases when you die. A lump sum could be passed on to heirs, if a balance remains. Be sure to factor your gift and estate planning goals into any lump sum versus annuity decision, along with the additional factors above. What about both? You might choose to take a lump sum and then choose to use a portion of it to purchase a high-quality, immediate fixed annuity. One approach may be to aim to cover as much of your essential, fixed expenses as possible from Social Security or other forms of predictable and, if possible, guaranteed income sources. This baseline may include a pension or annuity. Annuity guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. For many retirees, having a baseline of income in place can increase comfort and confidence and help in managing other investments more flexibly. Consider your situation and tolerance for market, longevity and other retirement risks. For additional guidance and a plan for your retirement, consider all of your assets and potential income sources, including a pension, and how they’ll work together to support your retirement. ¹ Source: Charles Schwab Investment Advisory (CSIA) 2021 Model Portfolio Estimates.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, We're a young family that wants to travel safely and cost-effectively. Is buying an RV a good idea? And where should we start? —A Reader Dear Reader, If months of being cooped up at home have you dreaming of the open road, you’re not alone. Sales of recreational vehicles jumped 6% in 2020, with suppliers hustling to keep up with an even greater demand in 2021. Interestingly, owners are getting younger, with the under-45 crowd representing the fastest-growing segment of RV owners. Indeed, we’ve come a long way from tossing a cooler and a couple of sleeping bags in a VW bus (as a colleague of mine nostalgically recalls doing with her young family in the ’70s). Now we want a place to sleep in the wilderness and a modern office to take on the road. But as much as you might love the idea of “RVing,” the reality of owning and maintaining an RV could become a bit of a financial headache if you’re not careful. Here are a few things to consider before buying an RV. Be realistic about what you want Understanding how—and how often—you’ll use the RV will help you determine the type to buy. Are you looking for basic amenities or deluxe features? Do you need space for an office or additional guests? Most important, how much RV can you afford? From a used camper van to a state-of-the-art motor home, the differences in features and cost can be staggering; prices can range from several thousand dollars to well over $500,000. When you step aboard one of the new, completely decked-out models, you’ll be wowed. But remember: A brand-new RV, like any other vehicle, will likely lose a significant chunk of its value as soon as you drive it off the lot. So, before you open your wallet, take a deep breath and carefully evaluate your priorities. Don’t underestimate ongoing costs Let’s say you find the RV you want at a price you can handle. Have you thought about expenses beyond the purchase price? For example, the usual expenses that come with owning and driving a vehicle—gas, insurance, maintenance, registration, and repairs—could cost a lot more for an RV than they do a regular car or truck. Plus, having a large RV parked in your driveway may not sit well with the neighbors—and could even be against the rules in your neighborhood or city—so you may need to factor in storage costs, as well. You may think that what you’ll save on typical vacation expenses like airfare, hotel bills, and restaurants will balance out these additional costs, and that’s a good point. But be sure to also factor in campsite fees and related charges like propane. And with the recent popularity of RV travel, you may have to reserve your campsites well in advance—which can undercut the thrill of spontaneously hitting the road. If you plan to finance the purchase, also think about how much that loan will cost you over the long haul. Recent statistics show the average amount financed for an RV is $45,000, with terms typically ranging from five to 10 years—or as long as 20 years if your loan is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Choosing a longer-term loan can make the monthly payments more manageable, but it also means you’ll be paying more interest (see “Loan ranger,” below)—and rates for RV loans tend to be higher than those for auto loans. Loan Ranger A longer-term loan may make for more manageable monthly payments, but don’t overlook the true cost of such financing. Five-year loan 10-year loan Amount borrowed > Five-year loan $45,000 > 10-year loan $45,000 > Interest rate > Five-year loan 5.5% > 10-year loan 6% > Monthly payment > Five-year loan $860 > 10-year loan $500 > Interest paid over life of loan > Five-year loan $6,573 > 10-year loan $14,951 > Total cost > Five-year loan $51,573 > 10-year loan $59,951 > Disclosures Interest rates are hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only but are reflective of prevailing rates for five- and 10-year loans by borrowers with excellent credit as of 01/27/2021. Totals have been rounded to the nearest dollar. Don’t let your other goals take a back seat While I totally understand the allure of an RV, especially after the cabin fever we’ve all been experiencing, you should approach such a purchase as a financial decision like any other. Start by looking at your budget to see if and how it fits in—and remember, this is a want, not a need, and belongs on your nonessentials list. Next, ask yourself what short-term trade-offs you’ll have to make to handle this new expense. If you finance the vehicle, will it increase your debt load beyond a manageable level? More important, are there any long-term consequences to consider? If the cost of buying and maintaining an RV will leave your savings for other goals running low—especially when the goal is retirement—it may be best to hit the brakes. Try before you buy You don’t have to own an RV to experience life on the road. National rental companies and marketplaces (similar to Airbnb) can point you to a range of RVs for hire in your area. Renting could mean the trip of a lifetime and convince you that buying an RV is right for you. Or it may help you avoid a major case of buyer’s remorse down the road.

       "   'abstract': 'Three steps to determine if you’re prepared to weather an earlier-than-expected exit from the workforce.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Most of us have an age at which we’d like to stop working—but what if circumstances change and retirement comes early? According to a 2020 survey conducted by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, nearly half of retirees reported leaving the workforce earlier than anticipated. That said, just because early retirement isn’t part of your plan doesn’t mean it isn’t doable. So, how do you know if you’re adequately prepared for early retirement? Follow these steps to find out. Step 1: Review your finances To begin, ask yourself four questions: What are my expenses now? It can be helpful to split your current expenses into two categories: must-haves like groceries and housing, and nice-to-haves like eating out and travel. How will my expenses change in retirement? While some costs, such as payroll taxes and retirement contributions, will go away, others, particularly health care, are likely to increase. Also factor in the potential for major one-time expenses, such as a child’s wedding, a new car, or a roof replacement. And don’t overlook the cost of long-term care—which roughly 70% of retirees will require at some point in their lives, according to longtermcare.gov. What’s my potential income? Tally up income from pensions, Social Security, and any other nonportfolio sources. Subtract that number from your target annual income to determine how much money you’ll need to generate from your portfolio. For example, if you need $90,000 a year in income and expect to receive $40,000 from nonportfolio sources, you’ll need $50,000 from your portfolio to meet your spending needs. What about health care? If you’re no longer covered by your employer-sponsored health insurance, you’ll need coverage until you become eligible for Medicare at age 65. Health care can take a big bite out of your income, so make sure to compare all available options, including COBRA, private insurance, and your spouse’s plan, if available. You may also be eligible for discounted coverage through organizations such as AARP. Step 2: Assess your portfolio Now that you have a clear picture of your income needs, ask yourself three questions to help determine the overall strength of your portfolio: Am I prepared to weather a downturn? Having adequate short-term reserves can help you avoid having to make a portfolio withdrawal during a bear market. We suggest having enough cash on hand to cover a year’s worth of retirement expenses, plus another two to four years’ worth of spending needs in short-term investments such as certificates of deposit and Treasury bills. Is my withdrawal rate sustainable? Keep in mind the 4% rule, which says that withdrawing 4% of your portfolio in your first year of retirement—and adjusting that number annually for inflation—will give your portfolio a high probability of lasting 30 years. Thus, if you want to withdraw $50,000 in your first year, a $1.25 million portfolio ($50,000/0.04) has a good chance of seeing you through retirement. Be aware, however, that this rule is conservative and doesn’t account for fluctuations in spending or market performance. A financial planner can help you develop a retirement plan, including a personalized spending rate based on your needs and time frame. Is my asset allocation in line with my time horizon, risk capacity, and risk tolerance? Maintaining a diversified, balanced portfolio becomes even more important in retirement to help prevent taking on too much—or too little—risk. For example, if you’re facing a retirement that could last a decade longer than planned, holding more stocks in the early years will help guard against the risk of outliving your savings. Just be sure you take a more conservative approach with the money you’ll need to tap in the next few years. Striking a balance between short-term income needs and longer-term growth is critical in retirement. Step 3: Dig into the details Making the shift from saving to spending can be challenging under the best of circumstances. The key is to plan your retirement with as much detail as possible—as well as with the understanding that you can’t predict everything and will likely need to make changes as your needs come into focus. A planner can help you take a hard look at your finances and make the necessary adjustments to keep your retirement on track—no matter when it hits.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'How to curtail emotional biases and take a more considered approach to your trading decisions.',\n",
       "   'content': 'It can be difficult to keep our emotions from upending our decision-making—especially when we have money on the line. The problem is particularly acute for stock traders, who can often find themselves in emotionally charged situations with considerable sums at stake. Here’s how to take a clear-headed, more-considered approach to four potentially fraught trading situations. 1. You’re holding on to a loser Research has shown that losing money is roughly twice as painful, emotionally speaking, as gaining it is pleasurable—a psychological effect known as loss aversion. The fix: A common trading maxim applies here—cut your losses short and let your winners run. The best way to do so is to create an exit strategy before you place a trade, such as setting a stop-limit order to automatically sell if the stock drops to or beyond the limit price—say, 5% or 10% below what you paid. (Note there is no guarantee that a stop-limit order, once triggered, will result in an order execution.) Making this kind of upfront commitment can help remove your emotions from the selling process. For positions you already hold, ask yourself: Would you buy the stock at its current price if you didn’t already own it? If the answer is no, it’s probably time to sell. 2. You’ve had a string of losses Losing streaks can happen to the best of us, but sometimes a bout of bad luck can actually be a problem with our trading strategy. Attributing successes to our own skills but failures to uncontrollable outside forces is known as self-attribution bias. The fix: To begin, make sure you know whether you’re losing or making money on a net basis, then look for patterns in your wins and losses. For example, if your winning trades employ fundamental analysis and your losing trades are based on technicals, you might want to focus more on fundamentals for a while. As you work to figure out what needs fixing, there’s no harm in reducing the size of your trades. Once your results get back on track, you can increase your risk-taking. 3. The market is tanking Few scenarios trigger hasty or irrational decisions quite like a massive market decline. As panic sets in, greed, loss aversion, and wishful thinking can all collide. Instead of performing our usual due diligence, we allow price alone to dictate our trade decisions, believing it’s an opportunity for quick and easy gains. At the same time, we may double down on losing positions in the hope that the market will rebound quickly—and our trades along with it. The fix: First, don’t overlook the possibility that the downtrend could continue. Rather than getting into a trade while the market is falling, consider waiting for a few consecutive positive days before opening a new position. And be sure to do your usual homework on any stock you’re considering—bargain-basement prices alone aren’t reason enough to buy a stock. 4. The market is soaring Biases don’t just rear their heads when we’re under stress—strong bull markets, too, can trigger a host of suboptimal responses, including overconfidence, self-attribution, and herd mentality. In such cases, many traders let positions stay open too long, even when they’ve surpassed their profit targets. Some even cash out long-term positions to free up more funds to trade, potentially exposing themselves to unwanted risk. The fix: Above all, remember that gains aren’t gains until you’ve sold the position at a profit, so don’t let a trade stay open too long. Also keep an eye out for red flags that might lead to a reversal. It can be tempting to take on more risk when prices are rising, but doing so can leave you overexposed if an unexpected correction occurs. And finally, be sure you’re not risking too much of your investment capital in your trading portfolio. Many traders like to set a limit, such as not taking positions that represent more than 20% of their overall taxable portfolio. Wait and deescalate The point here is not to become a robot but rather to be on the lookout for those times when emotions can get the best of us. If you have trouble distancing your emotions from your trading decisions, it’s never a bad idea to slow down or even take a break. Cooler heads usually prevail, and trading is no exception.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Americans are moving at unprecedented rates. Here’s what to know before you follow suit.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Americans are pulling up stakes—motivated in part by the shift to remote work, which went from the exception to the rule over the past year. Indeed, 14 million to 23 million people expect to move in 2021 to take advantage of new work-from-home opportunities. Add to that the rising cost of living in many major cities and the heightened risk of climate disaster threatening others, and moving may become relatively commonplace in the coming years. Regardless of your reasons for moving, it pays to do some financial and tax planning long before you start packing. \"Moving is stressful enough without encountering hidden costs,\" says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"So, it\\'s really important to do your due diligence, or you could wind up in a precarious position that throws your finances out of whack.\" With that in mind, here are four common mistakes to avoid when making your next big move. Mistake No. 1: Underestimating housing costs \"Housing costs are going to be the core component of anyone\\'s budget,\" says John Byers, CFP®, a financial planner at Charles Schwab. \"It\\'s easy enough to plan for your monthly mortgage or rent payment, which is generally fixed, but smaller, more variable housing expenses can really add up.\" In particular, be sure to investigate: Homeowners insurance: As with any type of insurance, premiums will vary widely by company and coverage. It\\'s wise to get multiple quotes before you commit—and to ask your agent to walk you through each element to ensure you don\\'t pay for coverage you don\\'t need or overlook coverage you do. Supplemental insurance: If you\\'re moving to a coastal area prone to floods or hurricanes, or to a wildland-urban interface zone—areas at the edge of expanding human development that are at greater risk of catastrophic wildfire—your mortgage lender may require supplemental coverage in order to fund your loan. Such policies can carry hefty premiums, and some insurers have even stopped offering them in certain areas. Property taxes: Real estate websites often list a property\\'s prior years\\' tax assessments, but such taxes may be based on a lower home value than your purchase price. For a more realistic estimate, ask your broker how your new city or county determines property taxes and how often it conducts reassessments. Utilities: Electricity, internet, natural gas, sewer, trash, water—such costs can add up quickly and vary widely by location. If you\\'ll be moving somewhere with extreme temperatures, for example, consider how cooling or heating could affect your overall costs, particularly for larger homes. Taken together, the above costs can easily account for half or more of your total housing budget, so be realistic when estimating expenses. Ideally you don\\'t want to pay more than 28% of your pretax income toward total housing costs. Mistake No. 2: Underestimating taxes The tax consequences of moving can be significant—especially if you\\'re switching states. For instance, you may still be on the hook for income, payroll, and/or property taxes in your former state, particularly if you maintain a home or business ties. Employees working outside their employer\\'s state can also be subject to dual taxation, perhaps permanently. New York, for one, requires remote workers of companies based in the state to pay income tax even if the employee lives elsewhere. Work with a tax advisor to determine whether you need to withhold taxes and/or pay estimated taxes in multiple states, as well as with your employer\\'s payroll office to handle any necessary paperwork. It\\'s also important to consider a state\\'s total tax structure. \"For instance, a state with no income tax may compensate with higher estate, property, and/or sales taxes,\" Hayden says. Also look at how your potential new state taxes things like dividends, investment income, and stock options. For example: Nine states—Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming—have no income tax, though New Hampshire does tax investment income. Interest income from municipal bonds is generally exempt from state income taxes for residents; however, you could lose the exemption on those you already hold by relocating to a new state. Thirteen states even collect state income tax on certain recipients\\' Social Security benefits: Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia. You should also look into estate taxes. While the federal exemption is currently $11.7 million ($23.4 million for married couples), that number is set to come down by half starting in 2026, if not sooner. What\\'s more, some states tax estates starting at $1 million. Mistake No. 3: Underestimating the cost of living \"A lot of people assume their everyday expenses will largely stay the same when they relocate to a new area, but that\\'s not always the case,\" John says. \"Even if you\\'re not moving to a big city, the differences in cost of living across state lines can be pretty staggering.\" Depending on your needs, consider the cost of: Child care: For working parents, the cost of full-time day care can rival a mortgage payment. That said, you\\'ve got options: An in-home day care could be more affordable than a full-service preschool—and both may be less expensive than a nanny. Health care: If your employer offers health insurance, medical expenses may be less of a consideration for you—though, like everything else, costs vary widely by area and provider. Retirees will want to pay particular attention to the cost and quality of medical care, as well as options for assisted living and nursing care. Transportation: Beyond the cost of gasoline, which can vary by a dollar or more per gallon, consider the price of car insurance and registration. Some states, such as California, may also require you to pay a one-time sales tax on vehicles purchased out of state within a year of your move. And if you\\'re moving to an area without ample public transit, don\\'t forget to factor in the cost of more-regular maintenance on your vehicle. Food: It may sound incidental, but the cost of groceries, too, can vary widely. A gallon of milk, for example, cost as much as $4.69 in Hawaii and as little as $0.93 in Illinois. And if you\\'ll be living in an area with limited agriculture, expect to pay more for fresh fruits and vegetables, in particular. Also consider cost and access to nonessential expenses that can enrich your quality of life, such as entertainment and especially travel. For example, how much does it cost to fly from your new home to Europe or Mexico, or even to see your family in another state? All of these costs should play a part in your decision-making. Finally, be sure that your combined living expenses don\\'t undermine your ability to save for the future. \"For example, a good rule of thumb is to set aside at least 10% to 15% of your income for retirement,\" John says. \"Not even moving should get in the way of that goal.\" Mistake No. 4: Overestimating job prospects Many people have a job lined up before they move, but you should still do a thorough assessment of the employment market in your area of expertise. \"What happens if your company downsizes or you want to change your employer or career path?\" John asks. \"It\\'s always good to plan for change.\" Also be sure to educate yourself about your new state\\'s employment laws—including dependent benefits, discrimination prohibitions, and labor protections. \"These can have a significant impact on your employment situation, so it\\'s good to know your rights before you make a move,\" John says. More than money If your due diligence has you questioning the merits of a move, it\\'s perfectly reasonable to stay put—or to reassess your goals. \"As with so many things in life, you have to weigh the trade-offs,\" John says. \"Maybe you wait to move until your kids go to college, or you settle for a different city or neighborhood. It doesn\\'t have to be all or nothing.\" Of course, even a move that increases your taxes or overall cost of living can still be worthwhile if it offers a better quality of life.

       "   'content': 'Wharton business school professor Katy Milkman—host of Schwab’s Choiceology podcast—has devoted her career to the study of behavior change. In the following passage from her new book, How to Change: The Science of Getting from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be, Katy shows how “commitment devices” can help boost your savings. And Schwab’s own Mark Riepe offers tips for how apply this approach to your broader portfolio. “In 2002, Omar Andaya was the president of Green Bank, one of the largest retail banks in the Philippines.1 And he faced a challenge common to banking executives: his customers weren’t saving enough money. This bothered Omar immensely for two reasons. First, he recognized that under-saving has dire consequences. Second, customers with meager savings were bad for his bank’s finances. Fixing the problem would help his customers and his business. But the thing is, getting people to save more money is really, really hard. Even in the United States, which is much wealthier than the Philippines, one in three families in 2015 had no money saved whatsoever,2 and 41% of families wouldn’t have been able to cover an unexpected $2,000 expense.3 Around the time Omar took over Green Bank, about 31% of all families in the Philippines fell below the poverty line.4 So he was excited when in 2002 a friend put him in touch with three topflight academics from North America who studied consumers in developing economies.5 They had a proposal for how to increase Green Bank customers’ savings rates. There was just one small problem. A lot of people who heard their pitch thought it was crazy. The academics told Omar that he should give his customers the opportunity to put their savings in a “locked” bank account—an idea that had been refined through extensive focus grouping.6 This kind of account would be the same as other savings accounts Green Bank offered, earning the same interest rate. But it would come with an important twist: customers who chose it would be forbidden from taking money out of the account until a future date they selected or until they reached a self-selected balance. The accounts would be like financial chastity belts. Omar decided to take a calculated risk on locked accounts. He let the academics who’d pitched the new savings product offer it to a few hundred Green Bank customers as an experiment, and they’d see what happened. When the results came back, Dean Karlan, one of the study’s leaders, told me he was floored.7 Compared with the control group, those offered access to locked accounts saved 80% more over the next year. In other words, if a customer in the control group saved $100, a comparable customer with access to a locked account saved $180. That’s a really big difference! The numbers are even more impressive when you consider that only 28% of customers offered access to locked accounts actually opened one. That means a relatively small number of people in the group offered locked accounts saved so much money that they vastly boosted the savings of the whole population. The idea for Green Bank’s locked accounts didn’t come out of nowhere. History is littered with stories of people (mythical and real) who relied on similar techniques to resist temptation. Behavioral scientists call these techniques “commitment devices.” Anytime you do something that reduces your own freedoms in the service of a greater goal, you’re using a commitment device. The data are clear—commitment devices that help you put teeth behind a goal, like Green Bank’s locked savings accounts, can be something of a godsend. They help us change our behavior for the better by locking us into choices we make when we’re clearheaded about what’s good for us, not when we’re hot-headedly reacting to an imminent temptation, and they keep us from indulging in the temptation to misbehave later on.” “In 2002, Omar Andaya was the president of Green Bank, one of the largest retail banks in the Philippines.1 And he faced a challenge common to banking executives: his customers weren’t saving enough money.

So, what sorts of commitment devices can you deploy in your own finances? Mark Riepe, head of the Schwab Center for Financial Research, says any type of account that charges a penalty for nonqualified withdrawals is a good commitment device. “The consequences of breaching a commitment need to be pretty severe,” he says. “That’s why 401(k)s and IRAs are such effective savings vehicles—the 10% early-withdrawal penalty helps deter people from tapping the funds before retirement.” Health savings accounts and 529 college savings plans are two other types of special-purpose vehicles that can help lock up your savings for specific goals. Another strategy is to set up automatic, recurring contributions to your savings accounts. “When you combine automatic contributions with ‘locked’ accounts, you’re doubling down on the commitment,” Mark says. “Sure, you could turn off the contributions at any time, but it’s easier to stay committed when it just happens automatically.” Whatever methods you choose, Mark says you can further raise the stakes by sharing your intentions with family, friends, or even a financial planner. “No one wants to admit that they didn’t achieve what they set out to do, and that little added pressure could be all it takes to get the commitment to stick,” he says. 1Nava Ashraf, Dean Karlan, Wesley Yin, and Marc Shotland, “Evaluating Microsavings Programs: Green Bank of the Philippines (A),” Harvard Business School, 02/2014. 2“What Resources Do Families Have for Financial Emergencies?” Pew Trusts, 11/18/2015. 3Ibid. 4Philippine Poverty Statistics, National Statistical Coordination Board, Population Income and Employment Division and Health Education and Social Welfare Division, 01/2000 5Dean Karlan, 05/07/2020. 6Nava Ashraf, Dean Karlan, Wesley Yin, and Marc Shotland, “Evaluating Microsavings Programs: Green Bank of the Philippines (A),” Harvard Business School, 02/2014. 7Dean Karlan, 02/15/2020.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, Our mom recently passed away, and my sister and I are concerned about our dad. He's 87, fiercely independent, and lives alone. Mom handled most of their finances. We're worried about dad's ability to manage on his own and being taken advantage of by fraudsters. How can we best help him? —A Reader Dear Reader, This is a sensitive situation that's becoming more and more common as people live longer. It's not only that we worry about an elderly parent's ability to make good financial decisions, it's also that fraudsters are getting increasingly sophisticated. However, as much as we want to protect our parents, at the same time we have to respect the common desire to remain independent. It can sometimes seem like a catch-22. Many studies report that, while a person's ability to manage money declines as they age, their confidence in their ability to do so remains constant. So it's understandable you and your sister are concerned, especially since your mom handled most of your parents' finances. Another recent study found that seniors with low levels of financial literacy may be more likely to experience cognitive decline, and suggests that maintaining and improving financial literacy are important in preserving cognitive health, promoting well-being and lessening susceptibility to financial fraud. Given his need to be independent, helping your dad with his finances could be a delicate balance. While each individual's circumstances will be different, here are five ideas that can be a starting point as you and your sister work together to support and protect his financial—and overall—well-being. 1. Communicate Talking about money can be hard, but it's probably the most important first step. Decide with your sister how you'll approach the subject. Make sure you're on the same page, then set a time to talk with your dad. Tell him you're willing to help and why. Be upfront about how seniors are targets for financial exploitation. Ask questions about his personal concerns and where he might welcome some help. Does he do things online? Is he aware of scams and how to protect himself? Look for cues that might indicate he's confused or vulnerable. Encourage him to share information with you like income, accounts, taxes and insurance. Let him know that by sharing this information, he'll be helping you understand the big picture and make it easier on you if something happens down the road. The more you talk about money, the easier it will become. So once you've opened this door, keep it open. Consider setting up regular times to check in with him. Also make sure you and your sister are open with each other. This needs to be an ongoing, three-way communication. 2. Collaborate One of the keys to working smoothly together is to agree on roles and responsibilities. There may be things your dad wants to keep doing himself, and that's important to acknowledge and maintain. Once you know where he'll accept help, and where he may need the most help, you and your sister can divide and conquer based on your comfort level, skills and background. For instance, one of you could be the point person for healthcare, making contact with doctors, while the other handles finances and getting in touch with any advisors. In fact, having a relationship with your dad's advisors and health care professionals can be important in spotting any troubling signs. Also, many financial firms now offer an account holder the ability to designate a trusted contact to protect against unusual activity. This could be either or both of you. If you and your sister are clear on your roles, your father won't feel as if you're both hovering over him. Rather, he'll know to whom he can turn when he needs a specific type of support. However, smooth collaboration means you need to keep each other—and your father—informed. 3. Consolidate With a better idea of your father's financial situation, you could help him simplify things by, for instance, consolidating accounts or rolling over retirement accounts in one bank or brokerage firm. If he has several sources of income—social security, pension, IRAs—is there a way to streamline things so distributions all come into a single account? The devil is in the details, but the simpler you can make managing his money, the easier it can be for him—and you—to stay on top of it. 4. Coordinate From the everyday to the long-term, a bit of organization and coordination can help avoid misunderstandings. For instance, does your dad have a record of his accounts in a safe and accessible place? If not, help him create one. Do you and other loved ones know what to do in case of emergency? Also encourage him to use systems like auto-pay to simplify day-to-day tasks like paying bills. With your mother's recent passing, you may already be aware of any estate plans your parents had, but now would be a good time to review them. Talk about things like powers of attorney for finances and health care. Make sure your dad's will and beneficiaries are up to date and that he has an advance healthcare directive on file with his doctor and local hospital. Whether your dad has long-term care insurance or not, create a long-term care plan, including what he wants to do if he's no longer able to live on his own. All of this can be overwhelming for your dad, but if you and your sister coordinate things for him now, it will make the coming years easier on all of you. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I want to buy my first house, but with prices escalating at such a crazy pace, I’m feeling unsure. Is this an okay time to buy, and if so, can you help me figure out what I can afford? —A Reader Dear Reader, There's no question that this is a challenging time for first-time homebuyers. With demand for homes soaring and supply at record lows, prices—as you point out—are skyrocketing across the country. Another important trend is mortgage rates, which remain at historic lows. Low rates can make your new home more affordable—but at the same time they can increase market demand, driving prices up even further. As you prepare to purchase your first home, understand that there are always competing forces impacting real estate prices—all beyond your control. For starters, it’s extremely difficult to predict where prices will go. Historically, home prices have outpaced inflation, helping many people build wealth over long periods of time, but that doesn’t come with a guarantee for the future, especially over the short term. In addition, the transaction costs of buying a home can be steep, which is why many experts recommend not buying a home unless you’re confident you’ll be able to stay put for at least five to seven years. On the other side of the coin, a ‘starter’ home can be your entry into the real estate market. If you delay and prices continue to rise, it can be that much more difficult to take this first step. Bottom line, I believe that it’s best not to think of your home as you would an investment, but as your chosen place to live. There isn’t one ‘right’ time to buy—you simply have to weigh all the variables and determine the best time for you. If you've thought about all this and still feel that the time is now, let's talk about cost. Guidelines to help you get started There are several general guidelines for determining how much house you can afford—or how much you can borrow. The CFPB has some great resources for new homebuyers. Some lenders say you can afford a mortgage that's roughly two to two and a half times your annual income. Others may go up as high as five or more times your income, depending on your other assets, future earnings potential, credit score and other debts. It's good to know how much someone might be willing to lend you, but even more important is how much you can afford to pay. So the rule I go back to—and many lenders do as well—is the 28/36 rule. This rule suggests total housing costs shouldn’t exceed 28 percent of your gross monthly income. All your debt combined shouldn’t exceed 36 percent of gross monthly income. So do the math. If you make $100,000 a year, your total housing cost shouldn't be more than $28,000, or $2,333 a month. On the other hand, if you have no other debt, you might consider pushing this a bit higher, but avoid exceeding 36 percent total. (Tip: try using an online Mortgage Affordability Calculator to help you run the numbers.) What you should aim for in a down payment While how much you can handle in monthly mortgage payments is important, the other key cost consideration is the down payment. Ideally, you want to aim for at least 20 percent down. And that can be a big chunk of money. While it’s possible to put down 10 percent (or even 3.5 percent with certain mortgages), that will likely require you to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI). PMI protects the lender—not you—if you stop making payments on your loan, and it can be expensive (more than 1 percent of your loan balance depending on how much you borrow and your credit score). VA loans have no down payment or PMI requirement and also have limitations on who is eligible to apply. You also need money on hand for things like brokerage and appraisal fees, housing inspection and closing costs. If you have the down payment taken care of, great. If not, you may want to explore other options. This can include living with family, renting longer or rethinking the kind of home you’re looking to purchase or its location. Also, look at your current housing costs. If they're lower than a potential house payment, put the difference in savings each month. That way you'll not only build your down payment, you'll get used to budgeting for the mortgage. Ongoing costs to plan for Upfront costs are only part of the picture. Homeownership is an ongoing financial responsibility that includes insurance, property taxes, periodic maintenance and repair, and possibly homeowners association fees. Lenders may require proof of homeowners or flood insurance and may also require that property taxes, insurance and other fees be escrowed. Be sure to factor these costs into your monthly budget—and don't let these costs crowd out other important goals like saving for retirement. On the plus side—potential tax advantages We've been talking about costs but there can be some tax advantages that can help ease the financial burden. Currently, you can deduct the interest expense on up to $750,000 of home-secured debt used to purchase or make capital improvements on your principal residence. Mortgage points may also be deductible on an original mortgage the year you pay them. Plus, up to $10,000 of property taxes may be tax deductible. That said, don’t be seduced by salespeople touting tax deductibility. In order to itemize and deduct these expenses, they must be higher than the standard deduction. And keep in mind that nearly 90 percent of people take the standard deduction these days. Starting the process If you're ready to get going, I strongly advise you to first check your credit report. Then get pre-approved by a lender. It's also a good idea to check with a financial advisor so you can be realistic about your budget and understand how the purchase may impact other parts of your financial plan like insurance, estate planning and retirement. The more prepared you are, the better the deal you can make—hopefully for a house you'll love for years. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'Socking away a few extra dollars in a savings account each month may not be the best way to save for multiple financial goals. Consider these steps to help you achieve your goals.',\n",
       "   'content': \"A comfortable retirement. A new car. A down payment on a house. Paying for a child's college education. Coming up with a list of financial goals is generally easy. The bigger challenge is figuring out how to save for them all. The trick is to think strategically about your goals and write down a saving and investment plan for each one. A little effort today can help make a big difference down the road. Here are a few steps you can take as you work toward achieving your goals. 1. Prioritize Make a list of all the things you want to save for and how much you'll need for each purpose. We suggest keeping the list short—if you have 15 different goals, you might struggle to keep track of them. Then, prioritize your list in terms of what's most important to you and your family. One way to do this is to group savings goals by needs, wants, and wishes, in order of importance. Saving for retirement will likely be high on the list of needs. And if you haven't set up an emergency fund to cover at least three to six months of essential living expenses, make that a priority, too. Then, you can add purchases like a bigger home, college tuition, a dream vacation, a new car, or a festive wedding. 2. Categorize Once you've listed your goals, it's time to sort them. The time horizon for meeting each objective is a good place to start. This involves dividing your savings into three buckets: the money you expect to need within the next two years, three to 10 years, or 10 or more years. Knowing when you'll need the money can help you decide what sort of investments you should consider as part of your plan. In general, less volatile investments make more sense for short-term goals, as you'll have less time to potentially recover from market declines. Conversely, you can opt for more aggressive investments for long-term goals, which provides more potential for returns to grow over time. Take a look at this scenario: Bucket 1: Funds for short-term goals, say in the next two years. This could include things like a wedding or nice vacation. Consider traditionally more stable investments, such as cash, money market funds, short-term Treasury bills and notes, or certificates of deposit. By putting money you plan to spend soon into liquid, readily marketable, generally low-risk investments, you can avoid having to sell other investments, such as stock, to raise cash in a down market. Bucket 2: Money that you expect to need over the next three to 10 years. This could include goals like a down payment on a home. With a focus on growth and capital preservation, intermediate-term assets like a mix of intermediate-term bonds or bond funds and stocks may make sense for this category. Bucket 3: Savings you expect to tap no sooner than 10 years from now, say for retirement or your kids' college. This category can be invested for growth and income with a larger allocation to stocks. These categories aren't one-size-fits-all. Each should be tailored to your risk tolerance as well as your timeframe. And be sure to diversify. You don't want the fate of your goals hanging on the performance of a single asset. 3. Invest After identifying your categories, you can start putting money in them. Even modest contributions, when made regularly, can pay off substantially over time. One approach is to commit to investing a set amount toward a specific savings goal on a regular schedule—for instance, every month or every quarter. Remember, research shows that waiting for the right time to invest is rarely a successful strategy. Time in the market is more important than timing the market, so put your savings—in every bucket—to work as soon as you can. Also, stick to your priorities. Fund the items at the top of your list first, such as your retirement savings. You'll have to do some budgeting to figure out how much to save for each goal. Use one of Schwab's savings calculators if you need help. 4. Review Check on your investments at least quarterly (or more often if you have an aggressive portfolio). In general, you should consider making your allocations more conservative as you approach your goals. Shift away from riskier investments, such as stocks, in favor of more-stable ones, such as bonds. Major life events—a job change, the birth of a child, a marriage, divorce, or death of a spouse—may also call for some adjustments. Regular reviews also make adjusting your investment easier. For example, if you realize that you're not saving enough in a college fund as your child grows older, you might cut back your spending, increase your regular contributions, or (if you have more time to reach your goal) shift money into more aggressive assets that may generate higher returns. Remember that you may need to rebalance your portfolio back to your target allocation from time to time. For example, if your stocks appreciate to the point where your stock allocation accounts for a larger share of your portfolio than your target allocation allows, and your bond allocation shrinks, you could consider selling some of the stocks and buying more bonds to bring your portfolio back in line. Periodic rebalancing can help ensure your portfolio doesn't drift too far from your target mix of asset classes. Not rebalancing is akin to letting the market decide your asset allocation over time, which can significantly change your exposure to risk. Finally, stick to your plan. Down markets can be unnerving, but reaching your goals requires a long-term view and a commitment to staying the course through bad times and good.\"},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My two kids aren't even in school yet, but the cost of college already scares me. I don't want them to wind up graduating with a lot of student loans like I did, but I don't see how I'm ever going to come up with the money. How can I save enough? —A Reader Dear Reader, Looking at today's college costs can give a parent sticker shock—let alone projecting the costs when your young kids are college age. But while the numbers can be daunting, the reality is many parents today pay far less than the published prices for both public and private colleges. With the cost of college getting a lot of scrutiny these days, that may be even truer in the future. This doesn't mean you don't need to save, it just means you may need to save less than you think. Whatever future costs may be, saving early and using a tax-advantaged account like a 529 can be a smart way to prepare. But before we look into some of the details of a 529 college savings plan, let's look at some current stats you may find encouraging. There can be a big difference between sticker price and what you pay We kind of take for granted that we'll usually pay less than the sticker price for the car we drive off the lot. Surprisingly, the same holds true for published college costs. According to recent College Board research, while the average annual sticker price for tuition, fees, room and board at a four-year public college for '20-'21 is $22,180, the actual cost to students and families averages about $14,850. For a private four-year college, the costs are $50,770 vs. $29,110. The difference is due to financial aid in the form of scholarships and grants—not counting student loans. So for starters, it’s best not to take published costs at face value. Paying for college isn't all on the parents Student debt is a heavy burden for a lot of college grads as you well know, but there are other ways to cover college costs beyond loans and parents' savings and income. How America Pays for College 2020 reports that while parents generally picked up 44 percent of the bill for the 2019-20 academic year, the rest was covered by: Scholarships and grants (25 percent) Student income and savings (8 percent) Relatives (1 percent) Parent and student borrowing (21 percent) The point is you may have options you haven't considered. So before you throw up your hands in despair, consider how you might share the responsibility for your kids' education costs. Are there grandparents or other family members that might pitch in? Will you expect your kids to contribute? An honest discussion now could open some doors to future possibilities and ease your concerns. Also, put some real figures in front of you. Use a college saving calculator to explore scenarios and decide on a realistic savings amount. And the U.S. Department of Education has resources and calculators to help you determine current and future sticker and net prices. Concern about your kids being saddled with student loans is understandable. I'd advise any parent with kids approaching college age to complete the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Financial aid comes in a lot of forms, and even parents who don't think their kids will qualify, should take time to find out for certain. Currently more than 80 percent of students who apply receive some form of financial aid. To me, that's also encouraging. Starting to save early can make a big difference While there may be many ways to help pay for college, starting to save early is one of the smartest strategies. Which brings me to a 529 savings plan. A 529 is a state-sponsored program that allows parents, family members—anyone—to invest in a child's education. You open the account in your name with the child as beneficiary. Contributions are then made in the name of the child. Why consider a 529 and not some other type of savings account? Several reasons, including: Tax-deferred growth Tax-free withdrawals for qualified education expenses Possible state income tax deductibility or credit for 529 contributions Low impact on financial aid eligibility Low account-opening minimums Can be used to pay up to $10,000 tuition per year for K-12 schools, and up to $10,000 in student loan payments On the other hand, 529 plans include a 10% withdrawal penalty on earnings on top of ordinary income taxes if money is not used for qualified educational expenses. Most plans make it easy to invest by offering a number of pre-set portfolios you can select based on your child's age and your feelings about risk. A 529 is also flexible. If your child doesn't go to college, the money can be used for certain other types of post-secondary education. Plus you can change the beneficiary from one child to another (or even to yourself). That said, you may want to consider opening a separate 529 for each child. Set some realistic goals—for your kids and yourself I think of saving as a series of steppingstones to a more secure future. Best to take it a step at a time. First, set some priorities. As a parent, I understand wanting to put your kids first, but I'd make retirement a top priority. If you have a 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the company match. If you don't have a 401(k), consider opening an IRA. Then review your budget in light of all your savings goals to determine a monthly college-savings amount. If you can, put it on automatic. It may not be a lot at first, but get started now and add more when possible, maybe with gifts or family contributions. Having something like a 529 will give your education savings a focus—and allow you to check your progress on reaching your goal. I'd suggest getting your kids involved with planning and saving for their future. Teach them the basic idea of saving once they're old enough to handle money of their own. When they have an allowance or a part-time job, encourage them to contribute something to their own education. Involving them in saving for college can enrich your kids' futures in many ways. A bit of financial education now will be something they'll thank you for, whatever the future brings. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'If you’re a frequent active trader, you could face permanent restrictions if you fall afoul of pattern day trader rule.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Actively trading securities can be exciting, especially on days when the markets are volatile. But you should be aware that buying and selling the same securities within a single day—also known as day trading—can lead to your brokerage putting permanent limits on your account if you do it too many days in a row. The pattern day trader rule At issue here are rules related to margin requirements for pattern day traders. Created by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) after the tech bubble popped back in the early 2000's, the updated margin rules effectively hold pattern day traders using margin accounts to higher standards than people investing with cash accounts (or not exhibiting PDT behavior in margin accounts) by requiring them to keep larger amounts of cash and/or securities in their accounts. It works like this: If a trader makes four or more day trades, buying or selling (or selling and buying) the same security within a single day, over the course of any five business days in a margin account, and those trades account for more than 6% of their account activity over the period, the trader's account will be flagged as a pattern day trader account. If this happens, even inadvertently, the trader will have to maintain a minimum balance of $25,000 in the flagged account—on a permanent basis. If a pattern day trader account holds less than the $25,000 minimum at the close of a business day, the trader will be limited on the following day to making liquidating trades only. Not every trader wants to maintain $25,000 in their account, so it's important to pay close attention to your trades to make sure you don't end up with a flagged account. That said, Schwab does allow a one-time exception to clients who may have been flagged as day traders, so long as they commit not using the account for pattern day trading going forward. Day trading at Schwab If you want to be a day trader, then the $25,000 minimum balance requirement will apply to your account at all times. To help traders keep track of their balances, Schwab displays a feature called Day Trade Buying Power (DTBP), which represent the amount of marginable stock that you can day trade in a margin account without incurring a day trade margin call. DTBP is displayed under the Margin Buying Power in the Balances section of our platforms. On Schwab.com: On StreetSmartEdge: On StreetSmartCentral: Each day's maximum DTBP is fixed as of the prior night's market close. If you don't have an outstanding day trade margin call, DTBP will update throughout the day to reflect decreases from executed opening trades and increases from closed day trades. However, if you are pattern day trader with an outstanding day trade margin call, you must limit the total cost of all day trades for the entire day to within the DTBP figure reflected at the start of the day. As a result, your DTBP will decrease with each opening transaction during the day, but you won't be credited when transactions close. A few other things to note: Orders for leveraged ETFs reduce DTBP by an amount equal to the cost of the order multiplied by the leverage factor of that particular ETF. Non-marginable trades are subject to cash account rules, not margin account rules. Short Sales of non-marginable securities will reduce the DTBP by an amount equal to the cost of the order multiplied by four. If DTBP is exceeded, a day trade margin call will be issued for the deficiency. The call is due in five business days and can be met by making a deposit, journal or transfer of funds, journal or transfer of marginable stock, or sale of long options or non-margined securities. Funds deposited to meet a day trade margin or minimum equity call must remain in the account for a minimum of deposit day plus two business days. The bottom line Having restrictions placed on your account because of pattern day trader rules aren't ideal. If you want to be a more active trader, or occasionally do a little day trading, be sure to keep tabs on all the applicable limits. Otherwise, if you can steer clear of violating the rules, and keep your account value well over $25,000, there will be no restrictions should you need to execute a short-term trade.\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'Let’s say you’re short a single-leg put option, and the market has been chopping along, maybe grinding higher. Unless implied volatility has been steadily climbing, you’re probably sitting on an unrealized profit. Getting nervous about whether your good fortune might continue? Unless you have approval to trade uncovered (“naked”) options (more on that in a bit), your short put requirement is about the same as buying the stock outright, only with the short put, you aren’t entitled to any dividends that might be paid, and you have no voting rights. However, you still need to have enough capital in your account to cover the purchase of the stock, in case you get assigned (this is called a “cash-secured” put). And remember, a short equity option can be assigned at any time up until expiration, regardless of the in-the-money amount. Looking for a way to reduce downside risk in your current position without giving up too much of your potential profit? If you have a margin account approved for spread trading (Level 2 at Schwab), there’s a way. The strategy: Turn it into a vertical spread by buying a lower-strike put. As mentioned above, since the requirements for selling a cash-secured put is about the same as buying the stock outright, it can be quite capital intensive. The requirement equals the risk; which is the difference between the strike price (the price at which you’d be required to buy the stock if you’re assigned) and zero. But with most stocks, and particularly with the many high-priced stocks popular with investors these days, it can be a long way to zero. Perhaps it’s time to think vertically. Short option into a vertical spread? Take a leg A put vertical spread is long one put option and short another put option at a different strike price in the same underlying asset, with the same expiration date. Usually both legs of a vertical spread are established simultaneously, but you can create the same position by buying an option that’s further out of the money than the existing short option position. First, let’s look at a graphical illustration of two risk profiles—the cash-secured put and the short put vertical spread—followed by an example with numbers. Figure 1: Risk profile of a short put and a short put vertical spread Note that buying a lower-strike put turns a short single-leg put into a lower-risk spread. For illustrative purposes only. Let’s say a week ago you sold a 134-strike put option for $1.10, and now it’s trading at $0.83. The position has been working in your favor, but you’d like to reduce your risk and lower the margin requirement without closing the position. In this case, you could buy the 130-strike put for $0.25, which would create a 134/130 short put vertical spread, for a combined net credit of $0.85. That’s calculated by taking the original $1.10 premium you received a week ago, minus the $0.25 premium you just paid for the 130 put. The net risk of a short vertical spread is the difference between the two strikes minus the net premium—$4 minus $0.85, or $3.15. And remember to include the multiplier for standard U.S. equities as well as transaction costs. In summary: ((134-130) - ($1.10 - $0.25)) x 100 = $315 (plus transaction costs) in risk and a potential profit of $85 (minus transaction costs) vs. a potential profit of $110 in the original trade. Remember the kicker: Requirement reduction The initial requirement for selling a single 134-strike cash-secured put is its strike price, times the multiplier, or ($134 x 100) = $13,400. After the order is executed, the $110 credit received can be combined with $13,290 to make up the $13,400 total. If done in a margin account, the new margin requirement for the short 134/130 put vertical spread is the difference between the strikes x $100, or: (134-130) x $100 = $400. In this example, while the assignment risk of the short leg remains the same, turning the cash-secured put into a put vertical spread lowered your potential profit by $25, but reduced your requirement by roughly $12,890. Here’s an overview of requirements for these examples. Also, remember to multiply the options premium by 100, the multiplier for standard U.S. equity options contracts. So, an options premium of $1 is really $100 per contract. Here’s an overview of requirements for these examples.

Make sure you understand the terms before trading. Non-standard options may have different deliverables. Make sure you understand the terms before trading. Non-standard options may have different deliverables. Make sure you understand the terms before trading. Margin and Levels of Options Approval Without naked options approval (Level 3 at Schwab) in a margin account, you can’t sell naked puts, and instead can sell puts that are cash secured, which, as you can see from the above example, is capital intensive. By the way, selling cash-secured puts requires Schwab Level 0 options approval or higher. Bottom Line on Selling Single-Leg vs. Vertical Spreads Capital preservation and capital efficiency are two cornerstones of options trading. By vastly reducing a margin requirement through the use of a vertical spread, you can free up funds for another trading opportunity. The intensive capital requirements associated with selling naked options can even be cost-prohibitive for those with margin accounts and naked options approval, and naked option trading involves substantially more risk. Note: It’s important to remember that spread trading can only be done in a margin account, many account types do not qualify for margin, and that increased leverage significantly increases risk. So, the next time you’re short a single-leg option and are looking to reduce your risk, consider turning that short option into a lower-risk vertical spread - and you’ll even free up some trading capital in the process.

       "   'content': \"If you’ve started to research ways to generate income in retirement, you’ve likely encountered some conflicting opinions about annuities. Some see them as welcome security, while others rail against their complexity and fees. The truth is, certain types can be beneficial for turning some of your savings into guaranteed retirement income (subject to the claims-paying ability of the insurer) if you educate yourself on the benefits and know how to avoid pitfalls, if any, for the type of annuity you’re considering. Here are four questions you can ask to understand the differences between various types of annuities and decide whether they make sense for your retirement. 1. What kind of annuity is it? The first thing to know is that there are many types of annuities. Generally, annuities are contracts with an insurance company. Some can be used to save for retirement. Others can be used to help guard against the perils of outliving your assets. There are three major categories of annuities: fixed, indexed, and variable annuities. Fixed immediate annuities With these annuities, you give a lump sum in the form of a premium payment (purchase payment) to an insurance company, and in exchange you receive a monthly payment. Importantly, the premium payment is irrevocable—once you turn it over, you won’t have access again to your premium. On the flip side, the company guarantees you a monthly payment for the fixed period you’ve chosen, for the rest of your life, or for the life of you and your spouse. These annuities are relatively straightforward and have explicit costs or fees, and can work well in combination with a portfolio of investments. There are two kinds: Single premium immediate annuities can begin paying you a consistent amount each month soon after you buy them. These payments continue, typically for life, regardless of future interest rates or market performance. Deferred income annuities allow you to choose a point in the future when you want the payments to start generally, 13 months to 40 years from the initial purchase. Other than that, they operate like immediate annuities. Generally, an efficient approach is to purchase it at age 65 and start taking income around age 85 (the longer time horizon increases the income potential). That said, you should take your life expectancy into account before implementing this or any strategy. Keep in mind that regardless of which type you choose, the annuity guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. Deferred annuities Some tax-deferred retirement savings vehicles incorporate investments into your insurance contract to give you the opportunity to participate in any potential market growth. Here again, there are two types: Fixed indexed annuities (FIAs) track an index, and your potential profit is capped at a certain level. One downside of FIAs is that you can underperform conservative investments during years with poor market performance. An upside is that in good markets, you may outperform conservative investments. Also, some fixed indexed annuities won’t allow the value of your original principal to fall unless you make a withdrawal. Variable annuities allow you to invest in underlying sub-accounts. Given the market exposure, it is possible to lose money. FIAs and variable annuities are generally more complex than fixed immediate and deferred income annuities, in part because they generally offer a variety of optional features, or “riders,” for a fee, including guaranteed lifetime withdrawals benefits (also called “living benefits”) and death benefits. They may also include a more complex series of terms, guaranteed payout amounts, income floors, and other features. Unlike fixed immediate and deferred income annuities, FIAs and variable annuities that can include optional living benefits don’t require that you turn over an irrevocable lump sum. But in exchange for this flexibility, the provider may impose surrender charges—that is, early withdrawal fees—or may reduce income benefits if you withdraw more than a certain amount each year. FIAs and variable annuities allow you to convert your assets into a series of periodic payments (annuitization) for life or a specific period of time. There is no cost for this option and you give up control of your assets. Many FIAs and variable annuities offer an optional living benefit rider that allows you to withdraw money each year (after a set period of time determined by the rider) whenever you choose. Often, depending on the contract, the rider stipulates that you can take a guaranteed withdrawal amount every year for as long as you, or you and your spouse, are alive. Again, it’s critical to understand and ask as many questions as you need to understand the details and costs. As with income annuities, the guarantees of fixed indexed annuities and variable annuities, along with any optional riders purchased, are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. It’s also helpful to know that, generally, any growth of your original principal, when withdrawn, will be taxed as ordinary income and may be subject to an early withdrawal penalty if take before age 59½. 2. How much will the annuity cost? The cost of an annuity depends on which kind you’re considering. Payout annuities and fixed indexed annuities do not have explicit costs; FIAs and variable annuities do and also charge an additional cost for any optional benefits elected, including living benefit riders. The table below gives you an idea of how much those explicit costs might run you. For example, a fixed index annuity with a guaranteed lifetime rider can range from 1% to 3% of the contract value. Though the average cost of a variable annuity is 2.3%, costs can exceed 3 percent. How much will the annuity cost?

The above table is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to represent any specific product. *Fees associated with the sub-accounts available for investment within a variable annuity. **Living benefit rider costs generally are a percentage that is assessed against an “income base,” and deducted from contract value on either a quarterly or annual basis. The income base may be higher than contract value, which would increase the cost of the rider. It’s also worth noting that annuity companies generally pay commissions to the brokers who recommend them. The commissions are generally built into the annuity contract, so the consumer isn't paying it directly, but fees and expenses are generally built into the contract to cover the fee the salesperson earns. You might consider asking the annuity salesperson or your advisor how—and how much—they’re paid, for the types of annuities they recommend. 3. What are the tradeoffs? Every benefit you receive from an annuity can have a commensurate risk, tradeoff, or real or potential cost—in some cases, several. So make sure you ask questions about the risks and tradeoffs based on the benefits your annuity offers. While you gain the benefit of guaranteed monthly payments with a fixed immediate annuity, for example, you give up access to your money and potential growth. You also accept that your purchasing power will decline over time (unless you pay extra for an inflation-adjustment option). 4. How will this annuity work with my other income? When considering annuities and whether a particular type of annuity fits your needs, do so in the context of all your retirement income, savings, investments, and assets, and determine which purpose each income stream will serve. You’ll probably already have one form of income—monthly payments from either Social Security or a government pension—and that might be enough to satisfy your need for lifetime guaranteed income. But if you’re concerned about outliving your savings and want a higher level of guaranteed income that doesn’t depend on markets, one strategy might be to allocate a portion of your retirement savings to a fixed income annuity and invest the rest in a portfolio of investments. A combination of annuity payouts and portfolio can be particularly helpful if what you receive from Social Security or a pension doesn’t meet your financial needs. Another approach is to purchase a deferred income annuity that begins to pay out only later in life. This requires a smaller investment, usually 5%–10% percent of your savings, and help protect against the risk of outliving your portfolio. Here again, you’ll be able to diversify the remainder of your savings in a way that allows for liquidity, additional income, and growth potential—and feel more confident in drawing money from your portfolio sustainably early in retirement. FIAs and variable annuities that may have optional living benefits can also work with your existing sources of retirement income and portfolio, but these can be more complex and warrant additional questions and scrutiny. Make sure you understand the details before you buy. Regardless of the strategy you choose, it’s reasonable to use predictable and—if possible—guaranteed income sources to cover essential expenses in retirement such as food, housing, and utilities. Then look to your portfolio to fund more flexible or less essential expenses. If you understand the details, having a baseline of income from an annuity in combination with your investments can provide the combination of protection, flexibility, and potential for growth you need to enjoy retirement.

Not all products are available in all states. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% Federal tax penalty, in addition to applicable income taxes. A guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit is not a contract value and is not available for withdrawal like a cash value. The actual contract value will deplete with each withdrawal. Optional death benefits will generally terminate if the contract is annuitized. Variable annuities are long-term investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. The value of a variable annuity may be more or less than the premiums paid, and it is possible to lose money. Variable annuities offer tax deferral on potential growth. A living benefit is an optional rider available for an additional charge, generally assessed against the income base (the amount that guaranteed annual income is based on). It is not a contract value, cannot be accessed like a cash value, and will not preserve your account value, which will deplete with each withdrawal until it reaches zero, though payments under the terms of the rider typically will still continue for life provided withdrawals are taken within the parameters of the rider. In the absence of an enhanced death benefit, there will be no funds available for your beneficiaries if withdrawals taken prior to your death exceed the actual account value. A living benefit rider generally must be elected at the time of purchase and cannot be changed later. Upon electing the rider, you may be limited to a pre-specified selection of investment options. Withdrawals in excess of the specified annual payout amount may permanently reduce the income base.

       "   'content': \"When investors think of strategies for retirement accounts, options are not always top-of-mind. But used effectively, options can be a great way to hedge and generate income. While there are a number of option strategies that can be employed in an IRA account, in this article I’d like to focus specifically on the three strategies listed below, since they’re the most common and can be beneficial when used appropriately. Of course, these strategies can also be used in a taxable account. Three strategies to consider Three Strategies to Consider Strategy Risk Level Strategy Type Complexity Strategy Buy/Write (Covered Calls) > Risk Level Medium > Strategy Type Income > Complexity Low > Strategy Collar > Risk Level Low > Strategy Type Hedge > Complexity Medium > Strategy Cash-Secured Equity Puts > Risk Level Medium > Strategy Type Income > Complexity Low > Covered calls (long stock, short calls in equal quantity) This is one of the most common options strategies. Consider entering a covered call if you have a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment. Covered calls can be a great way to generate income and provide a partial hedge in a flat or mildly up-trending market. While the risk protection is limited to the premium received, it may be enough to offset modest price swings on the underlying equity (or ETF, since they trade in the same manner as equity options). You can sell covered calls at the same time a long equity position is purchased (buy/write), or on an existing equity position in your account (cover/write), usually after the position has already moved in your favor. While selling covered calls does create an obligation to sell the stock at the strike price which limits the upside potential of the underlying stock position, the income generated provides limited downside protection by effectively lowering the breakeven price of the equity position. When you’re establishing a covered call position, it’s generally best to sell options with a strike price greater than the price you paid for the equity. If the stock remains flat, declines in value, or even increases a small amount, out-of-the-money calls will likely expire worthless and you’ll keep the premium you received when you sold the calls. If that happens, you can sell more covered calls on the same equity position, for a subsequent expiration month. If the stock appreciates above the strike price by the expiration of the option, your stock will likely be called away. This could occur prior to or at expiration. This is not necessarily a bad thing. If you sold out-of-the-money calls at a strike price at or above your cost basis, you will generally make a profit on both the stock and the options if assigned. Let’s look at an example: Assume you buy 1,000 shares of XYZ stock at $72 and sell 10 XYZ Apr 75 calls at $2.00. The 2 points you receive for the covered calls provides 2 points of immediate downside protection. In other words, you won’t start losing money until the stock drops below $70. Of course, there is always a downside and, in this example, the trade-off is that you limit the upside profit potential beyond $75. You would only want to do this if you thought the price of XYZ would not exceed $75 by the April expiration. If XYZ did increase above $75, the stock purchase alone would have been more profitable. Viewing this strategy graphically, you can see that the breakeven price is $70 and the profit is capped at $5,000 for all prices beyond $75. Though the stock can drop 2 points before you go into the red, losses will be incurred below $70, and increase all the way down to zero. The losses will always be $2,000 less than the loss on the stock trade alone, but could be as much as $70,000 if the stock drops to zero, compared to $72,000 if you had simply bought the stock. Covered call Chart depicts strategy at expiration. It is generally best not to sell a covered call option if your stock position has already moved significantly against you. Doing so could obligate you to a selling price that ensures a loss. To avoid locking in a losing trade, before you sell a covered call, always ask yourself the question, “Would I be happy if I had to close out my stock position at the strike price on this option?” If you can answer yes to this question, you will probably be okay. Remember, if your stock rises in price and your covered call goes in-the-money, you can be assigned at any time. This is especially common on the day right before the ex-dividend date and any time during the week the option is due to expire. Collars (long stock, long puts and short calls in equal quantity) Consider establishing a collar if you are primarily concerned with protecting a position at minimal expense. A collar provides temporary protection against a downturn in the equity or ETF position, but also removes most of the upside potential. Since it’s generally unwise to hold a long stock position if you think the long-term prospects are poor, you should only consider employing this strategy if you are concerned in the short-term, but feel the long-term prospects of your stock are still favorable. Probably the biggest benefit of trading a collar is that it can often be done for little or no out-of-pocket expense; the proceeds received from the sale of the covered calls can be used to finance some or all of the purchase cost of the protective puts. In some instances, you may even be able to receive a small net credit. Unlike many other option strategies, collars generally don’t get more expensive as you go further out into the future. Since collars are best structured so that both the puts and the calls are out-of-the-money but have the same expiration date, the ideal situation is for the stock to increase just slightly (but not beyond the strike price of the call) after the collar is established. This will result in both the put and call options expiring worthless and a small gain on the stock. Let’s look at an example: Assume you purchased 1,000 shares of XYZ at $52, and now the stock has risen to $72. You may still be optimistic about the long-term prospects of the company so you would prefer not to sell your position but in the near-term, perhaps you are worried about the next earnings report. Since you have a 20-point unrealized gain in this stock, lets also assume that you would be willing to risk a 2-point downward move, but you want to be protected against anything greater. A protective put could provide the downside protection you seek, but if there were no downward move, the premium you paid would be lost. A covered call could provide limited downside protection and even generate a little income, but you could still lose all of your gains if the stock dropped substantially in price. A stop order below the current price might work, but if the stock gapped down before market open, you might not be protected, or you could have larger losses than you expected, and you might end up selling your stock. If your primary concern is just to hold steady without spending a lot of money, without selling your stock, and without the risk of substantial loss, a collar may be a good approach. Assume you establish a collar by selling 10 XYZ 75 calls at 2.00 and purchasing 10 XYZ 70 puts at 2.00. Your total out-of-pocket expense would be only the commissions charged by your broker. Viewing all three positions graphically, you can see that the breakeven price at expiration is 72 (the current stock price). If the stock drops to 70 or below, you will not lose more than $2,000; if the stock increases beyond 75, you will not gain more than an additional $3,000. If the stock drops below 70, to avoid having your put options automatically exercised, you could sell the puts at their market value before expiration. The proceeds from the puts should offset all but 2 points of the loss on the stock; but you would still incur a loss. If the stock rises above 75, to prevent the assignment on your calls, you could buy your short calls back at the market price before expiration. You would probably lose money on the call options and the loss would likely eliminate all but 3 points of the gains on the stock, but you would still have a net gain. Collar Chart depicts strategy at expiration. A nice feature of a collar is that you can define the timeframe without greatly affecting the cost. You may decide to establish a new collar each month using options that expire in 30 days or less. As long as you can do the trades at even money or a slight credit, this strategy is beneficial because it may allow the stock to gradually scale upward in price, increasing your unrealized profit. Doing this repeatedly also takes the most effort, because you have to avoid getting assigned early and you have to adjust your strike prices each month. In the previous example, one of the potential outcomes was that the stock could end up above the strike price of the calls at expiration. If you were able to buy (to close) the calls without being assigned, you would probably end up with close to a 3-point net gain on the stock. In this scenario, you might consider a new collar by selling calls with a strike of 80 and buying puts with a strike of 75. This would allow for additional upside potential in the next month. If you opted for a longer-term collar initially (perhaps using options that expire in six months), maintaining the position over that time would take less effort, but you might also miss out on further upside gains. Even if you go further out and establish the collar at a net credit, you would lock in a maximum gain of no more than about 3 points for six full months. Remember, any time you purchase a (protective) long put option, you have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise your puts and sell your stock position at the strike price. If you choose not to exercise an in-the-money option, you will generally have the ability to close out that option by selling it in the market prior to expiration. Keep in mind that, since long options lose time value as expiration approaches, your options may lose value, even if the price of the stock remains stable. Likewise, if your short (covered) call option goes in-the-money, you could be assigned at any time. And since early assignments often happen on the day before the ex-dividend date, you’ll also lose the next dividend payment. Cash-secured equity puts or CSEPs (any number of short put options) This strategy is similar to an uncovered (naked) put, except that with a cash-secured equity put (CSEP) you deposit the total amount of the potential assignment with your broker, in the event the put expires in-the-money and the stock shares are “put” to you. This ensures that you will be neither forced to purchase more shares than your deposit affords, nor lose money that you don’t have; the put is “secured” by cash. Consider establishing a CSEP if you are neutral or slightly bearish in the short-term, but bullish on the underlying stock or ETF in the long-term. Since a significant drop in the price of the underlying stock would likely result in you being forced to purchase the stock at a price above the market price at that time, you generally would not want to establish a CSEP if you felt the stock might drop significantly below the strike price on the put. Before selling a CSEP, you should always ask yourself the question, “Would I be happy if I had to buy the underlying stock at the strike price on this option?” If you can answer yes to this question, you will probably be okay. When you sell a CSEP instead of immediately buying the stock, you may be able to purchase shares of stock below the current market price. This will happen if the stock drops sufficiently in price to cause the put to expire in-the-money and be assigned. If the stock does not make a short-term downturn, you will miss out on owning the stock, but you will still make a small profit on the put option. Let’s look at an example: Assume you like the long-term prospects of XYZ and are therefore interested in buying 1,000 shares. You think $72 is a fair price, but you are concerned that it may take a small dip in the short-term. You could certainly enter a limit order at a price of $70, but instead you decide to sell 10 XYZ 70 puts at $2.00. To do so, you will need to deposit $68,000 with your broker, or have this much already available in your account. This is the difference between the potential assignment obligation of $70,000 and the $2,000 you will bring in on the sale of the puts. If the stock drops below $70 at expiration, you will be assigned 1,000 shares at $70. You should not be unhappy, since you have just bought a stock for $70, which you were originally considering at $72. Even better, your net cost basis is actually $68. Think of this like getting paid to enter a limit order. If the stock stays above $70, the puts will expire worthless and you will keep the $2,000 you brought in on the option trade, with no further obligation. Viewing the CSEP strategy graphically, you can see that the breakeven price is $68, but the profit is capped at $2,000 for all prices above $70. Notice that, even though you will have 2 points of downside price protection, losses will still be incurred and increase below 68, all the way down to zero. CSEP Chart depicts strategy at expiration. If the stock rises above $74, you will miss an opportunity to have had a larger gain, but you will still profit. If the stock drops below $68, you will begin to lose money but your losses will always be $2,000 less than if you had used a limit order and purchased the stock outright at $70. Under all circumstances, you will either make a profit or lose less money than if you had simply bought the stock. Remember, if your put option is in-the-money, you could be assigned at any time.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I\\'m currently serving active duty in the Air Force. I\\'m in the Blended Retirement System and invest 15 percent of my base pay. I also invest in ETFs in a personal account. Is this wise? Or should I just put all of my extra money in my TSP? My goal is to have some type of passive/investment income other than my pension after 20 years of service to get me by until I turn 59 ½. —A Reader Dear Reader, May is Military Appreciation Month, and your question gives me a great opportunity to provide some insights not only to you, but also to all our brave men and women in uniform. Overall, it sounds like you\\'re off to a strong start preparing for your future, so I commend you for that. I was also encouraged by a recent Schwab study that found you’re in good company; like you, 83 percent of current servicemembers feel they are making good headway toward saving for retirement. That said, while you may expect to be in the military for 20 years, your military career could end earlier due to changes in your health or personal goals. For that reason and others, flexibility is not only key to airpower, but to saving and investing for retirement— regardless of your branch of service or how long you stay in. Here are a few tips to consider. The importance of savings The reality is that fewer than 20 percent of those in the military serve the 20 years that are required to qualify for a pension, so you need to be prepared. And even if you do stay 20 years, the amount you receive each month is generally not enough to cover all your financial needs. In fact, whether you’re in the military or not, it’s extraordinarily difficult to work for only 20 years and earn and save enough to live off for the next 40 or more years. Additional savings are essential. Also remember that with few exceptions, you generally have to be 59 1/2 or older to withdraw retirement funds from the TSP (Thrift Savings Plan), 401(k)s and IRAs without having to pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty. As you point out, all of this can create a financial gap between retiring from the military and reaching 59 1/2. Bridging the gap Two common ways of filling this income gap are having a second career in the civilian sector and additional savings and investments outside of qualified retirement accounts. A civilian job can be a great way to use your valuable military skills and training. That said, the less you want to rely on work to cover this income gap and the longer you defer claiming Social Security, the more important saving and investing become. Investing inside and outside the TSP can provide you with maximum room to maneuver. TSP basic training While all service members have access to the TSP, only those under the Blended Retirement System (BRS) receive automatic or matching TSP contributions. You\\'re eligible to receive matching dollars after 2 years of service under BRS. In short, when you contribute 5 percent of your basic pay to the TSP, your branch of service contributes an amount equal to 4 percent along with an automatic 1 percent contribution. So, you get a total of 5 percent. If you stop your TSP contributions from basic pay, your matching contributions will also stop. However, the automatic 1 percent contributions will continue. After completing two years of service, you\\'re \"vested:\" in the TSP, which means when you leave, the money goes with you. On the other hand, it generally takes 20 years of service to be eligible for either the legacy pension or BRS. If you don\\'t stay that long, you keep your vested TSP balances but won\\'t receive the military pension. Whether you\\'re voluntarily contributing or automatically enrolled, investing your savings in the TSP is a fantastic way to set funds aside for retirement. It\\'s important to always contribute at least 5 percent of your basic pay because the matching contributions under BRS only apply to basic pay—not special or incentive pay or bonuses. Taking full advantage of the TSP You can contribute more than 5 percent, generally up to $20,500 in 2022, but you have to be mindful of contributing too much too early in the year. That could cut off receiving matching dollars for the remainder of the year. However, you may be able to contribute more than $20,500 to the TSP with special pay while deployed or if you\\'re 50 or older. Increasing your TSP contributions with additional pay when you can is a great way to prepare for the road ahead. If you\\'re a member of the Reserve or National Guard with access to a 401(k) through a civilian employer, you\\'ll need to consider both accounts when looking at the maximums you can defer. If you put too much into either plan, you might face tax penalties or lose out on matching funds. Saving outside of the TSP Saving outside the TSP is also super important. Here are a few things to think about: First, everyone needs an emergency fund to safeguard against the unexpected. While only 16 percent of current servicemembers consider building an emergency fund a top priority, it\\'s crucial to have enough money to cover three to six months of necessary expenses in a safe and secure account. In addition, a bank or brokerage account allows you to contribute and withdraw as much as you want. However, there\\'s no tax deduction, and investment earnings won’t be tax sheltered, so it\\'s important to use tax smart strategies. And finally, contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA can be a great way to boost retirement savings for you or a working or nonworking spouse. Also be mindful of your risk tolerance and time horizon no matter how much you save or where you invest. Life after the military It sounds like you\\'re on the right track for retirement, but don\\'t forget to plan ahead for other changes when you leave the military—from health care to housing to life insurance.

       "   'abstract': 'Although we expect higher prices over the next few years, a return to that level of inflation is unlikely.',\n",
       "   'content': 'With commodity prices soaring, money supply growth exploding, and government spending surging, there is a palpable fear of a return to 1970s-style inflation. I get it. I remember those times. Bell bottoms, long hair, aviator glasses, and disco music were popular. (Although I confess to embracing the fashions of the era, I was never a disco fan.) It wasn’t all frivolous, though. In fact, it was a tumultuous time both socially and economically. The era opened with the Kent State shootings, unfolded into Watergate and President Richard Nixon’s resignation, hit a crescendo with the fall of Saigon, and ended with the Iranian hostage crisis. In the middle, there was an economically crippling oil price spike, a deep recession, and high inflation. It’s the memory of high inflation that seems to strike a nerve with investors. What causes inflation? Inflation results when demand exceeds supply in an economy. Economists use the “output gap” to capture this phenomenon. When the economy grows faster than its ability to provide goods and services demanded by consumers, prices rise. When the economy grows more slowly than its potential growth rate, prices tend to fall. Factors that affect an economy’s growth rate include the supply of labor and the productivity of those workers. Due to the pandemic, there was a huge widening of the output gap last year, but the economy’s rapid rebound has caused the gap to narrow but not yet fully close. With more fiscal stimulus on the way, it’s likely that the gap will close later this year and potentially move above trend in 2022, signaling inflation risk. Gross domestic product growth is picking up, but the output gap isn’t closed yet Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Nominal Potential Gross Domestic Product (NGDPPOT). Quarterly data as of Q1-2021. What about money supply and budget deficits? At some point, most of us learned that inflation is, “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,” to quote economist Milton Friedman. Money supply growth is a requirement, but in and of itself, it’s not enough to cause inflation. The money needs to find its way into the economy and turnover rapidly to generate inflation. (This is referred to as the velocity of money or ratio of M2 money supply to gross domestic product, or GDP.) In recent years, the velocity of money has fallen sharply. Rising budget deficits are not necessarily linked to inflation, either, but can contribute to an overheating economy. It all depends on whether it stimulates demand to exceed supply. From a long-term perspective, there has been little correlation in recent years between the level of debt in the economy and inflation. As illustrated in the chart below, since 2000 public debt as a percentage of GDP has been high. However, inflation has held mostly below 2% during that time. In recent decades, high public debt vs. GDP has not led to surging inflation Source: Bloomberg, using quarterly data as of 12/31/2020. Federal Debt Total Public Debt as Pct of GDP Quarterly Seasonally Adjusted (FDTGATPD Index) and US Personal Consumption Expenditure Core Price Index YoY SA (PCE CYOY Index). The short, unhappy history of modern inflation During the first half of the 20th century, inflation was usually associated with wars, which caused shortages of goods and price spikes. The post-war periods were generally followed by periods of deflation as supply caught up with demand. In fact, there were more years of deflation than inflation. It wasn’t until the late 1960s and the 1970s that inflation became a long-lasting problem. While it’s often thought that spiking oil prices and excessive government spending were the leading causes of inflation during the era, there was a lot more to it than that. In the early 20th century, inflation was usually associated with wars Source: Bloomberg, using monthly data as of 1/31/2021. US CPI Urban Consumers YoY NSA (CPI YOY Index). During the first half of the 1960s, inflation averaged only 1.1% despite rising spending on social programs. However, in 1965, the U.S. increased its spending on the war in Vietnam. As with most wars, demand for industrial goods rose, pushing up prices. At the same time, there was more money in the hands of consumers, benefit of higher spending on social programs. By 1969, consumer price inflation was running at more than 5%. In response, the Federal Reserve, led by Fed Chair William McChesney Martin, raised interest rates, which sent the economy into recession. Inflation declined. Inflation is a policy choice When Nixon took office, he was eager to see the economy rebound. He replaced long-serving Fed Chair Martin with Arthur Burns in 1970. At the same time, the dollar was under pressure due to expanding trade deficits, with major trading partners (mostly France) demanding gold in place of currency. Instead, in 1971, Nixon severed the dollar’s last ties to the gold standard, effectively ending the Bretton Woods agreement and allowing the dollar to float freely. It fell by about 15% over the next few years, pushing up import prices. The expansionary spending policies of the 1960s continued, as did the ramped-up spending on the war in Vietnam. Increased government spending fueled increased demand. There were no offsetting tax hikes or spending cuts in other programs to offset the spending. Consequently, demand exceeded supply in the economy for several years and inflation moved up. It was running at 6% in 1970. To make matters worse, rising tensions in the Middle East led to an oil embargo in 1973, sending oil prices up and the economy down. Overall, inflation averaged 7.1% during the decade, although it hit double-digit levels in both 1974 and 1979. Nixon imposed wage and price controls, but that only contributed to a dismal combination of pent-up demand, weak growth, and inflation. That’s when the term “stagflation” became prominent. A key contributing factor to inflation was the way monetary policy was conducted. Tapes from the Nixon era indicate that the president pressured Fed Chair Burns to keep interest rates low despite rising inflation. Burns gave into the pressure, fearing he would be blamed for another recession and rising unemployment if he raised rates. He judged inflation as the lesser of two evils. In doing so, the Burns Fed made the choice to allow inflation to rise. That turned out to be a bad decision. He’s now remembered as the Fed chair who caved to political pressure instead of the one who avoided a recession. It wasn’t until Paul Volcker was appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 that the central bank made its move to squash inflation, despite the heavy toll it took on the economy. Different era, same choices? There are some similarities to today. Easy monetary policy and increased government spending are spurring strong demand amid shortages of goods. Pandemic relief payments and economic reopening have sent consumer spending up sharply. Most importantly, the Fed appears prepared to let demand exceed supply without reacting. Even though the output gap is still wide, it is closing quickly. As in the 1970s, the Fed is making the choice to let inflation rise today. After a lengthy review of its policies of the past few decades, it concluded that it had focused too much on inflation, and consequently had limited the economy’s growth and held down job growth and incomes for many workers. That was before the COVID-19 crisis hit. Now, faced with the deflationary impact of the pandemic, the Fed believes it has room to err on the side of being too easy for too long. No wonder investors are worried. However, there are also significant differences between the economy today and in the 1970s that suggest inflation is not likely to return to those high levels: 1. Demographics have changed. The chart below provides a useful way to envision the impact of demographic changes on the economy, by showing the ratio of young to middle-aged workers. As you can see, the ratio is considerably lower now than it was when I was sporting bell bottoms and aviator glasses. In those days, baby boomers were entering their prime working and spending years. Demand for everything from cars to housing rose, putting upward pressure on inflation. The ratio began to decline in the early 1990s as baby boomers transitioned to their saving years. It bottomed out in about 2010. Today it’s the millennials—a bigger generation than the baby boomers in numbers—who have entered their spending years. Predictably, household formation is increasing and demand for goods and services is rising. However, until recently, the expected boost to growth from the millennials has been dampened by the double whammy of the financial and COVID-19 crises. Also, while the ratio hit its low around 2010 and is rising, it isn’t likely to have anywhere near the impact on the economy that the baby boomer generation did. Consequently, while there appears to be a sustainable wave of demand taking place, it’s not as big as the tsunami that hit in the 1970s. The demographic wave appears to have crested Source: Bloomberg and Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). US Generic Govt 10 Yr (USGG10YR Index) and US CPI Urban Consumers Less Food & Energy YoY NSA » (CPI XYOY Index). The 10-year yield and inflation lines represent the 5-year averages beginning with the each 5-year cohort shown, using monthly data as of 3/31/2021. OECD historical population data and projections, annual averages, projections 2015-2025. “Young” is represented by the 25-to 34-year old cohort and “Middle Aged\" is represented by the 45- to 54-year old cohort. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 2. Labor market structure is different. A second key difference is the structure of the labor market. In the 1970s, workers had much stronger bargaining power than today. Unionization was higher and strikes were more frequent and successful. Union wages tended to keep pace with inflation and even non-union workers were routinely given cost-of-living increases. Today, unionization is low, limiting the bargaining power of labor. The majority of states are considered “right to work” states, and political pressure to boost wages has diminished. There are plenty of other structural changes that affect wage growth, such as the rise of the service sector, global competition, technological change, and educational gaps. For all these reasons, real wages have not risen much for workers in the bottom half of the income distribution, keeping a lid on aggregate demand relative to supply. It may change going forward given the current focus on income inequality, but today’s starting point is a long way from where things stood in the 1970s. Labor compensation is a relatively low share of GDP Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database, using annual data as of 2019. Share of Labor Compensation in GDP at Current National Prices for United States (LABSHPUSA156NRUG). 3. Globalization may be slowing, but it hasn’t stopped. The U.S. is still a relatively closed economy, with only about 15% of goods and services consumed coming from abroad. However, that compares to only 4% in the 1970s. Moreover, the composition of imports has changed. Despite all the talk about “re-shoring” and the imposition of tariffs, most of the imports to the U.S. are goods, with the prices set in a far more open and competitive global market than in the past. On the wage side, the opening up of Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall and China’s emergence into the global economy have combined to increase the supply of labor and dampen growth in wages in the U.S. The current mood in Washington has shifted its focus to address the issue, but if Congress can’t agree on a minimum wage hike, it seems unlikely that it will take more significant action. Even if it tried, it’s not likely to turn the clock back 50 years. Employment costs are still low Source: Bloomberg, using quarterly data as of 1Q 2021. Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Compensation Civilian Workers YoY NSA (ECICCVYY Index). The Employment Cost Index (ECI) is a quarterly economic series published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that details the growth of total employee compensation. The index is prepared and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a unit of the United States Department of Labor. Strategy: Don’t fight the Fed How should investors navigate this tricky situation? Although we don’t believe a return to 1970s-style inflation is likely, we see upside risk to inflation over the next few years. To some extent, it is already reflected in the sharp rise in the compensation investors are requiring for inflation risk. Market-based inflation expectations have reached the highest point since 2013 Source: Bloomberg. U.S. Breakeven 10 Year (USGGBE10 Index). Daily data as of 5/6/2021. There is also execution risk. What if the Fed waits too long and inflation isn’t “transitory”? In that case, it will need to tighten policy more aggressively than anticipated, which could potentially trigger a steep rise in yields and/or drop in riskier asset prices. Investors are in a difficult spot. Bond yields have moved up sharply, but real (inflation-adjusted) yields are still negative and if the Fed succeeds in raising inflation, then long-duration bonds don’t look attractive. However, with short-term rates anchored near zero for the foreseeable future, cash isn’t a good alternative. We believe investors should consider keeping the average duration of the bonds in their portfolios low to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates. If you normally target an average duration consistent with a broad index, such as the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, you might consider moderately reducing it. With the yield curve steep, bond ladders can make sense. Allocating some of the portfolio that normally would be invested in Treasuries to Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) can help protect against inflation risk—although TIPS yields are low or even negative. Income investors may need to take some sort of risk to get yield. We suggest considering a diversified portfolio of corporate and/or municipal bonds. However, with the lowest-rated bonds now “priced to perfection,” we would be cautious about valuations. Our outlook for the rest of the year is for 10-year Treasury yields to rise to the 2% to 2.5% level, but we don’t expect a repeat of the 1970s era. Although I am told that disco music is making a comeback, I’m going to guess that’s a fad that is likely “transitory.”'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, We're in our late 30s and bought our house three years ago. After spending so much time at home this past year, there are things we'd like to enhance, but we're debating putting money into a remodel at this time. Your thoughts? —A Reader Dear Reader, There's nothing like being home 24/7 to bring out the flaws in any space. No matter how much you love your house, there always seems to be something to improve. And this past year, as more people had to make their kitchen do double duty as an office or needed added space for kids stuck at home, the remodeling industry has seen a corresponding increase in business, according to the National Kitchen and Bath Association. But whether you're considering a minor upgrade, a major renovation or even an addition, it's never an easy decision. There's what you can afford, of course. Then there's the time and hassle. But there's also an emotional side. Your home isn't just a practical space to put your stuff. To some people, a home represents stability and comfort. To others, it's status or style. Many regard home improvement as an investment that will produce a return when they sell. For you, it may be all of the above. But no matter how you look at it, your home is first and foremost where you live. There's a lot to consider, both practical and personal. So before you get serious about your plans here are some things to discuss and decide. What do you need and why? Let's start with the practical. Why do you want to enhance your space? More room to work? Better efficiency? Or is it to upgrade or modernize to create a different feeling? Interestingly, according to a 2019 National Association of Realtors (NAR) report, 32 percent of homeowners say the single most important result from remodeling is functionality and livability. Only 16 percent rate beauty and aesthetics as most important. Just how much of a remodel will it take to give you the functionality you want? Adding a room is a big financial commitment. A cosmetic remodel is usually far less costly, but may not give you what you need. If you're going to spend the money and time, make sure you’re going to get the result you want. How will the remodel make you feel? Have you heard of the Joy Score? That's how the NAR has homeowners rate their satisfaction with a remodel. In the report I mentioned above, a kitchen upgrade was rated a 9.7 on a 10-point scale. Converting a basement to a living space got a 9.5, while a simple closet renovation got a Joy Score of 10. On top of the utilitarian considerations, will your remodel make you happier to be home? What will it cost? Here's where emotion has to take a back seat to facts and figures. Remodeling costs vary depending on where you live. For instance, the average cost for a kitchen remodel in the U.S. is around $23,000—but in California it's upwards of $80,000. You might want to check out an online remodeling calculator that offers estimates by zip code to get an idea of what you may be in for—which can be eye opening! A word to the wise: It's estimated that nearly half of home renovations go over budget. So even if something sounds affordable, consider adding an additional 20 percent or so for project overruns. How will you pay for it? While you may be able to cover certain things like appliances and materials from savings or put them on a credit card you can pay off quickly, what are your options for covering larger expenses? I sometimes get asked about the wisdom of tapping into a retirement account either as an early withdrawal or a 401(k) loan. To me, neither is a good choice. First and foremost, when you take money from a retirement account in any form, you're jeopardizing your future. But beyond that, there are other red flags to each. An early withdrawal subjects you to a 10 percent penalty as well as ordinary income taxes. And the withdrawal could actually bump you into a higher tax bracket. While the rationale for a 401(k) loan is that it's your money, interest rates are fairly low, and you pay the interest to yourself, there's the risk you won't be able to pay it back on time, which can also generate taxes and penalties. Since you own your home, you might consider a home equity line of credit (HELOC). HELOCs are generally low-interest, and you only pay interest on what you actually borrow. Plus, under existing tax laws, the interest may still be tax deductible if your total home-secured debt is $750,000 or less and you’re using it to improve your home. A cash-out refinance is another option if you have enough home equity. With this type of loan you borrow more than the principal balance of your existing mortgage, use the proceeds to pay off that mortgage, and put the extra money toward your remodel. However, this may be a more expensive option than a HELOC. Don't get in over your head While today's low interest rates can make borrowing against home equity attractive, be sure to calculate your debt load before you get in too deep. As a general rule, no more than 28 percent of your pretax income should go toward home debt and no more than 36 percent toward all debt. You may love your remodel now, but if you overextend, paying for it could cause financial pain later on. Even more painful is if it keeps you from saving for other important goals. Be realistic about getting your money back If you regard a remodel as an investment, be realistic about potential return. Again, the NAR offers some insights. For instance, you might be able to fully recover the cost of refinishing hardwood floors, while a bedroom renovation might return far less. Unless you're planning on selling right away, return on your money is probably the least important consideration. I can't tell you whether it makes sense for you to remodel, but I can encourage you to carefully consider both the financial and emotional issues. It may sound simplistic, but if your remodel increases your everyday enjoyment of your home as well as its functionality, you'll feel better about the cost. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': 'Many factors can affect trade executions. It\\'s the knowledgeable investor—making decisions with a full understanding of the implications of various stock order types and conditions—who can make the most of the stock market’s potential. Order types Whether you\\'re buying or selling a security, the type of order you place can have a significant effect on the execution you receive. While some market factors are beyond your control, if you place your order with a clear understanding of how it will be received in the marketplace, you\\'re more likely to get the results you want. Here we\\'ll look at common stock order types, including market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders. What is a market order and how does it work? A market order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the market\\'s best available current price. A market order typically guarantees execution but does not guarantee a specific price. Market orders are optimal when the primary concern is immediately executing the trade. A market order is generally appropriate when you think a stock is suitably priced, when you\\'re sure you want a fill on your order, or when you want immediate execution. A few caveats: A stock\\'s quote typically includes the highest bid (for sellers), lowest offer (for buyers), and the most recent trade price. The most recent trade price may not necessarily be current, however, particularly in the case of less-liquid stocks, whose last trade may have occurred minutes or hours ago, or in fast-moving markets when stock prices can change rapidly in a short period of time. When placing a market order, therefore, the current bid and offer prices are generally of greater value than the last trade price. Market orders should generally be placed only while the market is open. A market order placed when markets are closed would be executed at the next opening, at which time the stock\\'s price could be significantly different from its prior close. Between market sessions, numerous factors can impact a stock\\'s price, such as the release of earnings, company news or economic data, or unexpected events that affect an entire industry, sector or the whole market. What is a limit order and how does it work? A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stock with a restriction on the maximum price to be paid or the minimum price to be received (the \"limit\"). If the order is filled, it will only be at the specified limit price or better. However, execution is not guaranteed, because even if the stock reaches the specified limit price, it\\'s possible that orders ahead of yours may exhaust the availability of shares at that price, so your order cannot be executed. (Limit orders are generally executed on a first-come, first-served basis.) There are other reasons a limit order may not be executed even if the limit price is reached, including price corrections or executions that occurred at different market venues. If a limit order is only partially executed, the remainder of the order is entered into what\\'s called the limit order book and becomes part of the current displayed quote. What is a stop order and how does it work? A stop order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the market price once the stock has traded at or through a specified price (the \"stop\"). A stop order serves as a kind of automatic entry or exit trigger upon a certain level of price movement in a specified direction; it is often used to attempt to protect an unrealized gain or minimize a loss. However, while it provides some level of price control, like a market order, a stop order could be executed at a price much different than expected in a fast-moving market. A sell stop order entered with a stop price below the current market price. Here\\'s an example of how it might be used: You bought a stock at $150; its current price is $190. To limit losses arising from a future plunge in the stock price, you enter a stop order to sell at a stop price of $185. If the stock\\'s bid price falls to $185, or if an execution occurs at $185, or lower, at the same venue where your order resides, your stop order is triggered and a market order is entered to sell at the next available market price. Be aware of pricing gaps, which can sometimes occur between trading sessions or during trading halts. The execution price can be higher or lower than the stop\\'s trigger price. Beyond standard stop orders are two variations: stop-limit orders and trailing stop orders. A stop-limit order is a combination of a stop order and a limit order to buy or sell a stock at a specified limit price (or better) only after the stop price has been reached. Many traders place the limit at or greater than the limit price. As the stock declines in value and trades at or below the stop price, the order will trigger and become a limit order; if the order is filled, it will only be at the limit price or better. But like any limit order, execution is not assured. For a sell stop-limit order, setting a limit price lower than the stop price can increase the likelihood of its execution. And in a rapidly declining market, the larger the gap between the stop price and the limit price, the greater the likelihood of execution. A trailing stop order is an order in which the stop price will track, or \"trail,\" either the current ask or current bid by a specified percentage or dollar amount, as opposed to being entered at a specified price. Unlike stop and stop-limit orders, which are entered and held in the marketplace, a trailing stop order is held on a broker/dealer\\'s server until the trigger is reached, at which time it is sent to the marketplace. The primary benefit of this type of order is that it doesn\\'t have to be cancelled and re-entered as the price of the stock increases. Note, the trailing stop order type is available on all Schwab trading platforms except for the Schwab mobile trading platform. Overview of the similarities and differences among the various types of stop orders The table below provides an overview of the similarities and differences among the various types of stop orders.

Order instructions and qualifiers In addition to the ability to specify an order type, you can also stipulate one or more conditions—based on time, volume and price constraints—to meet specific objectives. Here\\'s a rundown of the main types of special instructions and qualifications. Time-in-force orders These specify how long an order will remain active before being executed or expired. Day-only orders are good for the current trading session only. This does not include any extended-hours sessions that occur before 9:30 a.m. or after 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET). Extended-hours orders must be specified as such. Good-until-cancelled (GTC) orders are good for 60 calendar days at Schwab. Like day-only orders, GTC orders apply only to the regular 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET trading session. Fill-or-kill (FOK) orders require that the order be immediately filled in its entirety. If this is not possible, the entire order is cancelled. This is one way to find hidden liquidity. Immediate-or-cancel (IOC) orders require that any part of an order that can be filled immediately is filled, and any remaining shares are cancelled. Order qualifiers These guidelines modify the execution conditions of an order based on volume, time and price constraints. They include: Minimum-quantity orders specify that you require a minimum number of shares to be executed in order to complete a transaction. If the minimum is not available, minimum quantity orders specify that none of the order should be executed. For example, if you enter an order to buy 5,000 shares with a minimum quantity of 1,000 shares, you are requesting that none of the order be executed unless at least 1,000 shares can be bought. While this order qualifier may help prevent a fill of 100 shares on a 5,000-share order, it may also prevent your order from being executed at all, as this type of qualifier is prohibited on orders sent to the limit order book. It would also require that at least 1,000 shares be executed at a single venue, which may not be possible, although 1,000 shares might be available if the order was broken up and sent to multiple venues. You should be careful with minimum-quantity qualifiers, as the disadvantages may outweigh the advantages. Do-not-reduce (DNR) orders specify that a broker not adjust the limit price of the order when the stock is adjusted on the ex-dividend date. For example, if you enter a GTC limit order to buy XYZ at $193 and, a week later, the stock reaches ex-dividend date for an upcoming dividend payment of $0.50, your limit order would normally be reduced to $192.50. All-or-none (AON) orders specify that the order you place must be executed in its entirety or not at all. Example: If you enter an AON order to buy 5,000 shares, you are requesting that none of the order be executed unless it is for the entire 5,000 shares. While AON order qualifiers may help prevent a partial fill, they may also prevent your order from being executed at all, because they cannot be held on the exchange limit order book. AON orders also require that the entire order be executed at a single venue, which may not be possible, although execution might be possible if the order were broken up and sent to multiple venues. As with minimum-quantity orders, be careful with all-or-nothing qualifiers—the drawbacks may outweigh the benefits. Now that you have an understanding of the various stock order types and conditions, and the factors that affect them, you can make better informed investment decisions and work toward making the most of the stock market\\'s potential.

       "   'abstract': 'If your income is too high to contribute to a Roth IRA, there’s another way in—but it comes with some caveats.',\n",
       "   'content': 'A Roth individual retirement account (IRA) would seem to be off limits for many higher-income earners, thanks to strict income caps on contributions to these accounts. But some advisors suggest another way into a Roth—if you’re willing to take the backdoor route. By this method, you open a traditional IRA, make your desired contribution and then, at a later date, convert the funds to a Roth IRA. Could it really be that easy to sidestep restrictions that have kept many investors from enjoying a Roth IRA’s tax advantages? This strategy has gained popularity with some higher-income earners, notes Rob Williams, vice president of financial planning, retirement income and wealth management at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But the IRS hasn’t weighed in definitively on what’s allowed, so it’s helpful to understand some of the issues—and it’s highly recommended that you work with a professional accountant or tax advisor, Rob says. The appeal and limitations of a Roth With a Roth IRA, you get no up-front tax deduction, as you do with a traditional IRA, 401(k) retirement plan or other tax-deferred account. However: You pay no tax on either principal or earnings when you withdraw your money (although you must be at least age 59½ and have had the Roth for five years). There’s no time requirement on when you have to withdraw money, if ever—an appealing option for those wanting to leave the money to heirs. The trouble has been, of course, that Roth IRAs technically are only available to those whose annual income is below certain levels. In 2021, those limits are: $208,000 for married couples filing jointly $140,000 for single filers On the positive side, an increasing number of employers have added Roth options to 401(k) plans. You can choose this option and contribute post-tax payroll deductions into a Roth 401(k), with no income limits. A two-step Roth conversion process In 2010, Congress passed rules to provide more flexibility and allow retirement savers to convert savings held in a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, paying taxes on the distributions when they make the conversion. Some higher-income earners use this approach, in a two-step process: Open a non-deductible traditional IRA and make after-tax contributions. For 2021, you’re allowed to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re age 50 or older). Make sure you file IRS Form 8606 every year you do this. Transfer the assets from the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. You can make this transfer and conversion at any point in the future. Some advisors suggest waiting a few months. Pay the tax due The conversion triggers income tax on the appreciation of the after-tax contributions—but once in the Roth IRA, earnings compound tax-free. Distributions from the Roth IRA in the future are tax-free as well, as long as you are 59½ and have held the Roth for at least five years (note that each conversion amount is subject to its own five-year holding period as it relates to tax-free withdrawals). If you have no other IRAs, figuring out your tax due will be simple. However, it can be more complicated if you have other IRAs. The IRS’ pro-rata rule requires you to include all of your traditional IRA assets—that means your IRAs funded with pretax (deductible) contributions as well as those funded with after-tax (nondeductible) contributions—when figuring the conversion’s taxes. Then, you pay a proportional amount of taxes on the original account’s pretax contributions and earnings. Say you contribute $6,000 to a nondeductible traditional IRA. You also have a rollover IRA worth $94,000 from a previous 401(k) made with pretax contributions. In this case, 94% of any conversion would be taxable. Here’s the math: Total value of both accounts = $100,000 Pretax contributions = $94,000 After-tax contribution: $6,000 $6,000÷$100,000 (expressed as percentage) = 6.0% $6,000 (the amount converted) x 6.0% = $360.00 tax-free $6,000 - $360 = $5,640 subject to income tax Note: If your 401(k) allows you to “roll in” an IRA account, as some do, you can essentially take your existing IRA out of the conversion calculation. The backdoor Roth may not last forever Although this strategy has existed since 2010, the IRS has not officially commented or provided formal guidance on whether it violates the step-transaction rule. (When applied, this rule treats what are several different steps as if they were a single transaction for tax purposes.) Experts have mixed opinions on the likelihood of this happening, but the lack of a definitive ruling means there is some risk involved. If the IRS decides that the loophole is a violation, you could owe a 6% excise tax for overfunding your Roth. If restrictions do come into play at some point, they could require backdoor Roth converters to pay a penalty or they might include a grandfather clause. In the meantime, it’s an option to consider. Roth conversions can make sense, generally, for many higher-income investors with large amounts saved in traditional IRA or 401(k) accounts, Rob says. “Having investments in traditional brokerage accounts, IRAs, and Roth IRAs as well as 401(k)s can increase flexibility in retirement,” Rob says. But Rob says if you use this backdoor Roth strategy solely to sidestep the earnings limits on Roth IRA contributions, you should be aware of the risks and seek the counsel and support of a tax professional.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Inflation is likely to rise in 2021—but will the rise be sustained? That seems to be the million-dollar question lately. Given concerns that inflation will rise in the years to come, some investors may be looking for ways to protect their portfolios from its effects. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are a straightforward investment that can help your portfolio keep pace with inflation, but today’s negative yields mean that total returns are likely to be low. Meanwhile, other types of investments have outperformed inflation over time, but often with a lot of volatility and more risk. Below we'll go over the recent inflation trends and provide a look into different inflationary environments to explore how various investments have performed over time. Inflation and inflation expectations are on the rise The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.6% in the 12 months ending in March, and the next few monthly readings are expected to be even higher. Given last year’s pandemic-driven drop in prices, inflation readings over the next few months are expected to be high due to the “base effect,” or the impact of having a very low rate at the beginning of the period being measured. Inflation isn’t just a concern due to the base effect, however. Sometimes inflation measured by the CPI doesn’t accurately reflect every consumer’s experience. For instance, if more of your budget is focused on shelter or health-care costs, it’s possible that the rate of inflation on your basket of goods is higher than the headline index. Inflation has risen faster on some items than on others Source: Bloomberg, using monthly data as of 3/31/2021. US CPI Urban Consumers SA (CPI INDX Index), US CPI Urban Consumers Medical Care SA (CPUMTOT Index) (CPSCTOT Index), US CPI College Tuition & Fees SA (CPIQCTFS Index), US CPI Urban Consumers Shelter SA (CPSHSHLT Index), and US CPI Urban Consumers Food SA (CPSFFOOD Index). According to economist forecasts, the CPI is expected to rise by 3.2% year-over-year in the second quarter of this year, before dropping modestly to 2.6% by year-end. Investors’ expectations for inflation are rising as well—according to the most recent poll by the University of Michigan, the one-year expected inflation rate jumped to 3.4% in April, its highest reading since 2014. Intermediate-term inflation expectations over the next five to 10 years are tamer, at 2.7%. Some investors are concerned that the recent surge in government spending—the bulk of which likely will be financed by increased borrowing, as well as tax increases—will lead to a surge in inflation. However, over the past 50 years, more government borrowing generally hasn’t led to surging inflation (although relationships can always change over time). As the chart below illustrates, a high amount of debt relative to gross domestic product (GDP) hasn’t resulted in rising inflation, either. In recent decades, high public debt vs. GDP has not led to surging inflation Source: Bloomberg, using quarterly data as of 12/31/2020. Federal Debt Total Public Debt as Pct of GDP Quarterly Seasonally Adjusted (FDTGATPD Index) and US Personal Consumption Expenditure Core Price Index YoY SA (PCE CYOY Index). TIPS tend to be attractive when inflation rises sharply Before we look at the broad array of investment types, you should consider how TIPS can help protect your portfolio against a rise in inflation. TIPS are one of the most straightforward ways to buffer the effects of inflation because their principal value is indexed to the CPI. When inflation rises, TIPS’ value and coupon payments rise, as well. However, TIPS today have negative “real,” or inflation-adjusted, yields. The yield on the 10-year TIPS is -0.8%, meaning an investor buying that security today would be locking in an inflation-adjusted loss over time. In other words, TIPS today will help you keep pace with inflation, but they won’t allow you to beat inflation, given their low-yield starting point. While that might seem like a losing proposition, it’s important to compare TIPS to nominal (non-inflation-adjusted) Treasuries by looking at the “breakeven rate.” This is the rate that inflation would need to average over the life of the TIPS for it to outperform a nominal Treasury. For example, if the 10-year breakeven rate was 2.5%, then inflation would need to average over 2.5% for a 10-year TIPS to outperform the nominal Treasury. Even though TIPS offer negative real yields today, if inflation rises enough, they can still outperform a traditional Treasury. In other words, the higher inflation rises, the greater the likelihood that TIPS outperform traditional Treasuries. Breakeven rates are at their highest level in years Source: Bloomberg, using weekly data as of 4/30/2021. US Breakeven 10 Year (USGGBE10 Index) and US Breakeven 5 Year (USGGBE05 Index). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. When considering TIPS, we believe it’s important to evaluate them relative to nominal Treasuries, as they have similar risk profiles (both are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government) and both have low yields today. With breakeven rates so high, TIPS don’t appear very attractive unless inflations rises more than the current forecasts. According to Bloomberg, economists expect the CPI to fall to 2.2% in both 2022 and 2023, while median projections from Federal Reserve officials point to inflation dropping to the 2% to 2.1% area over the next two years. TIPS can help protect portfolios against a sharp and lasting rise in inflation, but if the rate of inflation remains modest going forward, their returns are likely to be held in check. The inflation rate affects various asset classes differently Looking beyond TIPS, we decided to evaluate how the returns of various asset classes have fluctuated depending on the rate of inflation. First, we created a composite inflation indicator composed of various inflation indexes (as there are many different inflation indicators).1 Then we examined the average total returns of various asset classes depending on the level of inflation based on the composite indicator:2 Inflation below 2% Inflation between 2% and 4% Inflation above 4% Keep in mind that the total returns illustrated below are averages, and the range of total returns depending on the inflationary environment can vary significantly. 1. Inflation below 2% During low-inflation environments, stocks and riskier bond investments have tended to generate the highest average total returns, while intermediate- and long-term Treasuries have generally outperformed Treasury bills. When inflation is low, intermediate- and long-term Treasuries likely would provide higher yields than Treasury bills, as the Federal Reserve likely would keep its policy rate, the short-term federal funds rate, low. Meanwhile, easy monetary policies (which are likely during low- inflation periods) can support riskier investments like stocks or corporate bonds, because they help keep borrowing costs low and financial conditions easy. TIPS generally underperformed other investments when inflation was low, but their average total returns were similar to those of intermediate-term Treasuries. Commodities, on average, generated negative total returns, which shouldn’t come as much of a surprise because commodity prices tend to influence inflation rates, meaning low or falling commodity prices could be a factor that keeps inflation low. Average total returns when inflation was less than 2% Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data from Bloomberg and Morningstar, using monthly data through March 2021. Each index has a different start date, so not all average total returns have the same amount of data points. Please see footnote 2 for start date for each index used. Indexes included are: S&P GSCI Index (Commodities), Gold United States Dollar Spot (Gold), ICE BofA U.S. Mortgage Backed Securities Index (MBS), S&P 500 Index (S&P 500), Ibbotson US 30-day Treasury Bill Index (1-month Treasury Bills), Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Bond Index (Investment Grade Corporates), MSCI EAFE Net Total Return USD Index (International Stocks), ICE BofA U.S. Municipal Securities Index (Municipal Bonds), Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate High Yield Bond Index (High-Yield Corporates), Bloomberg Barclays U.S. TIPS Index (TIPS), Ibbotson US Intermediate-Term Government Bond Index (Intermediate-term Treasuries), and Ibbotson US Long-Term Government Bond Index (Long-term Treasuries). Total returns assume reinvestment of interest or dividends plus capital gains. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 2. Inflation between 2% and 4% With inflation between 2% and 4%, most investments have generated positive average total returns. Stocks and commodities outperformed most bond investments. Long-term Treasuries even outperformed their intermediate- and short-term counterparts in these environments. Once again, note the average total returns of TIPS—they slightly underperformed intermediate-term Treasuries. The average total return of Treasury bills in this environment was 3.8%, right in the 2%-to-4% inflation range. That’s likely the result of the Federal Reserve raising or lowering rates, depending on the rate of inflation, which helps drive Treasury bill performance. Average total returns when inflation is between 2% and 4% Source: Bloomberg, using monthly data through March 2021. Each index has a different start date, so not all average total returns have the same amount of data points. Please see footnote 2 for start date for each index used. Total returns assume reinvestment of interest or dividends plus capital gains. See source above for full list of indexes used and see disclosures for start dates for each data series. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 3. Inflation above 4% In high-inflation environments, the total return performance by asset class shifted noticeably. Commodities generated the highest average total returns in this environment, while long-term Treasuries fell to the bottom of the list. When inflation rises sharply, bond yields generally rise to keep pace. Given their high sensitivity to rising yields, long-term Treasuries suffered in these environments. Meanwhile, Treasury bills outperformed other bond investments. In high-inflation environments, the Fed historically has raised rates to “cool” economic growth. Treasury bills benefited in that scenario because their coupon rates can adjust quickly, and their very low durations means their prices don’t fall as much as intermediate- or long-term Treasury prices. TIPS were introduced in 1997, and the most recent reading above 4% for our composite inflation indicator was 1991, so there’s no TIPS data for high-inflation environments. Average total returns when inflation is greater than 4% Source: Bloomberg, using monthly data through March 2021. Each index has a different start date, so not all average total returns have the same amount of data points. Please see footnote 2 for start date for each index used. Total returns assume reinvestment of interest or dividends plus capital gains. See source above for full list of indexes used and see disclosures for start dates for each data series. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Higher returns come with more risk Simply looking at the highest average total returns doesn’t tell the whole story, as it doesn’t account for volatility or the potential for sharp declines in short periods of time. The chart below illustrates the worst 12-month total returns for each of the investments included in the charts above. The investments that have generated the highest total returns tend to come with the largest drawdowns. In other words, there are investments that can help protect against inflation, like TIPS or Treasury bills, or there are investments that can outperform inflation over the long haul, but with more risk and a lot of volatility along the way. The worst 12-month return varies considerably by investment type Source: Bloomberg, using monthly data through March 2021. Each index has a different start date, so not all average total returns have the same amount of data points. Please see footnote for start date for each index used. Total returns assume reinvestment of interest or dividends plus capital gains. See source above for full list of indexes used and see disclosures for start dates for each data series. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. What to do now No investments are perfect. Some investments can help protect your portfolio from the effects of inflation, but total returns might be relatively low. Conversely, some investments might not necessarily be correlated to inflation, but can help beat inflation over time due to higher total returns. Of course, those higher returns come with more risk and volatility. There’s a difference between beating inflation over time and being correlated with inflation. TIPS and Treasury bills tend to be highly correlated with inflation, but their total returns have been low over time. Commodities are also highly correlated with the rate of inflation, but their prices tend to be volatile regardless of the inflationary environment. Stocks tend to have high total returns regardless of the inflationary environment, but their prices are volatile. There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to which investment to choose if you are concerned about inflation. Consider the points above and your own goals, risk tolerance, and circumstances when determining which investment to hold to combat inflation. Also, a Schwab representative can help you find investments that fit your needs. 1The composite inflation indicator is an equally-weighted index using the following indexes: PCE Deflator, Core PCE Deflator, CPI, Core CPI, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 16% Trimmed-Mean CPI Index, Atlanta Fed Sticky CPI 12 Month, Atlanta Fed Core Sticky CPI 12 Month, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Median CPI YoY NSA. 2 Due to data limitations, not every investment type has readily available total return data going back to the same date. For this study, the start date for each investment type is as follows: S&P 500, International Stocks, Treasury Bills, Intermediate-Term Treasuries, and Long-Term Treasuries: January 1960; Gold: October 1970; Commodities: January 1971; Investment Grade Corporates: January 1974; MBS: September 1977; High-Yield Corporates: July 1984; Municipal Bonds: September 1990; TIPS: March 1998.\"}],\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, Unlike so many other women, I was fortunate to hang onto my job during the pandemic. However, after a year-plus of caring for my two kids, helping them with schoolwork, keeping the house running, PLUS holding down a full-time job, I'm exhausted and considering giving up my job. My husband makes a good income, but we will definitely have to get by with less. How can I decide, and if I go ahead with this plan, how can we best prepare? —A Reader Dear Reader, First, let me say that you're not alone in feeling the brutal impact of the last year. According to the McKinsey Women in the Workplace 2020 report, the pandemic only intensified the multitude of challenges that working women have always faced. More women than men were furloughed or laid off, and many mothers—like yourself—were crushed by the challenges of keeping up both at home and at work, and now feel the need to take a break. Therefore, my first impulse is to say you need to do whatever is necessary to take care of yourself—not only for your own well-being, but also for the well-being of your family. That said, leaving a job can have far-reaching consequences on many levels—financial, emotional, and professional. There's a lot to think about. Of course, every family's situation will be different. While I'm happy to help you put things in perspective, as with any big change, it's important for you to sit down as a couple to talk it through. Let's start with the financial portion. First, be realistic about the short term Short-term, it's kind of a balancing act. On the minus side, leaving your job means you have less money coming in. On the plus side, it can also mean you'll have less money going out. For instance, you may be able to subtract costs like commuting, work clothes, dry cleaning, housekeeping, and lunches out from your budget. You may not have had these costs last year, but they may come back with a 'return to normal.' Then there's childcare, which is probably the biggest work-related expense for most parents, as I'm sure you're well aware. Childcare costs vary by region, but just as an example, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), in 2020, a parent in Mississippi paid an average of $5,436 a year for infant childcare. In Massachusetts it went up to $20,913 per year, and in Washington, DC, $24,243. And that's only for one child! No longer paying childcare for two kids could mean significant savings. New child and dependent care tax credits under the American Rescue Plan Act may also help reduce your outflows. However, a stay at home parent doesn't qualify for the dependent care credit. Will the savings make up for the loss? That's what you really need to decide as you reprioritize and refine your budget to balance income and expenses. And beyond everyday budgeting, you also want to look carefully at employee benefits you may be losing. For example, make sure you'll still have adequate health insurance for you and your family, as well as enough life insurance. Don't ignore the long-term impact The long-term implications can be even more important, especially when it comes to career development and growth in earnings. If you leave your job, but decide to return to it in several years, will you also sacrifice your chances for advancement or face a lower salary because of your time away? You may understandably feel that you need time at home for now and be happy to put your career on the back burner, but kids grow up fast. I know! Whether you eventually return to your current profession or try something new, chances are you'll find your way back to the workforce as the kids get older. How will you keep your job skills up-to-date? At the very least, stay in touch with your colleagues and keep up on new developments in your field. Also think about the potential long-term hit to your retirement savings. If you were contributing to a 401(k), how will you make up for this shortfall in savings? You could open a Spousal IRA. Currently, in 2021/2022, a non-working spouse can contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 age 50 and over) annually to an IRA as long as the working spouse has enough earned income to cover all retirement contributions, but that may not be enough for a secure retirement. Then there's saving for your kids' education. That can be hard enough on two salaries, let alone one. Could you direct some of your childcare savings to a 529 account? I'm not saying that deciding to leave the workforce is a mistake, because the circumstances are different for every family. I just think it's important to realize that the financial impact goes beyond choosing not to take a vacation or buy a new car in the next few years. It can have a significant effect on your future financial security. Be equally aware of the emotional side Finances aside, how your everyday life will change is equally important. Since you've been working you might have gotten used to being independent, having your own money and professional identity. Looking to the future, will you feel too dependent when you no longer have your own salary? Money is a known cause of problems for many couples, so make sure you discuss this openly before you make the change. For instance, will you budget a certain amount each month for your personal expenses? What is a fair way to divide up your discretionary income so neither of you becomes resentful of the other? Don't just assume everything will work out. The shift can be jarring, and it often takes time to adjust to new roles and responsibilities. Come to some agreements before your leave your job. Remember, it can work both ways Given the ravages of last year, your dilemma is completely understandable. It's not an easy decision, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Only you can balance the financial loss with the personal gain. One other thought: if you do decide to make this change, realize that what you work out today for yourself could just as likely apply to your spouse down the road. And I think that's great. As long as you're supportive of each other—and realistic about the personal as well as the financial implications—you and your family may all benefit from this new arrangement.

       "   'content': 'The market for newly public companies is constantly in flux. Sometimes investors are eager to dive into the next listing, and other times, they may shy away from new potential opportunities if they see too much risk. Whether the market for new listings is hot or cold, investors interested in public offerings should learn exactly how companies can list and what each listing strategy entails. Initial public offerings (IPOs) use a broker, while direct public offerings (DPOs) offer a more direct approach. Both, however, are ways in which companies can sell shares for any reason. Although DPOs are not as common as IPOs, each way of issuing shares comes with potential advantages and disadvantages for both the average investor and the company itself. Then there are special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), aka “blank-check companies.” SPACs have been around for a long time, but they’ve become more popular in recent days after several high-profile SPAC success stories. Technically, though, a SPAC isn’t an alternative to an IPO or DPO. In general, investors access SPACs upon (or after) a public offering such as an IPO. With that in mind, here are some of the differences between IPOs and DPOs (with a few “SPAC facts” sprinkled in). Initial public offerings carry underwriter expertise The traditional way for companies to go public is through an IPO backed by at least one investment bank. Institutional and other large investors typically have first access to the shares before market open—the general public is essentially a step behind them. So the average investor may miss out on any early gains from an IPO, whereas inside institutional investors can take full advantage. With an IPO, an opening price is set beforehand, and the main goal is usually to raise outside capital. The underwriting process by an investment bank is usually longer than with a DPO, but the bank’s backing also provides the firm with an idea of how much capital will be raised before investors make a commitment for the offering. Many of the largest public companies trading today opened to public trading through an IPO, including Alibaba (BABA), Visa (V), and Facebook (FB)—which were among the largest IPOs of all time. Direct public offerings level the investing field Direct public offerings, also known as direct listings, are not as common as IPOs, but some companies prefer this strategy when issuing shares. That’s partly because they can avoid underwriting costs. Some experts believe a direct listing can offer greater liquidity and better price discovery. With DPOs, companies may have more control over the terms of their offerings because they aren’t working with an investment bank to issue shares. As a result, all investors have equal access to the shares (instead of some investors getting early access, as with IPOs). The price of shares at the open is determined purely by the market, not a preset price. Instead of aiming to raise new outside capital, a DPO allows current owners to convert their stakes into stock they can sell. And because companies avoid the underwriting process, a direct listing is usually faster and less expensive. Of course, the flip side is that these offerings don’t provide the backing of a financial institution, and sometimes have more volatile outcomes once the stock starts trading. Several well-known companies, such as tech firms Slack Technologies (WORK) and Spotify Technology (SPOT) opted to skip the IPO process for the DPO approach when they opened to public trading. Eyeing a SPAC? They have their own unique risks A SPAC is a company in the developing stage—with no real business plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition within a specific time frame. It’s essentially a pool of funds created to buy another company (similar in fashion to many private equity funds). SPACs are designed to be flexible, if not a bit secretive. Although some SPACs disclose the specific industry where they seek to make an acquisition, SPACs do not pre-identify possible acquisition targets. For this reason, underwriters do not undertake any due diligence on acquisition targets. But the risks don’t stop there. Per Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, a SPAC must typically complete an acquisition within 18 to 24 months and must use at least 80% of its net assets for any such acquisition. If it fails to do so, it must dissolve and return to its investors their “pro-rata” share of assets in escrow. So what’s the allure? Sure, SPACs are highly speculative, but the lower regulatory bar can dramatically shorten the time it takes to get funding. In a disruptive, fast-growing industry such as electric vehicles and related technologies, a SPAC can help more speculative-focused investors get in at or near the ground floor. Just do your homework before jumping in. Risks and opportunities of investing in newly public companies Whether you invest in a newly listed company through an IPO or a DPO, there are several potential risks and benefits to consider. On the plus side, IPOs and DPOs that succeed can offer investors a rapid rate of return as the market determines the company’s value. For example, shares of Zoom Video (ZM) doubled on its April 2019 IPO and then hopped along awhile, but shares took off to the upside in the 2020 coronavirus-related “stay-at-home” economy. However, newly public companies sometimes see shares tank on their debut. In the case of social media giant Facebook (FB), shares crashed in the months following its hyped 2012 IPO. It took a while, but eventually they came back and now trade several orders of magnitude above the IPO level. When you consider investing in an IPO or DPO, remember to look beyond a company’s brand and consider its business operations. Just because you like a company’s product doesn’t necessarily mean the stock is a good investment. Make sure you know the key financial metrics: the company’s debt, profit, and revenue trends. Public offerings in a nutshell Newly public companies tend to perform better when the overall market is doing well and less impressively when the broader market slumps. New publicly traded companies can at times carry more risk than more established publicly traded companies, so it’s important to assess your risk tolerance prior to making any investments. Still, IPOs and DPOs—and even SPACs—have the potential to offer significant returns, which makes them an interesting idea to consider for many investors. Even though companies with new offerings won’t have a lengthy history of public information available to investors, you should still be able to learn about key financial metrics by reviewing the detailed prospectus that becomes available prior to the IPO or DPO.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, With five credit cards, student loans, a car loan, and a few other debts, I feel overwhelmed. I’m current with everything and have okay credit, but just keeping track of all the payments is a hassle and constantly stresses me out. Most of my debts are already on auto-payment, but I’d like to consolidate my debt to make things more manageable. Is this a good idea? —A Reader Dear Reader, Borrowing money is pretty easy. Paying it back is the hard part. And yes, handling multiple payment amounts and repayment schedules is stressful. It's one of the hidden “costs” of borrowing that affects millions of Americans. Debt consolidation could help you manage by streamlining payments and simplifying accounting. That may reduce your stress—but it won't reduce your debt. You're still on the hook for the money you borrowed. That's not to say consolidating isn't a good idea. But before you do, there are few things to consider. Try these pre-consolidation moves Managing current debt is one thing, making sure you don't take on more debt is equally important. So first, take a step back and look at how your expenses compare to your income. Are you overspending? If so, try to reprioritize and make changes in your budget before consolidating. If it's just a question of monthly management, there are a few things you could do on your own. For instance, try reaching out to your creditors. You may be able to negotiate lower interest rates or change payment due dates which would help you feel more in control. Talking to a credit counselor could help you put your debt in perspective and come up with managing techniques. If you choose to consolidate, look beyond the monthly payment Consolidating is taking out a single loan to pay off multiple loans. On the plus side, this means a single payment at possibly a lower interest rate with a corresponding lower monthly obligation. This may give you more breathing room short-term—but it could also extend your pay-off date, increasing the interest you pay over the life of the loan. So look at the big picture. The terms of a consolidation loan are important and depend on several factors, including your credit score, whether the debt is secured, how much you're borrowing, and current interest rates. Then there are things like balance transfer fees, closing costs and total interest paid. These can actually add to your debt. Simplifying your finances and freeing up some monthly cash may be a worthwhile trade-off. On the other hand, the total cost over time might not be worth it. Be sure to shop around for the best possible deal. Carefully weigh your consolidation options There are a few different ways to roll all your debts into one. But like anything else, there are pros and cons to each and the choice for you depends on your timeframe and the risk you're willing to take. Balance transfer credit card—The simplest approach for credit card debt is transferring multiple balances to a single, low-interest card. The upside is you have one payment; the downside is that there are often balance transfer fees and possibly an annual fee. Unsecured personal loan—Offered by banks, credit unions and online lenders, there's no collateral required for this type of loan. Your creditworthiness is key to getting the best terms. Interest rates are usually fixed and repayment terms may be flexible. But look out for origination fees and prepayment penalties. 401(k) loan—Since there are no credit checks, and interest rates are generally low, a 401(k) loan can make sense in certain circumstances. But it's not a no-risk, no-cost option. First, you're borrowing against your retirement. Plus you risk incurring taxes and penalties if you don’t make timely payments. Finally, if you leave your job, you may have to pay back the loan in full in a very short time. Home equity line of credit (HELOC)—Low interest rates can make this an attractive option for homeowners. However, interest on HELOCs used to pay off debt is no longer tax deductible. Plus, refinancing unsecured debt like credit card balances with a secured home equity loan has inherent risks. If you’re late on making required payments, you could lose your home. Watch out for debt settlement scams People with debt make prime targets for scammers—so beware of debt relief and credit repair offers, especially those offering debt forgiveness or settlement. These programs are different from loan consolidation and are often scams. A big tip off is if you're asked for money upfront. Typically, a debt settlement company recommends you stop debt payments and instead pay money upfront into a special account, which will be used to attempt to negotiate with your creditors. The catch is that while you may think reaching an agreement with a debt settlement company lets you off the hook if you miss a payment, interest, fees and penalties can still be added to the principal. Plus, you run the risk that creditors will hire debt collection agencies. On top of that, missed payments will show up as a negative transaction on your credit report, making it harder to get credit in the future. Even if a creditor agrees to accept less than the full amount owed, it will still impact your credit score. Take special care with student loans Consolidating student loans raises a whole different set of issues. And having multiple student loans, both federal and private, makes consolidation more complex. Take special care here. For instance, federal direct consolidation loans are only available for federal student loans. They won’t necessarily lower your interest but can make payments easier with fixed rates and longer payback periods. On the other hand, private consolidation loans may offer lower interest rates (fixed or adjustable), but don't have the same protections as federal loans, such as income-based repayments, forbearance and forgiveness. The loan may also include additional fees and costs. And once you refinance federal loans into a private loan, you can’t turn them back into a federal student loan to get the federal program benefits. Manage for both the short and long term As you focus on managing your debt, also look at your bigger financial picture—your budget, goals and plans to reach them. Loan consolidation could help you get a better handle on your debt now, but make sure you're also thinking about the long term—which hopefully includes controlling debt in the future.

       "   'content': 'When I teach options seminars, I often ask how many participants are brand-new to options. Almost always, about half to three-quarters have never traded an option before. This tells me that investors are interested in options, but perhaps, they don’t know where to start. This article provides a step-by-step guide to help you: Set up your first options trade—a covered call Possibly sell a very small stock position at a favorable price An option is a contract giving the owner the right, but not the obligation (hence “option”), to buy or sell a stock, exchange-traded fund (ETF) or other security at a set price (called the strike price) within a specified period of time. When trading options for the first time, investors sometimes select long call options. This gives you the right to buy a specified stock (or other security) at any time until the contact expires. However, the results are often disappointing because both time and price can work against you. Instead, I recommend considering a covered call for your first options trade. Why a covered call? A covered call is when you sell someone else the right to purchase a stock that you already own (hence “covered”), at a specified price (strike price), by a certain date (expiration date). When it’s structured properly, both time and price can work in your favor. Additionally, a covered call is generally considered a relatively low-risk strategy, and approval to trade covered calls can usually be granted to investors that have never traded options before. How do you get started? After your Schwab account is approved for options trading, follow the steps below. Step 1: Identify the position Select a stock position in your account with the following criteria: You hold at least 100 shares The stock trades at a higher price now than the original purchase price The stock does not pay dividends (or pays very small dividends, or you’re not counting on receiving dividends) You would be willing to sell the stock at the strike price at any time through the expiration date. You can sell one covered call for every 100 shares of the stock you own. In our example below, we’ll be assuming that you sold only one covered call. Step 2: Determine price Once you\\'ve selected your position, you’ll need to determine a price at which you would be willing to sell just 100 shares of your stock anytime within the next 30 to 60 days. In making this decision, analyze a one-year price chart. For example, assume it’s March 8, 2021 and you\\'ve chosen stock XYZ. You only want to sell 100 shares if the stock\\'s price gets back near its peak. As you can see in the price chart below: The current price of XYZ is $79.01. The stock has traded within about a 20-point price range over the past 12 months. The highest price that XYZ has reached over this time was around $84.00 several times last year. Source: StreetSmart Edge®. Step 3: Set up a covered call You may be able to sell one covered call option on XYZ with a strike price near $84.00 and an expiration date 30 to 60 days from now. To determine if this is feasible, you\\'ll need to find available strike prices using an order entry tool on one of our trading platforms, such as StreetSmart Central, or in this example, StreetSmart Edge®. You can also use Schwab.com. 1. Open StreetSmart Edge. 2. Click Launch Tools. 3. Select All in One Trade Tool. Source: StreetSmart Edge. 4. Navigate to the upper left-hand corner of the window and enter the underlying stock symbol in the symbol box. 5. Click the Options tab. 6. From the strategy box, select Calls. Source: StreetSmart Edge. Focusing on just the monthly options, the only expiration date that falls within your 30 to 60 day window is April 18, 2021, (which is 42 days away). On that date, there is a call option available with a strike price of $82.50, which is fairly close to the $84.00 peak price. Source: StreetSmart Edge. 7. Click on the $82.50 contract and select your limit price ($0.56 in example below). 8. Ensure you’ve selected the appropriate quantity (1 in example below). 9. Enter your preferred timing. In this example, we\\'ll use “GTC” (Good until cancelled). Source: StreetSmart Edge. If you want to change your limit price, you can use the up and down arrows, but for your first trade, consider just entering a limit price that is equal to the bid. Unless the market price moves away from you immediately, this will likely result in an immediate execution, and eliminate the need to wait for the stock price to change in order to get executed. The trading platform automatically calculates your maximum gain, break even and maximum loss for this sale of one call option. However, because the system does not realize this is a covered call until it executes, these calculations do not include the sale of 100 shares of XYZ if you get assigned. A few things to keep in mind: Maximum gain occurs if you get assigned and your stock is called away. Maximum loss occurs if XYZ drops to zero, which is very unlikely. Your actual max loss would be -$7,845 (-$7,901 on the stock +$56 on the option). The actual breakeven price of 78.45 is below the current market price, so this trade actually provides a small amount of downside protection, which comes from the $0.56 option premium. 10. Select the Sell to Open button. Source: StreetSmart Edge. 11. Verify the trade and place the order. Source: StreetSmart Edge. When this order is executed you will have a short call position and receive a credit of $56 (before commissions are deducted). This call will automatically be \"paired\" as a covered call against 100 shares of your XYZ position. (Typical commission charges for this trade would be $0.65 per contract.) What to watch out for Although the premium received from the sale of a covered call provides some downside risk protection, it does not eliminate risk entirely. If the price of the underlying stock drops substantially prior to the expiration date, your losses could be significant. If your short call goes “in the money,” you could be assigned at any time. Anytime you sell a covered call, you have established a maximum selling price for your stock. Any movement in the stock beyond that established price creates no additional profit. It is rarely a good idea to sell a covered call if your stock position has already moved significantly against you. This could cause you to establish a closing price that ensures a loss. While the example above assumes that you hold the position(s) until expiration, you can usually close out a covered call by buying it back at the current market price. Watch out for the ex-dividend date. This is the first day following a dividend declaration when a stock buyer is not entitled to the next dividend payment. While stock prices are adjusted for normal quarterly dividends, option prices are not. As a result, when you sell a covered call on a stock that pays dividends, you are at risk of being assigned early if the call goes in the money. The bottom line While options trading can be complex, it doesn\\'t have to be intimidating. For many traders, options can provide an effective way to generate modest amounts of income or try to hedge against market and portfolio risk.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Want to boost your teen's financial education? Give them some hands-on money experience.\",\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Parents of Teens, The pandemic has changed our everyday reality in so many ways—financially, educationally and socially. Money may be tighter, your kids may be doing online school, and we're all spending a lot more time at home. But for all the changes in our everyday lives, according to a recent Schwab survey, there's one thing that hasn't changed for a lot of people: the importance we place on financial education. In fact, in the face of new economic pressures, parents who took the survey rated money management as the most important skill for their kids to learn—outranking health and wellness education as a supplementary graduation requirement to math, English and science. The question, of course, is where do kids get this crucial education? Schools are getting better at it. Twenty-one states now require high school students to take a personal finance course. That's a start, but there’s a lot more work to be done. Here's where you as a parent can help fill in the gaps. Five practical ways to get started With your kids home more these days, you may have more opportunities to start a conversation about money. And if your family economics have changed due to the pandemic, there's even more to talk about. But real learning comes from doing. So instead of just talking about money, give your kids some hands-on money experiences and responsibilities. For instance: Use daily opportunities as “teachable moments.” When you’re paying bills, let your teen see what it costs to run a household, how bills get paid and a checkbook balanced. If you pay your bills online, show them how it's done—and how online bill-pay is linked to your checking account. Pay an allowance only once a month. To learn how to budget and save, kids have to have their own money. Once your child is a teen, consider giving them their allowance monthly instead of weekly; that way they can also learn how to make their money last. Help them understand the difference between needs and wants and how to budget for both. (If you've had to make trade-offs in the past year, let them know why and how you did it.) Make them responsible for a certain share of their own expenses (for example, clothing, new electronics or extra-curricular activities). Most of all, let them learn from their mistakes. Don't immediately come to the rescue if they come up short. Open a checking account. Show your teen how to use a check register and review monthly statements online or on paper. Guide them in using a debit card wisely and keeping track of debit expenditures. Show them how to use an ATM machine for deposits and withdrawals, and talk to them about potential fees associated with different accounts. Help make savings a habit. Help your teen open a savings account. Talk about goals and setting savings priorities. Suggest saving a percentage of any earnings or gifts toward a goal. If your teen has a job, have them set up direct deposit from their checking account to their savings account. Consider matching a portion of their savings to further motivate them to put money away for the future. Get them started investing. Saving gives you money to work with, but investing puts your money to work. Teaching your teen about compound interest can be eye-opening. Using fractional shares to invest in stocks can be a fun way of getting them involved and engaged in conversations about how the stock market works. If your teen earns a paycheck, you can help them set up an IRA for the future. Evidence it works Does financial education work? Recent studies confirm the positive effects of financial education on behavior and decision-making and that the effects are long-lasting. While more research and support is needed, I've seen the results myself through my experience with the Money Matters: Make It Count program offered through Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA). Kids who participate show dramatic improvement in their understanding of personal finance concepts. Now in its 17th year, with over a million teens having participated in the program, Money Matters has shown some remarkable results. Part of the success derives from BGCA’s efforts to make the program relevant to teens through a wide range of experiential activities and content. A great example is the Money Matters Reality Store, a real-world interactive workshop, where kids discover firsthand how education, career, family and spending can impact their financial futures. There's nothing like experiential activities to give kids a taste of financial reality. In fact, giving your kids some extra screen time for financial videogames that simulate real-life economic experiences can be an excellent motivator! More than just money Financial education is about our sense of well-being, creating equal opportunities, even strengthening our relationships. So the more we can share with our kids about our own money management practices—from household budgeting to saving to investing—the richer their lives will be on many levels. Be open and talk freely about how you handle your money; teach them by your good example. And be sure to give them feedback as they make their own financial decisions. If you need to sharpen your own knowledge in any particular areas of personal finance, visit SchwabMoneywise.com, which offers tools and resources for anyone who wants a refresher in the basics, as well as those just starting out. But don't let schools off the hook. If a financial literacy class isn't offered at your teen's school, get involved. Petition your school district to have one added to the curriculum. To me, money management is a critical life skill that everyone needs. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': '\"Flying is less scary if you know that you know how to handle an emergency,\" my flight instructor once wisely advised me. Turns out, what he considered flying wisdom would also prove to be investing wisdom. Let’s talk specifically about dividend-oriented investing. First, when investing in dividends, be wary of selecting a dividend yield that\\'s too high. A good rule of thumb when making your selection is to use the approximate yield of the 10-year treasury, and then seek no more than twice that yield in dividends. For example, with the 10-year treasury yield about 1.7% as of mid-March 2021, any dividend yield much above 3.5% may be \"too high.\" I know that level may seem too low and it does not mean to totally avoid higher yielding stocks. I would suggest doing additional research and having a clear reason for owning higher yielding stocks since there may be an additional risk. It is easy to be drawn to higher yielding stocks. However, it\\'s important to be wary of stocks that appear to be cheap: their low prices could be due to the company\\'s outdated products, bad management, expired patents, pending lawsuits, etc. This is where extra research may save the day (and your capital). Second, don\\'t let fear of the unknown lead to bad dividend investing decisions. Dividend stocks are generally long-term investments, so in times of uncertainty, selling your stock may not be the answer. How do you know when it\\'s time to sell your dividend-paying stock? I suggest devoting an hour a month monitoring your stock\\'s performance using both technical and fundamental analysis to determine if the risk of a potential dividend cut is rising. If a dividend cut looks to be more probable, then it might be time to sell the stock. Here are three steps to monitor your dividend-paying stocks: Step 1 (technical analysis): Review a 5-year weekly price chart. When reviewing a price chart, look for a change in trend from up, or sideways to down. It is widely recognized that stock prices \"lead\" fundamentals lower. Therefore, a change in trend from up or sideways to down can act as a warning of potential trouble ahead. Let\\'s use General Electric as an example. As you can see in the chart below (Figure 1), General Electric dropped beneath the most recent lows in early 2017 at approximately $28.00/per share. Six months later, General Electric cut their dividend in half, at approximately $18 per share (35% lower than the alert price of $28). Ten months later, after General Electric had cut the dividend to 1 cent per share, it was trading at about $10 per share (64% lower than the alert price of $28). As of mid-March 2021, the dividend has not been increased and GE is trading just above $13 - more than 50% below where a change in trend lower gave an initial warning. 5-Year Weekly Price Chart for GE Figure 1.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Step 2: Set a price alert on Schwab.com. Long-term holding, such as dividend paying stocks, should not be sold merely because the price breaks a certain level. Instead, you can set a price alert (Figure 2) to notify you if a certain price level is breached. Figure 2. Source: Schwab.com. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Step 3 (fundamental analysis): If the price alert is triggered, treat it just like an alarm and respond swiftly. The triggering of the price alert should prompt you to perform a company review using these three key fundamentals: Earnings: has earnings growth slowed? Revenue: has sales growth slowed? Dividend: is the dividend payout ratio rising above 100%? Note: The dividend payout ratio is measured by the percentage of a company\\'s earnings per share (EPS), which is paid to shareholders in dividends. Ideally, that ratio should be under 50% for most companies - and you most certainly don\\'t want to see it rising above 100%. (There are exceptions, such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT\\'s) and Master Limited Partnerships (MLP\\'s), which have different accounting rules than regular corporations.) To see if earnings has slowed, I suggest looking at \"GAAP\" (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) only, because this applies a consistent set of accounting rules across all companies. Using this measure compares \"apples to apples.\" While the company in the chart below (Figure 3) is not General Electric from early 2017, it provides an example of what you do not want to see when reviewing earnings and sales growth. Figure 3. Source: Schwab.com. Examples provided are for illustrative purposes only and not intended to be reflective of results you can expect to achieve. Screenshots are historical in nature. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Now looking at dividends: the chart below is from March 2021 and the dividend payout ratio is a reasonable 19% (Figure 4). However, in this same chart from September 2019 (not shown), General Electric had no payout ratio due to negative earnings. In this case, you might want to consider selling the stock rather than waiting for the price to rally. Figure 4. Source: Schwab.com. Examples provided are for illustrative purposes only and not intended to be reflective of results you can expect to achieve. Screenshots are historical in nature. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. To put it another way, the co-authors did a review of 1,000 stocks compromising the Russell 1000 Index (RUI) from January 2010 to December 2020, in a market where dividend cuts were generally rare until COVID hit the economy in 2020. This data provides statistical validity that stock price generally trends down significantly prior to a large dividend cut and continues lower after a large dividend cut. (See below for notes.) statistical data Dividend Change Median 12 month price return before announcement Median 3 month price return after announcement Median Adjusted Dividend Payout Ratio before announcement Median Dividend Yield before announcement Percent with negative EPS before announcement Count of occurrences Big Cut -14% -15% 100% 4% 25% 477 Small Cut 0% -1% 91% 6% 11% 171 Stay the Same 10% 2% 44% 2% 10% 26,127 Small Raise 12% 4% 45% 2% 4% 5,297 Big Raise 20% 5% 23% 1% 9% 1,616 Figure 5. Source Schwab Center for Financial Research. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Note: This table groups dividend paying stocks from the Russell 1000 Index into buckets based on the change in their dividend. Stocks were monitored from 2010 to 2020. Stocks with a dividend cut of 20% or more were grouped into the bucket labeled \"Big Cut.” Stocks with a big cut in their dividend had a median stock price decline of 14% before the announcement of the cut and the stock price continued to fall by a median of 15% in the quarter after the announcement. These companies had a median adjusted dividend payout ratio of 100%. When earnings are negative, the dividend payout ratio loses meaning, so it was adjusted to be 100% for those stocks with negative earnings. In contrast, stocks that raised their dividend by 20% or more (grouped into the bucket \"Big Raise\") had a median price return of 20% in the year before the announcement, continued to appreciate after the announcement, and had a dividend payout ratio of just 23%. Compared to stocks that raised their dividend, stocks that cut their dividend had higher dividend yields and were more likely to have negative earnings. The bottom line Consider using a trend-following approach to technical analysis and setting price alerts on Schwab.com to initiate a review of the company\\'s fundamentals. If those fundamentals are deteriorating, especially if the dividend payout ratio rises above 100% of earnings, then give serious consideration to selling the stock in an effort to avoid a potential dividend cut. Adopting this method as part of your trade strategy may give you peace of mind, because you\\'ll have the tools and resources to help you determine when it\\'s time to sell. If you need additional help to keep you on track with your long term investing goals, you may want to consider enlisting a financial professional to help manage your dividend stock portfolio.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Options trading is becoming more popular among investors, yet a lot of people don’t understand the tax implications of these transactions. Investors may be surprised by how complex the taxation of options can be. Let’s look at the key factors you need to consider when it comes to buying and selling options on the open market. The language of taxes versus investing The IRS has its own lingo when it comes to investing, which doesn’t match up perfectly with the language used within the financial industry. Though many people may consider themselves to be “traders” (aka day traders or active traders), to the IRS, you’re likely just seen as an “investor.” To be considered a trader by the IRS you must be in the “business of trading,” which basically means trading is your day job. This article will focus on the tax implications of buying and selling options for “investors.” For those who feel they may qualify as being in the “business of trading,” we recommend meeting with a tax professional and reading the following IRS resources, IRS publication 550 and IRS Topic No. 429 Traders in Securities. Categories of options For tax purposes, options can be classified into three main categories: Employee stock options: These are generally options contracts given to employees as a form of compensation. For example, incentive stock options. Equity options: Options contracts on equities that can be traded on the open market. For example, puts or calls on individual stocks or on ETFs that hold stocks. Non-equity options: As the name infers, these are options contracts on something other than equities or ETFs, which can include commodities, futures or a broad-based stock market index. The IRS often refers to these options as “section 1256 contracts.” These types of options can also be traded on the open market. Examples include puts or calls on gold, pork belly futures, and even the S&P 500 index (more on this later). Taxation of employee stock options Though employee stock options aren’t traded on the open market, they are a common form of option held by many people. Here are a few high-level points you should know about them. These option contracts are usually granted by an employer to attract new employees, or to reward and retain current ones. There are two primary types of employee stock options: non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options. Generally, the gains from exercising non-qualified stock options are treated as ordinary income, whereas gains from an incentive stock option can be either treated as ordinary income or can be taxed at a preferential rate, if certain requirements are met. To learn more about employee stock options, see “How Should Equity Compensation Fit Into Your Financial Plan” and “Understanding the Risks of Employee Stock Options.” Taxation of equity options The taxation of equity options is different for a long position (where you’re the buyer of the option) versus a short position (where you’re the seller/writer of the option). For those who have long or short options contracts, the tables below provide an overview of how these contracts are generally taxed. But be aware, if you’re doing more complex options transactions, such as spreads or butterflies, the IRS may consider those trades to be “straddle” contracts, which means they could be taxed differently (see below for more details). Long options Long Options (buy) If position is closed before the expiration If you exercise the option If the option expires Long Options (buy) Long Call > If position is closed before the expiration The holding period of the option determines if it's taxed at short- or long-term capital tax rates. > If you exercise the option Exercising a call option increases the cost basis of the stock purchased. There is not a taxable event until stock is sold, and the hold period of the stock determines if the capital gain or loss is short- or long-term. > If the option expires The holding period of the option determines if the capital loss is short- or long-term. > Long Options (buy) Long Put > If position is closed before the expiration Same as above. > If you exercise the option Exercising a put option reduces the amount realized from the sale of the underlying stock by the cost of the put. > If the option expires Same as above. > Short options Short Options (sell/write) If position is closed before the expiration If the option is exercised (assigned to you) If the option expires Short Options (sell/write) Short Call > If position is closed before the expiration Regardless of holding period, the capital gain or loss is always considered short-term. > If the option is exercised (assigned to you) The amount you received for writing the option increases the amount received from the sale of the stock. Depending on your holding period of the stock, the capital gain or loss is short- or long-term. > If the option expires Report the amount received for writing the option as short-term capital gain. > Short Options (sell/write) Short Put > If position is closed before the expiration Same as above. > If the option is exercised (assigned to you) If the put option is exercised and you buy the underlying stock, decrease the cost basis in the stock by the amount received for writing the option. Your holding period for the stock begins on the date you buy it. > If the option expires Same as above. > Taxation of complex equity options strategies Numerous options strategies are available to investors, such as writing covered calls, using spreads, straddles, strangles, butterflies, etc. Unfortunately, this is another situation where the IRS does not use the same language as investors, and that can lead to some confusion. The IRS groups most of these complex options strategies together and refers to them as a “straddle.” For tax purposes, a straddle occurs when you’re holding an options contract that offsets or substantially reduces the risk of loss to another position you’re also holding. For example, say you own stock in XYZ corporation and that stock in currently trading for $80 per share. If you bought a put option at a $70 strike price to protect against downside price movement, you have in essence limited your down-side risk, which means the IRS would consider that option to be a straddle and you must defer your loss (cost) on the put option. The idea behind the straddle taxation rules is to prevent investors from deducting losses before an offsetting gain is recognized. Here are the basics you need to know about how straddles are taxed: Losses on straddles are generally deferred: If only one side of a straddle position is closed, any realized losses are generally not deductible until the offsetting position is also closed out. Any losses are included in the basis of the remaining position and eventually recognized when the final position is closed. Note: Any loss that exceeds the unrecognized gain from an offsetting position can generally be deducted. Qualified covered calls (QCCs) are not subject to the straddle rules: The IRS groups covered calls into two categories, unqualified or qualified, and each is taxed differently. Generally, QCCs are options written with an expiration date greater than 30 days and a strike price that is not “deep-in-the-money” (see IRS Publication 550 to learn more). If the covered call does not meet these requirements, then it’s considered “unqualified” and is taxed as a straddle. Offsetting section 1256 options are exempt from this rule: Straddles consisting entirely of Section 1256 options are not taxed as straddles (see more below). The wash sale rules generally apply to options The same wash sale rules that apply to stock also apply to stock option trades. If a substantially identical security is acquired within 30 days before or after the sale occurs, the loss is disallowed and the basis is transferred to the new position. Non-equity options taxation Internal Revenue Code section 1256 requires options contracts on futures, commodities, currencies and broad-based equity indices to be taxed at a 60/40 split between the long and short term capital gains rates. This rule means the taxation of profits and losses from non-equity options are not affected by how long you hold them. Section 1256 options are always taxed as follows: 60% of the gain or loss is taxed at the long-term capital tax rates 40% of the gain or loss is taxed at the short-term capital tax rates Note: The taxation of options contracts on exchange traded funds (ETF) that hold section 1256 assets is not always clear. Consult with a tax professional if you hold these types of investments. In addition to the 60/40 split rule, if you hold section 1256 options contracts over year-end into the new year, you’ll be required to recognize an unrealized gain or loss each year based on the fair market value on Dec. 31. This is known as the marked-to-market rule, and it applies even if you don’t sell that option. This activity also resets your cost basis (higher or lower) for the next calendar year. In addition, section 1256 contracts are not subject to the same wash sale rules as equity options. Bottom line The taxation of options can be even more complex than what was described above. That’s why we recommend that anyone who trades options consider working with a tax professional who has experience in options taxation so that you don’t end up paying more in taxes than is necessary.

       "   'abstract': 'The American Rescue Plan Act includes much more than stimulus payments, especially if your children are minors.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, With most eligible individuals having already received their $1,400 stimulus payments, it's easy to overlook some of the other benefits of the recent American Rescue Plan. Of course, the extra money up front will make a significant difference to many struggling families. And even if you're caught up on your bills, these economic impact payments could be a welcome boost to your emergency fund—or to your investments. But beyond the stimulus payments, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) has a number of additional benefits for families that I want to highlight. Even if some don't apply to you, for instance if you don't have minor children, you might be able to pass on the information to family and friends who could take advantage of them. Here are some I think are worth noting. More money for the Child Tax Credit in 2021—and a new way to get it Parents with minor children get a big increase in the Child Tax Credit—from the previous $2,000 per child up to age 16 to $3,000 for kids 6-17, and $3,600 for kids under 6. Plus, this credit is now fully refundable, meaning it reduces your tax bill dollar for dollar and any amount over your tax bill will be refunded to you in cash. Beginning in July through December 2021, parents are scheduled to receive the credit in monthly payments (which would amount to half the yearly credit) and apply the remainder to their 2021 taxes. Of course, there are income limitations for the expanded credit (they phase out beginning at $75,000 for single filers; $150,000 married filing jointly), but for those who qualify, it offers a welcome boost. For example, a family with married parents filing jointly, three kids ages 5, 9 and 12 and adjusted gross income (AGI) of $125,000 would get a fully refundable tax credit of $9,600—with monthly payments of $800 for the 2nd half of 2021. In other words, individuals eligible for a 2021 Child Tax Credit will receive advance payments of the credit through monthly payments from July 1 to December 31, 2021. This change will allow families to receive the benefit sooner rather than waiting until the 2022 tax filing season to receive it. Higher earners (topping out at $200,000 for single filers; $400,000 married filing jointly) are still eligible for the regular child tax credit of $2,000 per child. Unless extended, the child tax credit rules for 2022 will revert back to those in place for 2020. Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit maximums and income limits increased for this year In another welcome increase for parents, the maximum expenses used to calculate child and dependent care tax credit for kids under 13 goes up to $8,000 for one child; $16,000 for multiple children. Plus, the maximum percentage you can receive increases from the current 35 percent to 50 percent of expenses—and the credit is fully refundable. On top of that, the AGI limit for eligible families to receive the full credit increases to $125,000 with the credit phasing out between $125,000 and $400,000. So adding on to the example above, if that same family with three kids was paying $24,000 annually for childcare, the parents could claim the full $16,000 maximum for expenses and get an $8,000 (50% x $16,000) Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit in addition to the $9,600 Child Tax Credit. This tax credit also applies to other qualified dependents. Temporary assistance with health insurance premiums Paying for quality healthcare is another big concern for families, especially if you've lost coverage through a job due to the pandemic. Here are two ways the ARPA can help: COBRA subsidies for laid-off workers—From April 1 through September 30, 2021, the government will provide 100 percent premium assistance for eligible unemployed individuals to help them keep their previous employer-sponsored health insurance. Premium caps for ACA health insurance—Individuals who buy health insurance through the federal exchange or state marketplaces will have premiums capped at 8.5 percent of income, replacing prior income caps through 2022. This will allow more people to qualify for healthcare subsidies called premium tax credits. Get the details and talk to a tax advisor The ARPA offers more benefits for families—including the expansion of the Retirement Savers and Earned Income Tax Credits, emergency housing/rental assistance and more—but the details go beyond the scope of this column. You can get more information from the U.S Department of the Treasury. Also, be aware that while you don't have to file a tax return to get the economic stimulus payment, you do need to file to get a tax refund or qualify for any refundable tax credits. I'd suggest talking to a tax advisor who can help you understand and take full advantage of the benefits that apply to you. This past year the pandemic has threatened people's financial health as well as their physical health. The good news is that there is a wide range of assistance available. Get the information you need and pass it on to those you care about. It could go a long way in providing help and hope as we look to a brighter future. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'Many college graduates work to pay off student loans, and as a result, investing can be put on hold—but you don’t have to prioritize one over the other.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Every year, millions of college graduates join the workforce while Boomers begin to transition into retirement. Landing that first post-grad job is a pivotal milestone for all students, but unlike their predecessors, many in the younger generations are tackling a dilemma few others have faced: Save for retirement or pay off student loans? When the first Boomers reached college age in 1964, annual tuition for a full-time student at a four-year public institution averaged about $2,000 in today’s dollars.1 For the 2019-2020 school year, annual tuition at a four-year public institution averaged about $9,425 and continues to increase every year.2 As a result, students in younger generations have resorted to loans, with more than 6 in 10 (62%) of graduating seniors from public and non-profit colleges averaging about $28,950 in student loan debt.3 If you’re trying to repay student loan debt, it’s tempting to postpone saving for less immediate needs such as emergency savings, retirement and even marriage. In fact, among college graduates with student loans, 34% have delayed emergency savings, 23% have delayed buying a home, 29% have delayed retirement savings and 9% have delayed getting married.4 This is a problem. When you delay saving, you miss out on the benefits of compounding during those years. Even small amounts can add up to significant accumulated earnings by the time you’re 65. You shouldn’t have to choose one over the other. With careful planning, you can develop a strategy to tackle student debt while also saving for retirement. Consider the following steps: 1. First, make the minimum loan payments. The cardinal rule of student loan repayment is: don’t miss payments. Make sure you’re making the minimum payment on every loan and that the amount is manageable within your monthly budget. If it’s not, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has resources that describe how you can renegotiate your loan with federal and private lenders. The important thing is to address the problem quickly. As you repay your loan, you’re establishing your credit history, and your student loan interest payments may be tax-deductible if your adjusted gross income is less than $85,000. So, there’s an upside to making minimum payments on time. 2. Next, if there’s money left over, take advantage of your company’s 401(k) match. Your next priority is to consider retirement savings. Look into your employer’s 401(k) plan—or any similar qualified workplace retirement plan. Some employers match 50 cents to the dollar for every dollar you contribute, up to a certain limit (often 5 or 6 percent of your salary). This “free money” can add up and have a significant impact over time, so if your employer does offer matching contributions, make sure to contribute enough to get the match. 3. No workplace retirement plan? Consider opening up a Roth or traditional IRA. Even if your employer doesn’t offer a retirement plan, you can still make tax-advantaged contributions to a retirement account. In 2021, you can save up to $6,000 a year in a traditional IRA and get an up-front tax deduction. Alternatively, you can save the same amount in a Roth IRA and forgo the tax deduction today, but enjoy potential tax-deferred growth and tax-free withdrawals on qualified distributions in the future.5 Also, if your income is less than $66,000 as a joint filer or less than $33,000 as a single filer you might be eligible for a credit for your retirement savings contributions to a 401(k) or an IRA of up to $1,000 ($2,000 if married filing jointly) from the IRS through the Saver's Credit. 4. Put additional funds against your highest-interest-rate loan. If you have multiple student loans—and assuming no other high-cost, nondeductible debt (such as credit card debt, which should be paid off first, or an emergency fund)—focus any extra money on the loan charging the most interest. If you’re fortunate enough to have only one low-interest loan, consider making the minimum payment while investing in the market. While investing involves risks and you could lose money in the market, you may also gain more from investment returns over the long run than you’ll pay in interest. 5. Use windfalls wisely. Windfalls can be exciting, but they should be managed carefully. If you should get a windfall, whether in the form of a gift, bonus or inheritance, take the time to weigh your options. You could use the money to reduce your student debt and save for the future. The bottom line Juggling student debt can be tricky, but investing in your future is worth it. College graduates can successfully manage loan repayment while saving for retirement. 1Based on 1964-65 school year, and expressed in constant dollars as of the 2018-19 school year (in other words, the value expressed in dollars adjusted for changes in purchasing power since 1964).

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I’m a single mom with a decent income, but I’m always living paycheck to paycheck. How can I break that cycle and start to save not only for an emergency, but also for my bigger goals like retirement and someday maybe even a home? —A Reader Dear Reader, Living paycheck to paycheck isn't uncommon these days. Recent studies suggest many Americans are doing just that, which in turn makes it next to impossible to save and invest. Overspending can be part of the problem, but even more often people get squeezed through no fault of their own—low wages, unpredictable income and high costs for essentials like childcare, healthcare, housing and college. On the other hand, even people with high incomes can find themselves caught in a seemingly never-ending cycle. When you’re in this situation and just barely making ends meet each month, it can seem as though you’re on an endless financial treadmill. So how do you jump off? It's a combination of attitude and action. First realize that you can do it—then take these steps to make it happen. Start by tracking your spending with an eye toward saving To get a handle on your money, you first need to know where it's going. Tracking your expenses—for at least 30 days—will give you a realistic picture of how you're spending and help you prioritize and make changes. Start with essential costs for housing (rent/mortgage, utilities), food, insurance, and work down from there. Is savings on your list? If not, it should be. In fact, it's the essential that's going to break the paycheck to paycheck pattern. So one of the first important steps is to make savings a priority. It's okay to start small. Research from FINRA and SaverLife shows that households with as little as $100 in savings are generally more satisfied with their finances. The key is to save consistently. Now take a closer look. What are you spending on nonessentials? Ordering out or multiple streaming subscriptions may be nice-to-haves, but these are the things you can control and cut back—and move that money to savings. Take a good look at your debt—and your attitude toward it It’s okay to borrow. I’ve talked before about good debt and bad debt. You can barely get by without a credit card these days. Most students need to borrow money for college. Most homebuyers take out a mortgage. That kind of borrowing can make sense. The danger comes when you borrow too much or use borrowed money to pay for an unsustainable lifestyle. New research shows that some people get into trouble because they think of borrowed money as their own. But it’s not. It’s the lender’s. And eventually the lender wants that money back—with interest. High interest consumer debt like credit cards is just about the worst kind—and will keep you on that financial treadmill. So if you have it, the next step is to get out of it. How exactly? Again, it's that important combination of attitude and action. Start by cutting down on using cards. Pick one or two and put the others away. Commit to using cash or a debit card whenever possible. Then come up with a realistic repayment plan, focusing extra money on your highest interest card while paying the minimum on any others. Set up automatic payments where possible. Debt consolidation can also be a solution, but make sure you understand how it works. As for paying down debts when you’re really pinched, prioritize secured debt like a mortgage and car payments over unsecured debt like credit cards. Talk to your service providers and lenders to let them know of your situation if you’re struggling. Most of all, don't take on more debt—no matter how enticing the offer. Expect the unexpected When you're juggling to pay for what's happening now, it can seem impossible to put anything toward what might happen in the future. But if you don't, the unexpected—a job loss, accident or illness—could put you in an even bigger financial bind. That's why an emergency fund is a must for everyone. While I encourage people to target 3-6 months of essential expenses in a rainy day fund, if you’re just starting out aim for $1,000-$2,000. And while you're thinking about emergencies, don't forget about insurance. Health insurance is a must, as well as auto insurance, homeowners or renters insurance, and possibly disability insurance. Sure, there’s a cost, but insurance can save you money by protecting you from financial disaster. Shop around, and get the right coverage in place. Look for ways to increase income and opportunity If you’ve cut expenses to the bone and are still having a hard time saving, look for ways to increase your income. This can mean part-time employment, side-hustles, or turning a hobby into a money-making enterprise. Consider improving your skills with advanced designations, higher education or training that can make you more valuable to an employer. You might even be able to make more with your current skills. The Federal Reserve has a new tool to help you look for higher paying jobs similar to the one you have. It's worth checking out. Avoid lifestyle creep Not living paycheck to paycheck means you have extra money—not just to spend but to save. That's where your mindset is especially important. For some people, having more money automatically means spending more. It's called lifestyle creep. Don't fall for it. Before you buy, ask yourself if the purchase will move you forward or set you back. Because no matter how much you earn, if you always spend as much—or more—than you make, you'll never break the cycle. Set some goals There's nothing like having something to save for to keep you motivated. Whether it's a special night out next month or a big purchase next year, put a price tag on it and give yourself a timeline for achieving it. And don't forget about long-term goals like retirement. Take advantage of a 401(k); contribute what you can to an IRA. Knowing you're working toward the future can make you feel more confident today. Be positive—and patient Struggling with money is stressful, but I believe you have the power to turn things around. Start with small positive steps. Think of the money you save rather than spend as paying yourself. And as it all adds up—and it will—put your savings to work by investing. All of this takes time and commitment, but you can do it. You just have to start. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com. Carrie cannot respond to questions directly, but your topic may be considered for a future article.

Here are seven types of taxes that could apply if you buy muni bonds. 1. De minimis tax. The de minimis tax applies to munis that you acquired at a market discount. The de minimis rule says that for bonds purchased at a discount of more than 0.25% for each full year from the time of purchase to maturity, gains resulting from the discount are taxed as ordinary income rather than capital gains. The ordinary income tax rate is generally greater than the capital gains rate, which could result in a greater bite out of your yield. The NutFor example, take a bond that matures in 10 years with a face value of 100. The de minimis “breakpoint” on this bond is 97.5 (100 – [0.25 × 10 years]). If you bought this bond for less than 97.5, you would be required to pay ordinary income tax on the discount.

The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. What you can do: To avoid the de minimis tax rule, consider purchasing bonds priced at par or at a premium to their face value. Paying a premium may mean having to make adjustments to your tax filing, but the associated tax benefits more than offset the added complication, in our view. In addition, if a bond is selling at a premium, it’s likely because it is offering a high coupon rate. 2. Alternative minimum tax. There are two parallel income tax systems in the United States: ordinary income tax and alternative minimum tax (AMT), which disallows a number of deductions that are allowed in the ordinary income tax code. Taxpayers must calculate their tax under each system, then pay whichever is higher—ordinary or AMT. Income from some municipal bonds—for example, those that fund stadiums, airports or more businesslike enterprises—might be subject to AMT. If you have to pay AMT and hold such a bond, your interest income would generally be taxed at the applicable AMT rate—which could be 26% or more, if you’re in the AMT exemption phase-out range. Effectively, that means the yield on a municipal bond paying 2.00% would drop to 1.48%. The 2017 tax law increased the phase-out thresholds for AMT meaning fewer filers will be subject to AMT under the new tax laws. The phase-out threshold is $1,047,200 for 2021 for married filing jointly. What you can do: For bonds held at Schwab, you can find out if a municipal bond is subject to AMT by accessing the “Research” page after logging into schwab.com, searching for a municipal bond and viewing its “Security Description” page. You can also contact a Schwab Fixed Income Specialist at 877-566-7982. 3. Increase in taxation of Social Security benefits. Although municipal bonds generally aren’t subject to federal taxes, the IRS does include income from such bonds in your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) when determining how much of your Social Security benefit is taxable. If half of your Social Security benefit plus other income, including tax-exempt municipal bond interest, amounts to more than $44,000 for a joint return ($34,000 for individual), up to 85% of your Social Security benefits may be taxable. What you can do: If you are receiving Social Security benefits, we suggest reviewing IRS Publication 915, “Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits,” or this page from the Social Security Administration, which both discuss the taxation of retirement benefits, to determine how this might apply to your individual situation. 4. Increase in Medicare premiums. If you’re covered by Medicare, the federally tax-exempt interest from municipal bonds may increase the amount you pay for Medicare Part B or Medicare prescription drug coverage. If you’re married and filing jointly and your MAGI is more than $170,000 ($85,000 for single filers), you will be required to pay an additional amount for Medicare Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage. Income to determine monthly Medicare premiums may include municipal bond interest Income to determine monthly Medicare premiums may include municipal bond interest Modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) - individuals Modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) - married couples Part B monthly premium amount Prescription drug company monthly premium amount Less than $88,000 Less than $176,000 2021 standard premium = $148.50 Your plan premium $88,000 up to $111,000 $176,000 up to $222,000 Standard premium + $59.40 Your plan premium + $12.30 $111,000 up to $138,000 $222,000 up to $276,000 Standard premium + $148.50 Your plan premium + $31.80 $138,000 up to $165,000 $276,000 up to $330,000 Standard premium + $237.60 Your plan premium + $51.20 $165,000 up to $500,000 $330,000 up to $750,000 Standard premium + $326.70 Your plan premium + $70.70 Equal to or above $500,000 Equal to or above $750,000 Standard premium + $356.40 Your plan premium + $77.10 Source Social Security Administration. Data obtained on 3/31/2021. To determine your Medicare premiums, the Social Security Administration generally uses your most recent federal tax return. For example, to determine 2021 monthly adjustment amounts, the Social Security Administration would use your tax return for tax year 2019. You can learn more about Medicare premiums in the Social Security Administration publication “Medicare Premiums: Rules For Higher-Income Beneficiaries.” What you can do: We don’t believe paying an additional Medicare premium justifies not investing in municipal bonds. Given that your MAGI will also include income from other sources, such as dividend income and interest income from taxable bonds, avoiding municipal bonds will not necessarily allow you to avoid the increase in Medicare premiums. Also, investing in zero-coupon bonds likely won’t allow you to avoid paying higher premiums, because the part of the increase in the zero-coupon bonds’ value may be included in the calculation to determine your Medicare premiums. 5. Capital gains tax. We generally suggest individual investors hold a bond until maturity. However, if you need to sell earlier and you receive a price greater than your cost basis—your acquisition price after adjusting for any premiums paid or discounts received—the gain will be subject to capital gains tax. What you can do: Determining cost basis for an individual bond can get complicated, as there are special reporting rules that govern the adjustments to a bond’s acquisition price. For bonds held at Schwab, you can find your adjusted cost basis on the “Positions” page after you log into schwab.com. 6. State income tax. If you purchase a bond from your home state, generally the interest payments you receive will be exempt from state income taxes. However, interest paid on bonds from outside of your home state typically will be subject to state income tax. Interest payments on some in-state munis may also be subject to state income taxes. What you can do: If you live in a state with low tax rates or one that issues a minimal amount of municipal bonds, we would suggest looking outside your home state. The added benefits of diversification and potentially higher yields might make up for the hit you would take by paying state income taxes. 7. Taxable municipal bonds. Some munis are taxable. For example, roughly 30% of the munis issued in 2020 were taxable. Issuance of taxable munis has increased recently as a result of the 2017 tax law changes and low absolute yields. Taxable muni bonds generally yield more than tax-free bonds to make up for the difference. What you can do: For investors in lower tax brackets and investing in taxable accounts, or those investing in either Roth or traditional IRA accounts, we believe taxable municipal bonds can make sense compared to other taxable bonds because, historically, munis have exhibited stronger credit characteristics than corporate bonds of comparable ratings. The bottom line is that municipal bonds offer significant tax advantages and could make sense in the portfolios of many income-focused investors. However, the details matter. If you are highly tax-sensitive and would like to invest in these securities, you will want to make sure you understand how the tax traps mentioned above might affect your portfolio. If you have questions about your portfolio, you could consult IRS Publication 550, “Investment Income and Expenses,” or check in with your tax advisor.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Designating beneficiaries on your investment accounts can easily slip to the bottom of your to-do list. But this task shouldn’t be forgotten. It can help protect a sizeable portion of your estate and ensure that your assets go to the right people once you pass away. Here’s why beneficiary designations should play an essential role in your estate plan: They’re powerful. You can specify who should inherit your retirement and life insurance assets without making adjustments to your will or trusts. In fact, these designations take precedence over wills and trusts in most cases. They’re virtually probate-proof. Because these designations generally supersede will and trust instructions, they circumvent the probate process and ensure that assets can be transferred to heirs without delay. However, if a designated beneficiary predeceases the owner and there is no contingent beneficiary, probate will likely be required. They’re simple. Many institutions offer the convenience of updating these beneficiary designations by paper or online. And here’s when you should consider making updates to your designations: Family changes. Marriage, divorce, the birth of a child or grandchild, the loss of a spouse or child—all these events can prompt a change in beneficiary decisions. Keeping your beneficiaries up to date ensures that you don’t inadvertently leave money to the wrong people or leave a loved one out of your plan. Just in case a designated beneficiary predeceases you, making a \"per stirpes\" distribution election can allow the beneficiary\\'s children to inherit their share. Money moves. If you recently rolled over a 401(k) from a former employer or transferred an existing IRA to a new financial firm, your beneficiary designations won’t transfer over with your assets. Make sure you take the time to specify them again. Finally, make sure you coordinate beneficiary designations with your overall estate plan.

       "   'abstract': \"When it comes to maintaining good credit, don't let myths and misconceptions fool you into bad decisions.\",\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, April Fools\\' Day can make for a good joke, but there are certain myths about money that, if not dispelled quickly, are no laughing matter. And misconceptions about credit and debt are right at the top of the list. Here are 10 common myths about credit that can lead to financial trouble. Don\\'t fall for them! Myth 1) A credit score is only important if you need to borrow money. If only it were that simple. Of course, your credit score impacts your ability to borrow, but nowadays it can affect many other areas of your life, including: Interest rates—Whether you\\'re looking to finance a home, a car or a washer and dryer, the better your credit score, the lower the interest rate you may be offered. Renting a new home—A prospective landlord can run a credit check to see if you\\'re a good risk. Things like late payments and collections not only lower your score, they can be a deal breaker when it comes to renting. Insurance premiums—In some states, insurance companies use credit-based insurance scores to determine your premiums. A poor credit score can increase your costs for home and auto insurance. Job prospects—More and more companies use your credit history when screening for jobs. This can impact your ability to get—and keep—a job, as well as your eligibility for a promotion. Security clearance or military deployment—For federal workers in national security positions including members of the military, late payments, collections, bounced checks, large debts or credit report errors can upend your career, jeopardizing deployment or a promotion. Myth 2) Carrying a high balance helps build credit faster. That\\'s false. The only thing carrying a credit card balance builds is your interest payment—and the total cost of what you financed. To build credit, it\\'s much better to pay off what you charge each month and never carry a balance. Myth 3) As long as you don\\'t go over your credit card limit you\\'re fine. Wrong. In fact, to improve your credit score it\\'s best to use less than 30 percent of your credit line to keep your \"debt utilization\" rate low. Debt utilization is the amount you borrow relative to the amount you\\'re able to borrow. A high utilization rate—or even an increase in the amount of credit you\\'re using—can flag you as a higher risk, lower your credit score and raise your interest rate. Myth 4) Closing out credit cards will improve your score. Wrong again—for a couple of reasons. First, closing cards decreases your available credit and increases your debt utilization ratio, making it look like you\\'re borrowing at a higher percentage. Second, closing cards can reduce the average age of your accounts, making you seem like a newer borrower, which can lower your score. However, closing a credit card can help you manage spending and protect you from identity theft if you\\'re not using the account. If you decide to close a card, you may want to adjust your spending or pay down existing balances at the same time to keep your debt utilization ratio steady. Myth 5) Getting married merges your credit history. Even when you say \"I do,\" your credit histories always remain separate, unless there\\'s a joint account or authorized user. In that case, there\\'s a shared history, and you\\'re jointly liable for any charges. If you\\'re divorced or separated, a joint account still means joint liability, and any new or unpaid debts can affect your credit score. I suggest every couple openly discuss their attitudes toward credit and debt early in their relationship. Myth 6) You can pay a company to quickly remove bad credit marks from your history. Accurate negative credit information can stay on your credit report for up to seven years. Bankruptcies can stay on your report for up to ten years. In fact, no one can remove negative information such as late payments from a credit report if it\\'s accurate, no matter what a credit \"repair\" company promises you. Use caution before signing up with any company that offers credit repair or counseling services. Myth 7) Checking your credit report will negatively impact your score. Absolutely not. You\\'re entitled to receive a free credit report annually from each of the three major credit rating bureaus (Equifax, Experian, Transunion), and I highly recommend getting them. Just go to annualcreditreport.com. Myth 8) There is only one credit score. Actually, there are quite a few credit scores, and different rating agencies often have more than one. You can even have different credit scores from the same agency because scores are calculated at different times and according to different criteria. For instance, FICO recently made changes to its criteria, which I discussed in a previous column. The important thing for consumers to understand is what basic factors go into a credit score: payment history, unpaid debts, age of accounts, debt utilization ratio, new credit applications and types of credit. Myth 9) Shopping for credit will hurt your credit score. This is less straightforward. It depends on how you shop, the type of credit you\\'re shopping for and your timeline. For instance, applying for multiple credit cards within a short time can have a bigger negative impact on your credit score than shopping for a home or auto loan. In general, comparison-shopping within 14 to 45 days for an auto loan or mortgage is considered a single inquiry. But trying for a mortgage and a car loan at the same time could have a negative impact. That said, it makes sense to shop around. To minimize any negative impact, pull your credit report in advance to check for errors, and concentrate your rate shopping into a short amount of time. Myth 10) Having more credit cards improves your credit score. This also is a potential yes/no situation. Having multiple credit cards can improve your credit history. But it can also tempt you to spend more and be late on payments, which would lower your score. Ultimately, the best way to improve your credit is to borrow responsibly. Understand these myths and you won\\'t be fooled into taking on too much debt—a financial prank to avoid any time of year. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

The basics A 529 plan is a state-sponsored program that allows parents, relatives and friends to invest in a child’s (or any person’s) K-12 and college education. Almost all states and the District of Columbia offer some type of 529 plan. However, you don’t have to live in a particular state to take advantage of its plan. The term “qualified higher education expense” includes up to $10,000 in annual expenses for tuition in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary school, secondary public, private or religious school. Be sure to check with the school’s state 529 plan rules to see if it permits this option. It’s important to remember that a 529 account belongs to you. While your child is the beneficiary, you remain in charge of the money, which is managed by a fund manager assigned by the state. Most 529 college savings plans allow you to choose from a variety of predetermined asset allocation portfolios that range from conservative to aggressive, based on historic risk and potential return. Your plan may offer a choice between an age-based portfolio and a static portfolio. With an age-based portfolio, the fund manager adjusts the asset allocation from more aggressive to conservative as your child nears college age. With a static portfolio, the asset allocation stays the same until you make a change, which you can now do twice per calendar year. How to open and contribute to a 529 plan Parents, grandparents and other family members can open a 529 account on behalf of a child or adult at a brokerage or other financial institution, or directly with a state. A person can be the beneficiary of more than one 529 plan at the same time, but you’ll want to make sure the combined contributions don’t exceed the state’s contribution limit. Most 529 college savings plans allow you to open an account with a small amount—say $25 or $50 a month—if you sign up for an automatic investing plan, with the 529 contributions coming directly from your bank or brokerage account. Also, be sure to ask whether your employer allows you to make 529 contributions automatically as a payroll deduction, which is a benefit some companies offer. Tax advantages Earnings in a 529 plan grow federally tax-deferred, which means your money has a chance to compound faster because you don’t have to pay taxes on current investment income or capital gains. Even better, withdrawals are tax-free as long as you use the money to pay for qualified education expenses, which typically include tuition, books, school supplies and room and board. Contributions to a 529 are after-tax and not federally tax deductible. However, if you invest in your own state’s 529 plan or if your state is a “tax parity state,” you may benefit from state income tax deductions on contributions or state tax exemptions on withdrawals.1 You can typically contribute up to $15,000 a year (or $30,000 for couples) without incurring the gift tax. It’s also possible to contribute a lump sum of up to $75,000 to one or more 529 college savings plan in a single year ($150,000 for couples) without being subject to the gift tax. The IRS views the money as an annual $15,000 (or $30,000 for couples) gift over five years. However, if you contribute more money on behalf of the same child during those five years, you may trigger the gift tax. States can also put a cap on how much can accumulate in a 529 account. Most states set the limit in the $300,000–$400,000 per beneficiary range, though some states have higher limits. Effect on financial aid Financial aid formulas typically consider 20% of the assets held in a child’s name available for education expenses. But, as previously mentioned, a 529 plan is considered your asset, not your child’s. As a result, only 5.64% of the money is generally considered available for college expenses after the asset protection allowance (APA). If another family member (like a grandparent) or non-relative owns the 529 plan, the account assets won’t factor into federal financial aid calculations. However, withdrawals in support of a grandchild will factor into his or her Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or College Scholarship Service Profile (CSS/PROFILE®) calculations two years after the distribution is made.2 In other words, distributions made in a grandchild’s freshman year of college could diminish his or her financial aid during junior year. Knowing that, one strategy to consider with a grandparent-owned 529 account is to hold off taking any distributions until the last two years of college. That would ensure the distributions won’t affect a grandchild’s financial aid eligibility. Saving for college is a wise move, even if you believe your child or grandchild may qualify for financial aid. Remember, the majority of financial aid comes in the form of loans, which must be repaid with interest. Scholarships If your child receives a scholarship and you decide to withdraw the money from a 529 account instead of changing beneficiaries, you’ll have to pay ordinary income taxes on any earnings above the amount you contributed. If the withdrawal is more than the amount of the scholarship, you’ll have to pay an additional 10% penalty on earnings for the amount in excess of the scholarship.3 If you withdraw less, the 10% penalty does not apply. If you simply withdraw the money from your account for any non-qualified purpose, you’ll have to pay federal income taxes as well as a 10% penalty on the full withdrawal amount. Non-qualified 529 withdrawals may also be subject to recapture of state tax credits or deductions that you received when making contributions. Consult with a qualified tax advisor for specifics. 529 prepaid tuition plans If you know your child will attend a public school in your state, you may be able to take advantage of an alternate 529 plan that allows you to prepay tomorrow’s college tuition at today’s prices. A 529 prepaid tuition plan provides certain guarantees for tuition and certain expenses at any in-state public school. Some prepaid plans cover tuition, fees, and room and board, while others only cover tuition and fees. If your child ends up attending an out-of-state or private school, state prepaid tuition plans can be transferred toward these more expensive options; however, they usually only pay the average in-state tuition cost. There is also a prepaid 529 plan for a consortium of specific private schools. Alternate options for 529s If your child decides not to attend college, the funds can be used at any eligible educational institution offering higher education beyond high school, including some overseas, trade or vocational schools eligible to participate in a student aid program run by the U.S. Department of Education. You can see a list of eligible schools on the U.S. Federal Student Aid Code List. Funds can also be used to pay for books, supplies and equipment for apprenticeship programs registered and certified with the Secretary of Labor under the National Apprenticeship Act. You can see a list of apprenticeship programs on Apprenticeship.gov. If there’s money left in your account after your child graduates, you can change the beneficiary to another qualified family member—including yourself. The IRS broadly defines the term family member to include everyone from the original beneficiary’s siblings and parents to step-siblings and in-laws. You can also make a withdrawal up to $10,000 to pay for qualified student loans of the beneficiary or their siblings.4 Consider your options There are a number of resources for financial aid information, including the U.S. Department of Education and College Board. However, it’s always a good idea to check with your financial planner and a qualified tax advisor to determine which education savings route is best for you and your family. 1States that offer a “tax parity” tax deduction for contributing to a 529 plan, including out-of-state plans that may be more attractive than the in-state option, include Arizona, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana and Pennsylvania. 2About 400 schools and scholarships use CSS PROFILE® as part of their financial aid process. Additional financial assets and resources can be considered in the CSS PROFILE that are not considered in the FAFSA. Contact the institution for more information. 3Scholarships or grants are tax-free if the individual is a candidate for a degree at an eligible institution and the amounts are used for specific expenses. See IRS Publication 970 for more details. 4Student loan interest paid by any portion of the $10,000 as a tax-free withdrawal cannot also be deducted for federal taxes.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, In the fast-paced financial world we live in with its focus on trading trends, online platforms and market movements, it\\'s easy to get lost in the weeds and lose sight of the grounding principles of managing your money that are essential to long-term success. So with spring in the air and the buds on the vine, I thought it would be fun to focus on some of the financial lessons we can learn from the people who are more in touch with the land. If you\\'ve had any experience on a farm, you\\'ll know what I\\'m talking about. For instance, my father learned the reality of \"don\\'t put all your eggs in one basket\" in his first business venture as a young teen in Sacramento literally selling eggs—a lesson he understood firsthand when he got into investing! Read on for some other words of wisdom from those who work the land—both from folklore and a couple of well-known commentators—that get to the heart of smart money management. It might give you some new insights as well as a few smiles. \"Your fences need to be horse-high, pig-tight and bull-strong.\" To me, there\\'s a pretty clear message here: Be prepared, set boundaries and have all your safeguards in place. So what does this mean for your finances? Right away I think of the importance of setting goals and planning ahead to meet them, which also means creating a realistic budget that includes savings. A budget will help you set realistic financial boundaries so you know the space you have to work in. The next step is to fortify your space by having an emergency fund and the right insurance. Want to make your financial fences even stronger? Create a financial plan. Don\\'t make the mistake of thinking that\\'s too esoteric or only for the wealthy. A financial plan can help you answer some very down-to-earth questions to help fortify everyday finances for you and your family. \"Every path has a few puddles.\" You\\'ve probably made some good money choices and, like most everyone, you\\'ve probably made some mistakes. Financial \"puddles\" might be small things like blowing your budget now and then or bigger things like falling behind on retirement savings. But whatever the size of the puddle, rather than getting discouraged, figure out a way to get around it. By changing a few financial habits, you can make positive change. In fact, simple financial hacks like setting up automatic deductions from checking to savings, putting bills on auto-pay or creating a financial calendar can make it easy—almost automatic—to jump the financial puddles and keep going forward. \"If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging.\" Digging ourselves into a hole is a common metaphor for getting into too much debt. We know we need to stop, but the question is how. For a lot of folks, credit cards are a major cause of debt overload. So the first step is to cut down on using them. Pick just one card and put the others away. As much as you can, commit to using cash or paying off credit card balances immediately when possible. Then come up with a realistic repayment plan, focusing extra money on your highest interest card. Consider transferring balances to a lower-interest card (watch for balance transfer fees and grace periods!). Set up automatic payments. Debt in itself isn\\'t bad, but you have to manage it wisely so it doesn\\'t bury you. \"It is only the farmer who faithfully plants seeds in the Spring who reaps a harvest in the Autumn.\" I think this bit of wisdom from B.C. Forbes, founder of Forbes magazine, poetically gets across a pretty straightforward message: You have to get started early to see better results. And that certainly applies to investing. A lot of savers hesitate to invest because they worry about market volatility or think investing is too complicated. But while saving is important, history has shown that investing is the best way to make your money grow and beat inflation. And it doesn\\'t have to be difficult. In fact, if you have a 401(k), you already have an easy way to get started. Still think it\\'s too hard? Try these five simple steps to investing now so you can look forward to your own future harvests. \"Life on a farm is a school of patience; you can\\'t hurry the crops or make an ox in two days.\" This insight from a French botanist can certainly be applied to investing! While there may be a lot of current attention on fast trading, a long-term view is essential to weathering market ups and downs. Once you set your goals and create a diversified portfolio that matches your timeline and feelings about risk, you need to be patient. As is often stated, it\\'s time in the market—not timing the market—that\\'s the key to success. \"The farmer has to be an optimist or he wouldn’t still be a farmer.\" These words from Will Rogers can apply to many things in life. And certainly being optimistic is as important in investing as in farming. When it comes to finances, you can\\'t absolutely control what will happen any more than a farmer can control the weather—a market drop, a job loss or a pandemic can certainly set you back. But with the right attitude—rooted in a solid financial plan—you\\'ll be able to more easily adjust and continue to make progress toward your goals. So take a lesson from the farmers. Build your fences, stop digging yourself into a hole, plant your seeds (early) and with a little patience and positive thinking, you are setting yourself up to reap the harvest of a more secure financial future.

       "   'content': 'Dividend-paying stocks are an essential part of many investors’ portfolios—though not always for the same reasons. Those with a long-time horizon, for example, often reinvest their dividends as a means of boosting returns. In fact, $10,000 in a hypothetical investment that tracked the S&P 500® Index fund in 1991 would have swelled to more than $211,000 by the end of 2020 had dividends been reinvested, but only to $114,000 had dividends not been reinvested (see “The dividend dividend,” below).

For retirees, on the other hand, the regular payouts from dividend-producing stocks have the potential to provide a steady stream of income. And whereas dividend yields from companies in the S&P 500 may have declined over time, it’s important to consider them in the context of inflation. When inflation is high, it erodes your purchasing power, meaning your dividends must be greater to keep pace with rising prices. The opposite is also true: A low-inflation environment, like the current one, puts less pressure on income. Consequently, you want your dividends to regularly exceed, or at least keep pace with, the rate of inflation—something companies in the S&P 500 has been doing for the better part of five years (see “Preserving purchasing power,” below). Preserving purchasing power Dividends from companies in the S&P 500 may have declined, but they have surpassed inflation since 2012. Source: Robert Shiller and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Data are from 01/01/1979 through 12/31/2020. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not all companies pay dividends, of course. Smaller and less-established companies, which may often provide shareholders with above-average returns, can justify reinvesting in themselves rather than paying out dividends. Larger and more-established companies, by comparison, tend to see slower growth and lower stock returns, and so will typically pay dividends to help retain existing shareholders and attract new ones. Indeed, of the 500 large-cap stocks tracked by the S&P 500, more than four-fifths pay dividends.1 Finding dividend payers When it comes to investing in dividend stocks, many investors turn to mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that offer access to dividend-paying companies across industries. Those who prefer to hold individual stocks might instead want to follow in the footsteps of famed investor Benjamin Graham, who favored companies with three attributes: A history of steady dividend growth: Consistently increasing dividends is generally an indicator of healthy corporate fiscal policy. A low payout ratio: When companies exhibit a low ratio of dividends to earnings, it suggests they’re retaining some earnings, making it less likely they’ll reduce dividends in the future. A respectable current dividend rate: According to research by Robert D. Arnott and Clifford S. Asness, low dividends beget lower stock prices, while high dividends beget higher stock prices.2 However, unusually high dividends can be a sign of corporate distress, so a good rule of thumb is to look for those yielding at least as much as the current 10-year Treasury but no more than twice that amount. Not only may these key characteristics help you identify worthy dividend payers, but companies exhibiting such attributes also tend to be higher quality with lower leverage and debt—which could help your portfolio better weather a downturn. A word of caution That said, no investment vehicle is perfect. Dividend stocks are subject to the same vicissitudes as all other equities. And unlike bonds—whose coupon payments are nearly guaranteed, barring default—their payouts could be trimmed or eliminated altogether without warning. All of which is to say that dividend stocks should not be viewed as a replacement for traditional fixed income investments but rather as a complement to a diversified portfolio. 1Bloomberg®, as of 3/9/2021. 2“Surprise! Higher Dividends = Higher Earnings Growth,” Financial Analysts Journal, 2003.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'A guide for approaching fund allocation in retirement.',\n",
       "   'content': \"According to the Social Security Administration, the average 65-year-old retiree can expect to live roughly 18–20½ years after leaving the workforce.1 However, with advances in health care leading to increasing longevity, it's widely recommended that you plan for a retirement of 30 years or longer. Therefore, how you invest your savings in retirement is crucial. The first aspect of our three-pronged approach to generating retirement income is creating a plan. After you've completed the planning stage, your next step should be to determine your portfolio allocation. Lastly, you'll make a plan for withdrawing from your portfolio in retirement. The portfolio allocation step is all about choosing the right mix of investments. Here's a guide for how to approach it. The key is staying invested--and that means having at least part of your portfolio allocated to stocks, but in the right balance with other investments. 1. Set aside one year of cash Try to set aside enough cash--minus any regular income from rental properties, annuities, pensions, Social Security, investment income etc.--to cover a year's worth of retirement expenses. Ideally, this money would be held in a relatively safe, liquid account, such as an interest-bearing bank account, money market fund or short-term certificate of deposit (CD). With this cash on hand, you won't have to worry as much about the markets or a monthly paycheck. Spend from this account and replenish it periodically with funds from your invested portfolio. Then invest the rest of your portfolio sensibly. 2. Create a short-term reserve Within your main portfolio, starting with accounts that you may need to tap soon, create a short-term reserve to cover withdrawals from your portfolio and help weather a prolonged market downturn--we recommend two to four years' worth of living expenses, again after accounting for other regular income sources, if you can. This short-term reserve will help prevent you from having to sell more volatile investments, like stocks, in a down market. This money can be invested in high-quality, short-term bonds or other fixed income investments, such as short-term bonds or bond funds. Or, if you'd rather manage individual investments, you might want to create a short-term CD or bond ladder--a strategy in which you invest in CDs or bonds with staggered maturity dates so that the proceeds can be collected at regular intervals. When the CDs or bonds mature, you can use the money to replenish your bank account. 3. Invest the rest of your portfolio When it comes to the rest of your portfolio, remember that your overarching goal is to create a mix of investments that work together to preserve capital, generate income and grow. Your specific mix of stock, bond and cash investments should be appropriate for your age, income needs, financial goals, time horizon and comfort with risk. With a year's worth of cash on hand and a short-term reserve in place, invest the remainder of your portfolio in investments that align with your goals and risk tolerance. For example, it's perfectly acceptable to focus on growth in the early years of retirement in order to take advantage of potential compounding to continue to grow savings for expenses later in retirement or a legacy, depending on goals and time horizon. As you move through retirement, you may want to shift to a more conservative investing approach that seeks to preserve capital and generate income. What to do if you have an annuity Many retirees use annuities to provide a steady paycheck that they won't outlive, and to help protect part of their portfolios from market risk. If you have predictable income from any type of annuity, you may be comfortable reducing the balance in your cash account and short-term reserve, as well as investing the rest of your portfolio in stocks and bonds for growth potential. With this in mind, consider lowering the amount you set aside in cash and the short-term reserve by the income, if any, generated from an annuity. The annuity income can be seen as a baseline of income, in addition to Social Security and other sources, before you withdraw from your portfolio. Annuity guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.

Adapt your strategy over time Here's an example of how you might adjust your asset allocation throughout retirement, if you plan to use your portfolio including principal, to support spending, rather than spending only your investment earnings and leaving your nest egg to your heirs. Retirees who adopted this plan would have seen the following results in their portfolios*: Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Morningstar, Inc. *Based on data collected from 1970 through 2020. The return figures represent the best and worst total returns, as well as the compound average annual total returns, for the hypothetical asset allocation plans. The asset allocation plans are weighted averages of the performance of the indexes used to represent each asset class in the plans and are rebalanced annually. Returns include reinvestment of dividends and interest. The indexes representing each asset class are S&P 500® Index (large-cap stocks), Russell 2000® Index (small-cap stocks), MSCI EAFE® Net of Taxes (international stocks), Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (bonds) and FTSE U.S. 3-month Treasury bills (cash investments). The conservative allocation is composed of 15% large-cap stocks, 5% international stocks, 50% bonds and 30% cash investments. The moderately conservative allocation is 25% large-cap stocks, 5% small-cap stocks, 10% international stocks, 50% bonds and 10% cash investments. The moderate allocation is 35% large-cap stocks, 10% small-cap stocks, 15% international stocks, 35% bonds and 5% cash investments. CRSP 6-8 was used for small-cap stocks prior to 1979, and Ibbotson U.S. 30-day Treasury Bill Index was used for cash investments prior to 1978. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The key is staying invested--and that means having at least part of your portfolio allocated to stocks, but in the right balance with other investments. Why? Over time, equities historically have been an adequate defense against inflation and taxes--even better than bonds and cash.2 However, limit your exposure to stocks based on how much you'll need from your portfolio soon, because there will be less time to recover from a bad year in the market. The key is determine the right mix for you, based on your age, needs, and time horizon. 1 Social Security Administration, Actuarial Life Table, 2017.

       "   'content': 'We are often asked if the U.S. dollar will lose its status as the world’s reserve currency. Investors are concerned that the Federal Reserve’s easy monetary policy, combined with rising budget deficits, will undermine confidence in the dollar. The recent drop in the dollar over the past year has heightened these concerns. While we agree that there can be unforeseen consequences from the current policy mix, we believe the dollar’s role as the dominant global currency looks secure. What are reserve currencies? Reserve currencies are typically issued by large, developed countries with records of financial stability. To be held in reserve by a foreign central bank, a currency typically needs to: • be freely convertible (not pegged by the government); • have a large and liquid debt market that foreign investors can access; • have an independent central bank; • and be widely used in trade and global transactions. In addition to the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, British pound, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, and Chinese renminbi are all held in reserve. However, the dollar is by far the most widely held currency at 60% based on 2020 data from the IMF. Foreign exchange holdings as a percentage of total allocated in U.S. dollars Source: Bloomberg. Foreign Exchange Holdings as a Percentage of Total Allocated in U.S. Dollars, Euro, Yen, Renminbi, and Other Reserve Currencies. Currencies represented in “Others”: Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Great British Pound, and unclassified others (CCFRUSD% Index, CCFREUR% Index, CCFRJPY% Index, CCFRCNYP Index, CCFROTR% Index, CCFRCHF% Index, CCFRCADP Index, CCFRAUDP Index, CCFRGBP% Index). Quarterly data as of 12/30/2020. The U.S. dollar is also used in about 40% of global trade and nearly 80% of all global cross-border transactions. Most commodities and many other goods are traded in U.S. dollars—oil, copper, and agricultural goods—to name a few. Investors need to hold dollars to trade in goods and services, and need to have a large and liquid bond market to in which to invest those dollars. Most transactions are made in U.S. dollars Source: Bank of International Settlements (BIS). The BIS Triennial OTC Derivatives Statistics: FX Turnover by currency. Triennial data as of 12/31/2019. What about alternatives? Over the years, the euro’s usage in global transactions has grown, the Japanese yen’s usage has been largely stable, and there has been a slight increase in the renminbi’s role. However, none of these currencies seem likely to supplant the dollar any time soon. The most likely candidate would be the euro, as the euro area represents a large segment of global gross domestic product. However, its bond markets are fragmented across many different countries and are less liquid than the U.S. Treasury bond market, limiting the amount that a foreign investor might be able to hold in euros. China is believed to have ambitions to make its currency the pre-eminent reserve currency, but it has a long way to go. The biggest limitation is that its currency’s value is managed. It isn’t freely convertible to other currencies, so investors can’t be sure whether capital controls could be used to limit access their holdings. So far, it has very limited usage in global transactions, representing just 3% of global transactions relative to about 80% for the dollar. Reserve currencies rise and fall in value While we believe the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency will remain intact for the foreseeable future, its value will rise and fall with changes in the economic fundamentals. Since its peak in March 2020, the dollar has dropped by about 11%. The decline reflects the Federal Reserve’s expansive monetary policy when the COVID-19 crisis hit. The Fed lowered short-term interest rates and increased the supply of dollars available to foreign central banks to help ease financial conditions during the crisis. However, we don’t see a concerted effort by the central bank to undermine the dollar’s value. In fact, a weaker dollar is generally seen as a positive for global growth because it eases financing conditions for borrowers—especially in emerging-market countries. Finally, the dollar remains a safe-haven asset. During times of global stress, the dollar generally moves up as investors seek a large, liquid, and reliable place to put their money. When the pandemic struck in early 2020, the dollar soared to its highest level in decades compared to a wide range of other currencies due to global demand. The U.S. dollar has dropped from its highs Source: Bloomberg. Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index (BBDXY Index). Daily data as of 3/8/2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Having the world’s reserve currency affords the U.S. some privileges. It means there is underlying demand for U.S. bonds from foreign central banks and other large investors looking for a safe market in which to invest. That allows the U.S. to borrow at lower rates than would otherwise be possible. Many years ago, former French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing used the phrase “exorbitant privilege” to describe the benefits accruing to the U.S. from having the world’s reserve currency. It’s still the case today.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'A second home is a substantial investment that lives by different rules than your primary residence. Here’s what you need to consider.',\n",
       "   'content': 'In the market for a second home? You\\'re not alone. Low interest rates and the COVID-19 pandemic have sparked a buying boom in second homes—whether to serve as a personal getaway or to generate rental income—according to data from the National Association of Realtors.1 However you utilize a second home, it\\'s a substantial investment—one that\\'s subject to different rules than your primary residence. \"Whether or not you\\'re using it for rental income, a second home comes with its own set of financial considerations,\" says Hayden Adams, CPA and director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Here, then, are the factors to consider when buying, renting, and selling a second home. Buying Once you\\'ve found the right home for your needs, it\\'s time to figure out how to pay for it. \"Paying in cash is one option, though in a low-interest-rate environment that money might be put to better use in the market,\" says Ken Szymanski, a managing director at Charles Schwab Banking & Trust Services. If instead you decide to borrow to fund your second home or investment property, there are several financing options open to you, including: A traditional mortgage: The most popular types include fixed-rate loans—typically for 15 or 30 years (generally speaking, the shorter the loan, the lower the interest rate)—and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), whose interest rates reset after a fixed period of time and adjust in response to prevailing market rates. Jumbo loans—or those that exceed $548,250 in most counties in the United States—may require heftier down payments and have higher interest rates, closing costs, and fees. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, you can deduct the interest on up to $750,000 worth of such loans (married couples who file separately can deduct up to $375,000 each). Note that for homes bought before Dec. 16, 2017, you can apply the higher limit of $1 million (or $500,000 for married couples filing separately) for interest deductions. A home equity line of credit (HELOC): A HELOC allows you to borrow against the equity in your existing residence—and the interest may be deductible if the funds are used to purchase, build, or substantially renovate a primary or secondary residence, up to the limits mentioned previously. A cash-out refinance: This refi approach replaces your existing mortgage with one that carries a larger balance. The difference between the two loans is distributed as cash, which can be especially useful if you have house-related expenses over and above the new property\\'s purchase price. Securities-based lending: A non-purpose* line of credit from a bank can allow you to borrow against the value of your non-retirement assets while helping to keep your investment strategy on track (see \"Another way to borrow,\" below). However you choose to finance your purchase, do your homework to understand the considerations and risks involved in obtaining a second home. Chief among them: Additional debt: Taking on new debt could impact your cash flow and savings plan. Bigger down payment: Lenders may require a larger down payment on a second home, in which case you\\'ll need to consider how to come up with the money without putting your other investments at risk. Finally, be realistic about expenses. Beyond the purchase price, there are an array of ongoing costs, including repairs, utilities, and possibly homeowners\\' association fees. A good starting point is to calculate what you\\'re paying monthly for the upkeep on your current residence and assume a similar outlay for your second home. Also, note that many popular vacation spots, particularly in coastal communities, are at increased risk of flooding, wildfires, and other weather-related events, so make sure you\\'re adequately insured and at a price that makes sense. Renting You also need to decide up front whether you\\'ll rent out your second home, be it occasionally or on an ongoing basis. A rental property can provide not only income but also potential tax benefits. For example, you may be able to deduct certain expenses, such as depreciation, from your annual rental income. Keep in mind, however, that you\\'ll likely face a host of tax obligations as well. Apart from property taxes, any rental income could potentially push you into a higher tax bracket. Also, if you use a second home as both a rental property and for extended personal use, you may not be eligible for all the deductions a rental property alone would provide. A tax advisor can help you maximize the available deductions while helping you fulfill your tax obligations. \"Some people think of a rental property as a hobby, but it\\'s not—it’s a business,\" Hayden says. \"That’s certainly how the IRS sees it, and that\\'s how you should see it, too.\" Another question to tackle in advance: How will you interact with renters? Some owners take a hands-on approach to everything from collecting rent to making repairs, while others hire handymen and even full-service property managers who can find suitable renters, help refurbish the property between tenants, and do everything in between. Such white-glove service comes at a cost, but it can be especially helpful with a property in a distant locale. Also be sure to check with a real estate agent and/or your homeowners\\' association regarding local rental rules. These can vary by municipality and even by neighborhood and are evolving rapidly in response to the rise of vacation rentals through companies such as Airbnb. In New York City, for example, you cannot rent out an entire apartment or home to visitors for fewer than 30 days, even if you own or live in the building. Owners should also strongly consider setting aside emergency funds to avoid selling securities in a down market to pay for any unexpected expenses. Finally, Hayden urges those planning to rent out a second home to treat it as a separate business entity. \"If your rental isn\\'t structured properly, any renter who brings a lawsuit could potentially take your car, house, or hard-earned savings,\" he says. For example, registering a business as a limited liability company (LLC) can help protect your assets in the event you\\'re sued—as can liability insurance. Selling Once it comes time to sell a property, it\\'s a good idea to meet with a tax professional first. In particular, many owners are surprised to learn that any depreciation in the value of a rental property claimed for tax purposes reduces that property\\'s cost basis. If the property is later sold for a profit, the seller will generally owe a 25% tax on any previously claimed depreciation before being subject to potential capital gains taxes. What\\'s more, if the property has not been your primary residence for at least two of the past five years, you may not qualify for the capital gains exclusion, which allows you to shield the first $500,000 in profit from capital gains taxes if you\\'re married and file jointly ($250,000 if you\\'re a single filer). The rules surrounding the capital gains exclusion can be complex, so it\\'s best to check with an accountant before attempting to claim this exclusion for rental properties, in particular. Another potential option to discuss with a tax advisor is a 1031 like-kind exchange, which allows you to roll the proceeds from one rental property directly into another, thereby deferring any capital gains taxes until the second property is sold. A 1031 like-kind exchange can be done multiple times, potentially deferring for many years the taxation of any capital gains. \"A team effort\" Buying a second home involves a lot of work, not only in advance of buying but throughout the rental process and eventual sale. Finding a reliable team of professionals—an accountant, an attorney, a real estate agent, and possibly a property manager—can help. \"More so even than your primary residence, successful second-home ownership is a team effort,\" says Hayden. And of course an experienced financial advisor or wealth strategist can help you to realize your dream of second-home ownership to begin with. Another way to borrow Leveraging the value of your assets rather than liquidating them can be a smart strategy. If you need access to capital but are hesitant to liquidate part of your portfolio because of concerns about selling when it\\'s not convenient, tax consequences, or other considerations, it might make sense to borrow against your assets to fund your goal.

       "   'abstract': 'Behavioral economist Richard Thaler shares his advice for a secure financial future.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, I\\'ve been promoting the tried-and-true principles of smart money management for so many years, it can be hard to come up with fresh ways to share their important message. Spend less, save more and diversify your portfolio as you invest for your long-term goals. As old-fashioned as this advice may sound, it remains the foundation for your future financial success. But if you still need convincing, I invite you to listen to the wisdom of prominent behavioral economist and Nobel Laureate Richard Thaler. One of my colleagues had the opportunity to sit down with Professor Thaler early this year and asked him the following question: \"As individuals, what lessons can we take from 2020 as we strive to build a strong future?\" We all need an emergency fund Professor Thaler\\'s advice was two-fold. First, if you were lucky enough to reduce your spending over the course of the last several months and now have extra cash, this is a unique opportunity to build a financial cushion. Take enough of that money to cover a minimum of three-to-six months\\' worth of your essential expenses, and stash it in a safe and liquid account. It won\\'t earn much, but you can be confident it will be there when you need it. Don\\'t be blinded by the stock market stars If you\\'re one of the millions of people who jumped into the stock market for the first time last year, Richard Thaler has a word of caution: Beware of false confidence. For months on end in 2020, several leading tech companies in particular were burning bright. But these shooting stars may soon flame out. Making money on Zoom, Amazon or Tesla in 2020 made investing seem deceptively easy and seductive. To quote Professor Thaler, \"If you were a new investor who started in May, you may think you\\'re a genius. It is very hard to distinguish between luck and skill.\" This is a crucial distinction. As I\\'ve pointed out in a recent column, investing is serious business that requires time, knowledge and discipline. Slick trading platforms can resemble video games, eliciting the same rapid-fire moves. But as Professor Thaler points out, \"if you want to entertain yourself, don\\'t play with stocks, go find a poker game.\" That get-rich-quick mentality is the complete opposite of the mindset you need to be a successful long-term investor. Spread out your risk with funds At the core of this advice are the crucial principles of asset allocation and diversification. By spreading out your money not only between different companies, but also between different types of companies and categories of investments, you decrease your risk and increase your odds for long-term success. What does this mean for individual investors? According to Thaler, the message is clear: Stick with mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. He notes that last year saw an alarming increase in the number of amateur investors buying shares of individual companies. Yes, the high-flying companies are alluring, but the reality is that they can fade as quickly and easily as they can soar. At some point, many may come back to earth. Backing up just a little, it\\'s important to set realistic goals and have a plan whenever you invest. Only after you\\'ve built a solid foundation of broad-based funds should you even think about adding a few individual securities—and then only if you have the skill and time that it takes to research a company\\'s financials, management team and strategies. It\\'s not impossible to do well by buying and selling individual securities—and it can be fun. But it\\'s far more likely that rapid trading–especially in \\'meme stocks\\'–will wind up being hazardous to your long-term wealth. It\\'s a rather bold assertion to think you know something that millions of other investors including institutional and professional money managers haven\\'t already priced in. Make what\\'s good for you easy, and what\\'s bad for you hard Part of the brilliance of Professor Thaler\\'s work in behavioral economics is the understanding that you can’t fight human nature. We don\\'t always, or even mostly, behave in a rational way. So given that, it makes more sense to work with our nature rather than work against it. I think of this in terms of making the things that are good for you easy, and the things that aren\\'t good for you hard. It’s not unlike how you might approach a diet. You purge your kitchen of candy and other sweets, and you stock the fridge with veggies and fruit. When it comes to investing, you can think of funds as your fruit: healthy and easy to access. You can then apply the same principle by setting up automatic deposits from your paycheck to your 401(k). This not only takes the day-to-day decision-making out of your hands, but it\\'s also your ticket to a strategy known as dollar-cost averaging that will help you navigate the stock market year in and year out, through market surges like the one we experienced recently, but also through market declines. This is because as risky as it can be to pour a huge amount of money into the stock market at any particular moment, it\\'s equally dangerous to pull it out and find yourself on the sidelines for the next upswing. Multiple studies have shown that \\'market timing\\'—or the attempt to get in and out of the market at exactly the right time—is extremely difficult to achieve. And if professional money managers can’t do it with any consistency, you won’t be able to either. Successful investors often continue to invest through good times and bad, and automatic deposits can help you do just that. A path to a brighter future When you think about how complicated the financial world has become, it\\'s easy to feel overwhelmed. Every time you turn around, you have to make another choice—between banks, brokerage houses, insurance companies and investments. So my strong advice is to simplify. As Richard Thaler recommends, stick to the fundamentals. Use that money you didn\\'t spend in 2020 to build up your emergency reserves. Use mutual funds and exchange-traded funds to diversify your investments. Keep yourself on the right path by putting your contributions on auto-pilot. The road to a brighter future doesn’t have to be complicated. It just requires having the confidence to set yourself up to succeed. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'With attractive yields, dividend-paying stocks could potentially pump up total returns from your stock portfolio and generate extra income.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Today’s low interest rates—plus the prospect of below-average stock returns over the coming decade—are a one-two punch for both income-focused investors and savers struggling to regain lost ground in the wake of an uneven recovery. However, whether you’re looking to generate extra income or to potentially pump up total returns from your stock portfolio, dividend-paying stocks are uniquely suited to help soften the blow. Here’s what to know about dividend stocks, and how to pick the best ones for you. The perks (and pitfalls) of dividend payers Dividend payers tend to be big, well-established companies that have an abundance of cash. “They often can’t compete with the rapid appreciation of fledgling, fast-growing companies, so they use dividend payouts as an enticement,” says Steve Greiner, vice president of Schwab Equity Ratings®. Dividends, when reinvested, can significantly boost total returns over time, making dividend-paying stocks an attractive option for older and younger investors alike. For example, if you invested $1,000 in a hypothetical investment that tracked the S&P 500® Index on January 1, 1990, but didn’t reinvest the dividends, your investment would have been worth $8,982 at the end of 2019. If you had reinvested the dividends, you would have ended up with $16,971—nearly twice as much (see “More bang for your buck,” below). More bang for your buck Reinvesting dividends could significantly boost total returns over time. Source: Charles Schwab. Data from 01/01/1990 through 12/31/2020. Calculations assume a starting portfolio value of $1,000. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs, and expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. With the S&P 500 yielding 1.52% as of December 31, 2020, dividends could also prove an attractive alternative to Treasuries and other fixed income investments in the coming years. “Of course, dividend-paying stocks are generally much riskier than bonds, something income investors in particular should consider when weighing their options,” Steve says. What’s more, dividends aren’t guaranteed, unlike, say, the interest payments from Treasuries. Companies can trim or slash their dividends at any time, a risk that was realized in 2020 after 68 of the roughly 380 dividend-paying companies in the S&P 500 suspended or reduced their payouts. “Fortunately, companies generally only cut dividends when they’re in distress,” Steve says, “so favoring those with sound financial metrics can help mitigate this risk.” How to pick dividend stocks These six tips can help you identify dividend-paying stocks with strong financial health: 1. Don’t chase high dividend yields: “There’s a reason—and not always a good one—that a security is offering payouts that are well above its peers or the broader market,” Steve says. “Before jumping at a big yield, try to determine why it’s so high.” Dividend yield is calculated by dividing a stock’s total annual dividend payouts by its current share price. If a high or rising yield is due to a shrinking share price, that’s a bad sign and could indicate that a dividend cut is on the horizon. If a rising dividend yield is due to rising profits, on the other hand, that’s a much more auspicious sign. “When net profits rise, dividends tend to follow suit, so just be sure you know what’s causing the increase before buying the stock,” he says. 2. Assess the payout ratio: This metric—which is calculated by dividing dividends per share by earnings per share—tells you how much of a company’s earnings are going toward the dividend. “A ratio higher than 100% means the company is paying out more to its shareholders than it’s earning,” Steve says. “In such cases, it may be able to cover its dividends from available cash, but that can last only so long.” If a company whose stock you own is losing money but still paying a dividend, it may be time to sell. “Dividend payers in financial straits may try to stave off a dividend cut—which can drive away shareholders—by funding payouts with borrowed funds or dwindling cash reserves,” Steve says. “It’s rare that such measures turn things around, though. They’re usually just delaying the inevitable.” 3. Check the balance sheet: High levels of debt represent a competing use of cash. “If push comes to shove,” Steve says, “the company is going to pay its creditors before it pays its dividends.” A good rule of thumb is to favor companies with a “current ratio”—a measure of the company’s current assets versus its current liabilities—of 2 or higher, which is a good indicator of its ability to cover its short-term obligations. 4. Look at dividend growth: Generally speaking, you want to find companies that not only pay steady dividends but also increase them at regular intervals—say, once per year over the past three, five, or even 10 years. Indeed, companies that grow their dividends tend to outperform their peers over time (see “Supersize me,” below). Supersize me Over the past 40 years, stocks that maintained or grew their dividends outperformed those that cut their payouts or offered none at all.

Not only that, but “a strong history of regular dividend growth also helps keep pace with inflation—which is particularly valuable to income-seeking investors,” Steve says. Nevertheless, you probably should give companies a break if they didn’t increase dividends in 2020, or if they don’t in 2021. “Most have been hoarding cash to help weather the economic uncertainty, so it’s not unreasonable for them to keep dividends flat until the economy bounces back,” Steve says. 5. Understand sector risk: Some sectors offer a more attractive combination of dividends and growth than others—but they also offer different risk characteristics that you should consider when researching dividend payers for your portfolio. Stocks from the banking, consumer staples, and utilities sectors, for example, are known for steady dividends and lower volatility, but they also tend to offer less growth potential. Dividend-paying tech companies, on the other hand, could offer attractive dividends along with the opportunity for larger price gains, but they also tend to be much more volatile. “If you’re a long-term investor, you might be willing to accept tech’s higher volatility in exchange for its growth and income prospects,” Steve says. “But if you’re nearing or in retirement, you might want to stick with dividend payers from less-volatile industries.” 6. Consider a fund: If you’re worried about the potential for price declines eroding the value of your dividend stocks, consider instead a dividend-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) or mutual fund. Such funds typically hold stocks that have a history of distributing dividends to their shareholders, and they can provide a greater level of diversification than you can achieve by buying a handful of dividend-paying stocks. Do your homework No matter what stage of life you’re in, dividend-paying stocks can be a great way to supplement your income and improve your portfolio’s growth potential. Just be sure you research the companies’ overall financial health, not just their dividend rates, before investing. When not to reinvest Three situations in which you might want to deploy dividend payouts elsewhere. You’re in or near retirement: When you’re living off your savings, taking income from your dividends allows you to let more of your portfolio stay invested for growth. If you’re nearing retirement, on the other hand, you can use the payouts to build up your cash and short-term reserves as you prepare for the transition to life after work. Your portfolio is out of balance: Reinvesting the dividends of a well-performing investment back into that investment can throw your portfolio off balance over time. In such cases, you might want to take the cash and reinvest it elsewhere. The investment is underperforming: If you’re worried about an investment’s future prospects but aren’t quite ready to let it go, you may not want to reinvest the payouts back into that investment. Instead, you might use the dividends to dip your toe into prospective investments that could ultimately replace the underperforming investment.

       "   'abstract': 'What to know before using your assets as collateral.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Debt often gets a bad rap. But when managed responsibly, it can help you achieve your financial goals. In fact, the more assets you have, the more lending solutions you may have at your disposal. \"Clients who have built up their net worth—whether in their homes or investment portfolios—could have broader borrowing options by using their own assets as collateral,\" says Chris Kawashima, a senior research analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"But doing so exposes those assets to increased risk, so you’ve got to have the fortitude and investment knowledge to manage such debt effectively.\" Let\\'s take a look at three asset-backed lending solutions—and under what circumstances they might be most appropriate. 1. Home-equity line of credit What it is: A home equity line of credit (HELOC) allows you to borrow against the equity in your home. As with a credit card, you draw from and repay an available line of credit, usually at variable interest rates. Unlike credit cards, HELOCs typically have a fixed draw period (often five to 10 years), after which time the line of credit is closed and any remaining balance must be paid back, with interest, before the repayment period ends (often 10 to 20 years). When to use it: Although you can use a HELOC for many purposes, it\\'s particularly well-suited to: Home improvements: If you itemize your deductions, the IRS may allow you to deduct interest paid if the funds are used to \"buy, build, or substantially improve your home.\" That can make HELOCs an attractive option for financing home improvements. Liquidity: Even if you don\\'t have an immediate cash need, establishing a HELOC can be a great way to back up your emergency fund or short-term savings. For example, if you need cash during a market selloff and want to avoid tapping your cash reserves or selling securities at a loss, drawing on a HELOC could offer an alternative source of funds. \"Should the markets bounce back, you can replenish what you borrowed,\" Chris says. \"In that way, the loan can act as a nice little safety net.\" Debt consolidation: Interest rates on HELOCs often are much lower than those charged by credit cards and personal loans, making them a potentially attractive option for consolidating debt and reducing borrowing costs. Because a HELOC is secured by your property, however, Chris says you should have a solid payoff strategy before you consolidate higher-interest-rate debt, since you could be putting your home on the line if you can’t pay it back. P.S. Lenders need time to process a HELOC application because it requires a home appraisal and a review of both your credit and financial histories, which can take weeks. \"Because of the time involved, it’s best to open a HELOC well before you need the funds,\" Chris says. 2. Margin What it is: Just as a bank can lend you money against the equity in your home, your brokerage firm can lend you money against the value of eligible stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds in your portfolio. Margin loans typically require a minimum of $2,000 in cash or marginable securities and generally are limited to 50% of the investments\\' value. Interest rates vary depending on the amount being borrowed but tend to be lower than unsecured lending options such as credit cards. When to use it: Funds borrowed on margin are usually used for: Additional investments: Active traders may establish a margin account as a way to take advantage of a trading opportunity when they don\\'t have adequate cash on hand. If you use the funds to purchase investments that generate taxable income—including interest, nonqualified dividends, and short-term capital gains—you may be able to deduct the interest paid if you itemize your deductions. However, if the value of your margin account falls below the maintenance requirement—the minimum dollar amount that you must maintain in the margin account once you’ve tapped the funds—your brokerage will issue a maintenance call, which requires you to either deposit more money or marginable securities, or sell some of the assets held in your account. Short-term liquidity needs: As with any line of credit, you can draw from and replenish a margin account for any reason, not just purchasing securities. \"A margin loan is a ready source of credit that may be used as a short-term loan for any need—and unlike a HELOC, there\\'s no lengthy application process,\" Chris says. \"But I can’t stress enough the importance of moderating your borrowing. If you borrow too much and your portfolio\\'s value declines before you repay the money, you could face a hefty maintenance call—or a large tax bill if appreciated securities are sold to meet the maintenance requirement.\" P.S. It\\'s important that the assets in your account are diversified. If you\\'re overly concentrated in a particular investment, you could quickly find yourself below the required maintenance threshold if that investment declines considerably. 3. Securities-based lines of credit What it is: Like margin, a securities-based line of credit offered through a bank allows you to borrow against the value of your portfolio, usually at variable interest rates. Assets are pledged as collateral and held in a separate brokerage account at a broker-dealer. Unlike margin, these nonpurpose credit lines may not be used to purchase securities or pay down margin loans, nor can the funds be deposited into any brokerage account. Such lines of credit also tend to require more borrowing than a margin account (Schwab Bank’s Pledged Asset Line®, for example, has a minimum line size of $100,000 and an initial minimum advance of $70,000). When to use it: Because of the large initial advance requirement that may apply, a securities-based line of credit is best for: Bridge financing: \"We typically see a securities-based line of credit used for something that would otherwise be a short-term loan,\" Chris says. \"For example, clients who wish to buy a new home before they’ve sold their current one have found that this type of credit line can provide a useful bridge between the two transactions.\" Liquidity: When you need quick access to cash but don\\'t want to sell your investments—which can trigger capital gains taxes and upend your investment strategy—a securities-based line of credit could be a solution. \"Because of the high initial advance requirement, it\\'s best to establish this type of credit line when you have an immediate cash need, such as a significant tax bill,\" Chris says. \"Once you take the initial advance, however, you can use the credit line for smaller liquidity needs going forward.\" P.S. A securities-based line of credit from a bank is subject to a high degree of risk, which you should be sure you understand before applying. Should the market value of the pledged collateral decrease, the bank may demand immediate repayment of outstanding obligations or require you to deposit additional cash or securities to the pledged brokerage account in order to avoid the sale of pledged assets. Pledging diversified assets can help reduce this risk. Be that as it may, you should keep an eye on the value of your pledged assets—and have a backup source of funds in the event of a demand. Have an endgame Margin and bank-offered securities-based lines of credit, in particular, are best suited for those savvy about the markets. \"You need to know how much risk you\\'re taking on—and be vigilant about managing that risk,\" Chris says. What’s more, \"it’s crucial to develop a repayment strategy, because unlike, say, a traditional mortgage, asset-backed loans generally have a more flexible repayment schedule,\" Chris adds. \"And whatever you do, always pay more than just the interest due each month.\" Asset-backed borrowing at a glance Asset-backed borrowing at a glance Home equity line of credit Margin loan Bank-issued securities-based line of credit Assets used as collateral > Home equity line of credit Real estate, including your primary residence and second home > Margin loan Eligible securities in most nonretirement accounts > Bank-issued securities-based line of credit Eligible securities, as determined by the bank, held in a separate pledged brokerage account > Minimum collateral requirement > Home equity line of credit Established by the lender and typically based on the requested line amount and the associated home value > Margin loan Typically $2,000; some brokers may require more > Bank-issued securities-based line of credit Varies; many lenders, including Schwab Bank, require a $100,000 or more minimum loan value of collateral > Borrowing limits > Home equity line of credit Varies by lender.

       "   'abstract': '2020 Ariel-Schwab Black Investor Survey results give insight into financial inequalities—plus a signal of hope.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, In the last 15 years writing Ask Carrie columns, I\\'ve often written about why and how investing opens the door to financial freedom. In my mind, the advice—and the opportunity—should be available to everyone. Unfortunately, for too many Black Americans that\\'s not the case. As a country, we\\'ve started to have some important conversations that are long overdue. Racial inequality and the resulting wealth gap are not only disastrous for the impacted individuals, but also weaken our communities and our economy. To begin to address these issues, I\\'d like to share some insights from the 2020 Black Investor Survey that Schwab conducted in collaboration with Ariel Investments, the oldest minority-owned investment firm established in the United States. This long-running survey looked at stock market participation as well as the characteristics and attitudes of middle-class Black and white investors. But despite having similar income levels, the survey revealed some stark disparities—as well as some encouraging trends. Historic low participation in the stock market persists among Black Americans…which exacerbates wealth inequality First, we need to appreciate that far fewer Black than white Americans invest in the stock market. This has historically been the case, but the 2020 Ariel-Schwab Survey showed the largest gap in the study\\'s 20-year history (55 percent of Black versus 71 percent of white Americans). The reasons for this are complex and include decades of systematic discrimination, less money available to save and invest, and lack of trust. But the impact is crystal clear: without the power of the stock market on one\\'s side, the wealth gap continues to widen. As the stock market hits record highs, those who don\\'t invest are left further behind. To provide context, despite the major stock market collapse of 2000, the Great Recession in 2008 and the pandemic declines in 2020, $1 invested in the S&P 500 in 2000 would be worth almost four times that amount today. In contrast, a dollar placed in savings would have lost value when compared to inflation. And while you don\\'t need a lot of money to start investing, you do need time to build assets that can compound into significant wealth. The financial services industry needs a bigger and better welcome mat One of the most troubling and telling statistics in our survey is that the majority of Black investors (65 percent) as opposed to white investors (38 percent) don\\'t feel respected by financial institutions and so don\\'t trust them. Black investors who work with a financial advisor express greater trust, but this is a clear call to action for every bank, brokerage house and insurance company—including Schwab. Without the foundation of respect, we can’t expect anyone to entrust us with their hard-earned dollars. My friend Michelle Singletary put a very human face on this issue in her column \"A Legacy of Slavery Made My Grandmother Fear Investing.\" Generations of oppression and discriminatory policies legitimately overshadowed every financial decision Michelle\\'s grandmother made. Michelle writes \"As a descendent of slaves who were denied the right to own anything of real value\" the only investment that her grandmother trusted was her home. Her experience taught her that she needed to \"see and touch her wealth.\" For this smart and determined woman, stocks and other financial instruments were simply out of the question. To me, the message is clear: it\\'s up to those of us who work in finance to earn the respect and trust of Black investors, not the other way around. Schwab was founded on the principle of democratizing investing. Now, as an industry, we need to examine every aspect of the way we do business to unequivocally expand our outreach to underrepresented individuals and communities of color. We must do better to level the playing field for all Americans. Signs of hope: Young Black investors are closing the gap On the positive side, the tide seems to be turning for younger Black Americans. In our survey, 63 percent of Black investors under age 40 were participating in the stock market, a number equivalent to their white counterparts. In fact, in this younger age group, three times as many Black investors as white investors invested in the stock market for the first time in 2020. The importance of financial literacy and dinner table conversations Another necessary step to eliminating the wealth and investing gap lies in financial literacy—whether that takes place in the home, in schools or in the workplace. Investing isn\\'t intuitive. It’s a learned skill that requires knowledge, practice and discipline. A bright spot in our survey is that dinner table conversations about money and investing are on the upswing, especially among young Black investors. As Mellody Hobson, Co-CEO and President of Ariel Investments, points out: \"Not only are Black Americans beginning to walk the walk, we are also beginning to talk the talk. In fact, Black Americans are much more likely to discuss the stock market with their families than in years past.\" Another interesting trend is a new sense of optimism among Black investors. When asked to predict their financial condition in 2021 compared to 2020, 60 percent of Black investors felt that their situation would improve; only 40 percent of white investors echoed this sentiment. Building a brighter future for all As America begins to recover from the ravages of 2020, we have the opportunity to build a more equitable society for all Americans—on many levels. And while the pandemic, access to health care, policing practices and unemployment have been in the majority of the headlines, we need to pay attention to the ways in which inequality is exacerbated by distrust and lack of participation in the financial markets. As someone who has spent her entire career advocating for financial literacy and underrepresented communities, I vow to do my part in welcoming and helping all Americans build wealth, increase their confidence, and create better lives through planning, saving and investing.

       "   'abstract': 'Take this eight-question behavioral-finance quiz to heighten your awareness of the biases that may be costing you money.',\n",
       "   'content': \"The human brain is not a rational economic actor. When faced with uncertainty, even the best investing minds may throw good money after bad, sell at the first sign of trouble or make all manner of muddled financial decisions. These flaws in our everyday decision-making, first chronicled in the 1970s by Israeli psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, gave rise to the field known as behavioral economics, which aims to mitigate the effects of these embarrassing foibles by heightening our awareness of them. Take this eight-question quiz to find out how clearheaded you are when it comes to financial decision-making. Then read on to check your answers and learn more about some of the most common—and costly—pitfalls. 1. You buy stock in XYZ Corp. and, after several lackluster earnings reports, find it's down 25% from what you paid for it. Which is the best course of action? A. Reassess the stock as though it were a prospective investment B. Hold on to the stock until it gets back to at least the price you paid 2. A year after buying two particularly promising stocks, one has surged while the other has slumped. How do you rate your performance? A. You congratulate yourself on your stock-picking acumen B. You acknowledge you're only one for two 3. Your investment advisor suggests a number of new stocks to replace several long-held, albeit underperforming, investments. How should you react? A. You hold on to the old stocks because they've long been a trusted part of your portfolio B. You listen to your advisor's reasoning and consider the new stocks over the old 4. You inherit $100,000 in cash. What's your next step? A. You hold the inheritance in cash while you evaluate and reevaluate possible investments B. You invest the money according to the asset allocation in your existing retirement plan 5. After the recent stock market correction, you review your investment plan. Which is the best course of action? A. Maintain your current allocation because your long-term goals remain unchanged B. Majorly reduce your exposure to equities in an effort to insulate your portfolio against future shocks 6. Your portfolio gains 10% for two consecutive years, before losing half of those profits in year three. How do you react to the ups and downs? A. You don't fret the loss and remind yourself that your portfolio is still up overall B. You're upset and put your money in cash to help minimize future losses 7. Although U.S. technology stocks have helped your portfolio achieve double-digit annual growth, your financial advisor now believes the sector to be overvalued. What do you do? A. You explore other industries with an eye toward diversification B. You downplay your advisor's concerns and redouble your research on technology trends 8. You see a TV interviewer praising a CEO for several new products her company has developed. Should you buy the stock based on the segment? A. Yes, because of potentially market-moving news from a trusted source B. No, because multiple factors determine a stock's performance The answers—and why they matter 1. Answer: A | Reexamining the investment is the right move. However, many investors will instead hold a stock until it reaches a value they have in their head (the price they paid for it, say, or a previous high)—a behavioral bias known as anchoring. Getting wed to a number can weigh down your judgment, even when the price you're anchored to is irrelevant to the decision at hand. In one seminal study, Kahneman and Tversky spun a wheel containing the numbers 0 through 100 and then asked their research subjects what percentage of the United Nations is made up of African countries. When the wheel landed on 10, the average estimate was 25%, whereas when the number landed on 65, the average estimate was 45%. The numbers on the wheel had absolutely nothing to do with the question at hand, but they influenced the research subjects' estimates nonetheless. 2. Answer: B | An honest assessment reveals your track record to be a lackluster 50/50. However, many investors will instead recall how they knew the surging stock was going to be a winner all along, while conveniently forgetting they were equally hopeful about the second stock—a failure of logic known as hindsight bias. Indeed, people consistently misremember the odds they assigned to an outcome once that outcome is known. In one landmark study, researchers surveyed groups of university students prior to former President Richard Nixon's breakthrough trip to China in 1972 about the probability of certain events taking place, such as a face-to-face meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong. Surveyed again after the trip, the students often misremembered their predictions in light of what actually transpired—invariably giving themselves higher marks than were warranted. 3. Answer: B | In theory, every position must continually earn its place in your portfolio, but in practice, we often overvalue things simply because we already own them—a mental miscue called the endowment effect. One way to counter the endowment effect is to ask yourself whether the reason you bought a particular investment is still valid. It's possible there's a more appropriate investment for you—provided you're willing to let go of what you already own. 4. Answer: B | Putting your $100,000 windfall to work in the market may be the right choice, since cash tends to underperform the stock market over the long haul, even when it's invested at the market's peak. However, many investors suffer from analysis paralysis, or choice overload, which can cause them to sit on the sidelines rather than get in the game. Indeed, a 2000 study found shoppers were 1½ times more likely to visit a display showcasing a large number of jams—but 10 times more likely to make a purchase from one with a more-limited selection. 5. Answer: A | When it comes to financial decisions, long-term trends are historically more reliable than near-term events. After all, it took only 19 trading days after the events of September 11 for the market to return to pre-9/11 levels. Be that as it may, investors often forget this fact because of recency bias, or our predisposition to give added weight to events that have occurred recently. If a market's been going up, for example, we tend to assume continued gains are therefore more likely, whereas a recent correction can lead us to believe another is right behind it. 6. Answer: A | You should feel as much pain from a 10% loss as you do pleasure from a 10% gain, but researchers have concluded the pain of loss is roughly twice as powerful, psychologically speaking, as the pleasure from an equivalent gain—a phenomenon known as loss aversion. As with many behavioral biases, the roots of such thinking are often attributed to the early days of human existence, when the loss of a day's worth of food could spell disaster, whereas an extra day's worth of food might add little to your odds of survival. 7. Answer: A | Our decision-making is subject to confirmation bias—the unconscious tendency to gravitate toward evidence that supports what we already believe. In other words, if you're already heavily invested in technology stocks, it may be time to challenge your predisposition, not confirm it. Confirmation bias is among the more pernicious of our behavioral tics, evident in everything from political polarization to overconcentration in a particular asset class. 8. Answer: B | Company fundamentals are a more reliable barometer of a stock's potential performance than the 24/7 news cycle. Unfortunately, humans more often judge probabilities based on how easily corroborating information comes to mind—a tendency known as availability bias. In this particular case, a compelling TV appearance by a CEO risks crowding out other information that perhaps has a greater bearing on the company's stock. In fact, availability bias is one reason people believe they're much more likely to win the lottery than they actually are, as those who hit the jackpot are heavily promoted while the multitudes who come up empty go unmentioned. Blocking behavioral biases Awareness is only half the battle. To truly overcome these mental miscues, consider adopting a more objective approach to your investments by: Relying on fundamentals: Clients can evaluate a prospective investment against other opportunities—and even current holdings—using Schwab's comparison tools. Reviewing your performance: Keep records of your trades—including your rationale for purchasing each investment—and evaluate them from time to time. If an investment is underperforming its benchmark or is no longer appropriate to your strategy, it may be time to dump it—even if that means taking a loss. Working with an advisor: Seek out a second opinion, especially when considering big changes to your portfolio or strategy. Unbiased, professional insights can help you reexamine your assumptions and eschew emotional decision making. Awareness is only half the battle.

       "   'content': 'Using a market order is one way for a trader to gain better control of their order. Understanding what order types are, why and when traders use them, and what factors impact their execution can help you match an order type to your specific trade objectives. Market order A market order, the most basic and common order type, is an order to either sell a security at the next available bid price or buy a security at the next available ask price. Note that the last trade price has no influence on a market orde\\'s execution. The next available bid or ask, once the order reaches its turn for execution, determines the fill price of a market order. While a market order generally assures an execution under normal market conditions, it does not guarantee a specified price. When to use market orders Market orders are day orders, meaning that they remain valid only for the standard trading session in which they were entered (between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. ET). Traders cannot use market orders to execute orders during extended-hours sessions, such as pre-market or after-hours sessions. Orders placed outside of the standard market session will be considered for execution at the opening of the next market. Market order advantages Market orders are optimal when the primary goal is to execute the trade immediately. A market order is generally appropriate when you think a stock is priced right, when you are sure you want a fill on your order, or when you want an immediate execution. Traders should consider using market orders when the need to enter or exit a trade outweighs the desire to control the execution price. Market order risks Market closure – The timing of a market order is significant. Market orders placed outside of the standard market session will not be considered for execution until the market opens. It\\'s especially risky to enter market orders outside of the standard market session. A lot can happen between sessions, and an order will execute at the next standard session\\'s opening bid or ask price, which may be drastically different from the anticipated price. Schwab does not allow market orders during extended-hours trading. Fast markets – The speed of movements in price can also affect a market order\\'s execution price. When the market fluctuates, particularly during periods of high trading volume, the price at which your order executes may not be the same as the price you saw while building or submitting your order. A market order carries the risk of unexpected or unfavorable execution. Also, due to the speed at which market orders are executed, it is almost impossible to cancel a market order once it has been submitted. Make sure to check your order for accuracy before submitting it, as you most likely will not be able to change or cancel it afterward. Liquidity – When you place an order \"at the market,\" which consists of the best bid and ask price, you may receive different prices for parts of the order, especially for orders where the number of shares is relatively large when compared to the available liquidity. Consider a security\\'s liquidity when evaluating whether to use market orders. The impact of liquidity on a market order can be particularly significant when trading illiquid securities. It\\'s possible that relatively few outstanding shares may exist, or trading volume may be relatively low. If that\\'s the case, then the last trade price may not necessarily be current as the trade may have occurred minutes or hours ago. Basically, the fewer the shares traded, the greater the impact each transaction can potentially have on the next available price. Sometimes individual transactions \"wipe out the bid or ask\" when not enough shares are available for purchase or sale at the current price. In some cases, this occurs because a market order, generally for a large quantity of shares, is greater than the available shares posted at the best bid or ask. Subsequent fill prices may differ greatly from the initial fill price. No market for the security – A market order cannot execute when no bid or ask exists. If you want to buy 100 shares of a stock, but there are currently no offers to sell, your order will not execute. Likewise, if you entered an order to sell, but no bids were made to purchase shares, the sell order would not execute. Although rare, this scenario is more likely to occur when trading very low-volume, or \"thinly traded,\" stocks. As with any order type, market orders will not execute if the security itself is not open for trading. This may result from a late opening, a trading halt on the security, or a security no longer available for trade. What\\'s next? Market orders can be a useful tool if your trading priority is immediate execution and you are willing to accept the risk of unexpected and unfavorable execution. You should understand how market hours, liquidity, and market speed can affect the execution and pricing of a market order.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Using a limit order is one way for a trader to gain better control of their order. Understanding what order types are, why and when traders use them, and what factors impact their execution can help you match an order type to your specific trade objectives. Limit order A limit order is an order to either buy stock at a designated maximum price per share or sell stock at a minimum price share. For buy limit orders, you’re essentially setting a price ceiling—the highest price you’d be willing to pay for each share. For sell limit orders, you’re setting a price floor—the lowest amount you’d be willing to accept for each share you sell. This means that your order may only be filled at your designated price or better. However, you’re also directing your order to fill only if this condition occurs. Limit orders allow control over the price of an execution, but they do not guarantee that the order will be executed immediately or even at all. When to use limit orders Unlike market orders, which can only be executed during the standard market session, limit orders can be entered for execution during pre-market, standard, and after-hours trading sessions. Pre-market and after-hours limit orders are valid for execution only during that particular electronic trading session (7:00 a.m. – 9:25 a.m. ET for pre-market or 4:05 p.m. – 8:00 p.m. ET for after-hours sessions) and expire at the end of that session if they haven’t been filled or canceled. However, limit orders for the standard trading session (9:30 a.m.−4:00 p.m. ET) allow a trader to determine the duration. Day limit orders expire at the end of the current trading session and do not carry over to after-hours sessions. Good-till-canceled (GTC) limit orders carry forward from one standard session to the next, until executed, expired, or manually canceled by the trader. Each broker-dealer sets the expiration timeframe. At Schwab, GTC orders expire 60 calendar days from the date the order was submitted. Traders should navigate pre-market and after-hours trading sessions carefully, as liquidity rarely matches that of the regular market session. Limit order advantages Why might traders consider entering a limit order? Price ceilings/price floors – The ability to set a price ceiling on a purchase, or a price floor for a sale, is especially important when operating in a volatile and/or fast-moving market or trading thinly traded issues. Pre-market and after-hours sessions – Since market orders cannot be executed during pre-market or after-hours sessions, limit orders allow traders to participate in these extended-hours trading sessions. Additionally, limit orders placed for the standard exchange trading session enable the trader to decide whether the order should remain in force during the current day only or carry over to future standard trading sessions. Limit order risks Limit orders offer many advantages, but in exchange for having control over the price you’re paying or accepting, you’ll face some tradeoffs. Therefore, you should understand the factors that affect how a limit order will execute or whether it will execute at all. Risk of no execution – Limit orders allow you to seek a specific price or better, but they do not guarantee that an execution will occur because the price may never reach your limit price. Even if trading activity touches the limit order price for a short time, an execution still might not occur if other orders ahead of yours use all or part of the shares available at the current price. In addition, market orders are always executed prior to limit orders. To help avoid this situation, some traders place their limit order prices slightly above the best ask price for buy limit orders or slightly below the best bid price for sell limit orders. This allows for a small amount of price fluctuation while still protecting the trader from an unexpected price execution. Risk of partial fills – Limit orders also risk a “partial fill,” an execution of some of the shares in an order, but not all of them, which leaves the unfilled shares as an open order. While many brokerage firms offer commission-free trading, this is an important point for those trades that do carry commissions. Multiple fills on a single order within a single trading day typically involve one commission since all of the fills occur on the same day. However, executing parts of a single order across multiple days incurs a commission for each trading day on which an execution occurs. If an order executes over four days, you could pay four separate commissions. You can lower the risk of partial executions by applying special conditions to limit orders. Specifying “all or none,” “fill or kill,” “immediate or cancel,” and “minimum quantity” can help refine your order to suit your trading strategy. However, these special conditions can further reduce the overall chance of your order being executed. What’s next? Limit orders can be a useful tool if your trading priority is price guarantee and you are willing to accept the risk of partial fills or your order not being executed at all.'},\n",

However, the last trade price may not necessarily be current, particularly in the case of less-liquid stocks, whose last trade may have occurred minutes or hours ago. This might also be the case in fast-moving markets, when stock prices can change significantly in a short period of time. Therefore, when placing a market order, the current bid and offer prices are generally of greater importance than the last trade price. Generally, market orders should be placed only during market hours. A market order placed when markets are closed would be executed at the next market open, which could be significantly higher or lower from its prior close. Between market sessions, numerous factors can impact a stock\\'s price, such as the release of earnings, company news or economic data, or unexpected events that affect an entire industry, sector or the market as a whole. What is a limit order and how does it work? A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stock with a restriction on the maximum price to be paid or the minimum price to be received (the \"limit price\"). If the order is filled, it will only be at the specified limit price or better. However, there is no assurance of execution. A limit order may be appropriate when you think you can buy at a price lower than--or sell at a price higher than--the current quote. Source: StreetSmart Edge®. The above chart illustrates the use of market orders versus limit orders. In this example, the last trade price was roughly $139. A trader who wants to purchase (or sell) the stock as quickly as possible would place a market order, which would in most cases be executed immediately at or near the stock\\'s current price of $139 (white line)--provided that the market was open when the order was placed and barring unusual market conditions. A trader who wants to buy the stock when it dropped to $133 would place a buy limit order with a limit price of $133 (green line). If the stock falls to $133 or lower, the limit order would be triggered and the order would be executed at $133 or below. If the stock fails to fall to $133 or below, no execution would occur. A trader who wants to sell the stock when it reached $142 would place a sell limit order with a limit price of $142 (red line). If the stock rises to $142 or higher, the limit order would be triggered and the order would be executed at $142 or above. If the stock fails to rise to $142 or above, no execution would occur. Note, even if the stock reaches the specified limit price, your order may not be filled, because there may be orders ahead of yours that eliminate the availability of shares at the limit price. (Limit orders are generally executed on a first-come, first served basis.) Also note that with a limit order, the price at which the order is executed can be lower than the limit price, in the case of a buy order, or higher than the limit price, in the case of a sell order. If the limit order to buy at $133 was set as \"Good \\'til Canceled,\" rather than \"Day Only,\" it would still be in effect the following trading day. If the stock were to open at $130, the buy limit order would be triggered and the purchase price expected to be around $130--a more favorable price to the buyer. Conversely, with the sell limit order at $142, if the stock were to open at $145, the limit order would be triggered and be filled at a price close to $145--again, more favorable to the seller. What is a stop order, and how is it used? A stop order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the market price once the stock has traded at or through a specified price (the \"stop price\"). If the stock reaches the stop price, the order becomes a market order and is filled at the next available market price. If the stock fails to reach the stop price, the order is not executed. A stop order may be appropriate in these scenarios: When a stock you own has risen and you want to attempt to protect your gain should it begin to fall When you want to buy a stock as it breaks out above a certain level, believing that it will continue to rise A sell stop order is sometimes referred to as a \"stop-loss\" order because it can be used to help protect an unrealized gain or seek to minimize a loss. A sell stop order is entered at a stop price below the current market price; if the stock drops to the stop price (or trades below it), the stop order to sell is triggered and becomes a market order to be executed at the market\\'s current price. This sell stop order is not guaranteed to execute near your stop price. A stop order may also be used to buy. A buy stop order is entered at a stop price above the current market price (in essence \"stopping\" the stock from getting away from you as it rises). Let\\'s revisit our previous example, but look at the potential impacts of using a stop order to buy and a stop order to sell--with the stop prices the same as the limit prices previously used. While the two graphs may look similar, note that the position of the red and green arrows is reversed: the stop order to sell would trigger when the stock price hits $133 (or below), and would be executed as a market order at the current price. So, if the stock were to fall further after hitting the stop price, it\\'s possible that the order could be executed at a price that\\'s lower than the stop price. Conversely, for the stop order to buy, once the stop price of $142 is reached, the order could be executed at a higher price. Source: StreetSmart Edge. What are price gaps? A price gap occurs when a stock\\'s price makes a sharp move up or down with no trading occurring in between. It can be due to factors like earnings announcements, a change in an analyst\\'s outlook or a news release. Gaps frequently occur at the open of major exchanges, when news or events outside of trading hours have created an imbalance in supply and demand. Stop orders and price gaps Remember that the key difference between a limit order and a stop order is that the limit order will only be filled at the specified limit price or better; whereas, once a stop order triggers at the specified price, it will be filled at the prevailing price in the market--which means that it could be executed at a price significantly different than the stop price. The next chart shows a stock that \"gapped down\" from $29 to $25.20 between its previous close and its next opening. A stop order to sell at a stop price of $29--which would trigger at the market\\'s open because the stock\\'s price fell below the stop price and, as a market order, execute at $25.20--could be significantly lower than intended, and worse for the seller. Stop order: Gaps down can result in an unexpected lower price. Source: StreetSmart Edge. Limit orders and price gaps In a similar way that a \"gap down\" can work against you with a stop order to sell, a \"gap up\" can work in your favor in the case of a limit order to sell, as illustrated in the chart below. In this example, a limit order to sell is placed at a limit price of $50. The stock\\'s prior closing price was $47. If the stock opened at $63.00 due to positive news released after the prior market\\'s close, the trade would be executed at the market\\'s open at that price--higher than anticipated, and better for the seller. Limit order: Gap up can result in an unexpected higher price. Source: StreetSmart Edge. The bottom line Many factors can affect trade executions. In addition to using different order types, traders can specify other conditions that affect an order\\'s time in effect, volume or price constraints. Before placing your trade, become familiar with the various ways you can control your order; that way, you will be much more likely to receive the outcome you are seeking.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Here are seven strategies to help you improve your futures trading knowledge.',\n",
       "   'content': 'In the world of futures trading, success can mean significant profits—but mistakes can be extremely costly. That’s why it’s so important to have a strategy in place before you start trading. Here are seven tips for how to proceed. 1. Establish a trade plan The first tip simply can’t be emphasized enough: Plan your trades carefully before you establish a position. This means having not only a profit objective, but also an exit plan in case the trade goes against you. The goal here is to minimize the possibility you’ll need to make important decisions when you’re already in the market with money at risk. You don’t want emotions like fear and greed dictating your moves by luring you into holding onto a losing position too long or exiting a profitable position too soon. A carefully wrought trading plan that includes risk-management tools such as stop-loss orders, which we will discuss below, or bracket orders, can help protect you from such errors. For example, say you bought one contract of December silver at $20.00 per ounce. With a bracket order, you could set a stop loss exit at $18.00 per ounce and a profit exit at $25.00 per ounce. That way, you’re attempting to limit your risk to $2 per ounce, while maintaining a profit potential of $5 per ounce. 2. Protect your positions Committing to an exit strategy in advance can help protect you from significant contrary moves. Too many traders try to use “mental stops,” picking a price in their heads for when they will close out a position and minimize their losses. But these are too easy to ignore, even for the most disciplined traders. To make your commitment more firm, consider trading with stop-loss orders. The idea is to decide on a bailout point first, and then set a stop at that price. One-Triggers-Other (OTO) orders allow you to place a primary order and a protective stop at the same time. When the primary order executes, the protective stop is automatically triggered. This frees you from having to constantly watch the market, and relieves you from having to worry about entering your stop order at the right time. Just remember, though, there is no guarantee that execution of a stop order will be at or near the stop price. Stops are not a guarantee against losses—markets can sometimes move quickly through them. But, in the majority of cases, a stop will help you keep your losses at a manageable level and keep your emotions out of it. 3. Narrow your focus, but not too much Don’t spread yourself thin by trying to follow and trade too many markets. Most traders have their hands full keeping abreast of a few markets. Remember that futures trading is hard work and requires a substantial investment of time and energy. Studying charts, reading market commentary, staying on top of the news—it can be a lot for even the most seasoned trader. If you try to follow and trade too many markets, there’s a good chance you won’t give any of them the time and attention they require. The opposite is also true—trading just one market may not be a terrific approach, either. Just as diversification in the stock market has well-known benefits, there can be advantages to diversifying your futures trading, too. For instance, suppose you expected gold prices to decline, but the cocoa market to rally. If one of those expectations proved wrong, while the other was right, you could offset a loss with a gain. 4. Pace your trading If you’re new to trading futures, don’t floor the accelerator. There’s no reason to begin trading five or 10 contracts at a time when you’re just beginning. Don’t make the beginner’s mistake of using all the money in your account to purchase or sell as many futures contracts as you absolutely can. Occasional drawdowns are inevitable, so you should avoid establishing a large position where just one or two bad trades can wipe you out financially. Instead, start slowly with one or two contracts, and develop a trading methodology, without the added pressure that comes with managing larger positions. Tweak your trading as necessary, and if you find a style or strategy that’s working well, then consider increasing your order size. If you’re a new futures trader or a veteran that has hit a rough patch, you might also consider downsizing your contracts. In some cases, exchanges offer E-mini futures and Micro E-mini futures products that are identical to standard futures products except smaller. The CME Group, for instance, offers an E-mini S&P 500 futures contract that’s identical to its flagship S&P 500 futures contract, except it’s just one-fifth the size. There are similar mini products in the grain, energy, currency, and metals sectors. Once you’ve found a strategy you’re comfortable with, you can slowly increase your order size. 5. Think long—and short Trading opportunities present themselves in both rising and falling markets. It’s human nature to look for chances to buy, or “go long” the market. But if you’re not also open to “going short” a market, you might unnecessarily limit your trading opportunities. Here’s an example: Suppose a trader believes the price of crude oil is going to fall and looks to take a position by selling December crude oil futures at the current price of $50.00 per barrel, with the hope to buy back the futures contract at a later date at a profit should the futures price fall below $50.00 per barrel. With futures you can sell the market or buy the market. You can buy first, and then sell a contract to close out your position. Or, you can sell first, and later buy a contract to offset your position. There’s no practical difference between the trades: Whatever order you sell or buy in, you’ll have to post the required margin for the market you’re trading. So, don’t overlook opportunities to go short. 6. Learn from margin calls If you’re hit with a margin call, it’s probably because you’ve stayed with a losing trade too long. So, consider treating a margin shortfall as a wake-up call that you’ve become emotionally attached to a position that’s not working as planned. Rather than transferring additional funds to meet the call or shrinking your open positions to reduce your margin requirement, you may be better off exiting the losing position completely. As the old trading expression goes, “cut your losses,” and look for the next trading opportunity. 7. Be patient Don’t get so wrapped up in market action that you lose sight of the larger trading picture. You should obviously monitor your working orders, open positions, and account balances. But don’t hang on every uptick or downtick in the market. Not only can you drive yourself crazy, but you could also be thrown by small zigzags or whipsaws that appear formidable and significant in the moment but ultimately prove to be just intraday blips. In other words, try to maintain a little longer-term perspective. Lengthening the duration of your trades could work better than trying to trade every move in the market.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Buying your first home can be exciting—and stressful. Beyond the challenge of finding the right home in the right neighborhood, you'll also be grappling with some financial questions that are unlike those you may have faced as a renter. Here are seven tips to help you prepare to become a homeowner. Don't buy a home primarily as an investment. Even if you live in an area where prices typically have appreciated, you can't be sure that will continue. If financial return is the primary consideration, other types of investments, such as stocks or bonds, might be better for you. Owning a home is as much a personal investment as a financial one. Before you commit, assess your job stability and desire to stay in a particular location. As a rule of thumb, unless you plan to own a property for at least five years, buying may not work in your favor from a financial perspective. Know what you can afford. You can use Schwab Bank's mortgage calculator to get a sense of how much you can afford to borrow based on your monthly income and other financial obligations. There are no hard-and-fast rules for how much debt you can take on—though if your mortgage is insured by the Federal Housing Administration, your housing costs generally shouldn't be more than 31% of your gross monthly income. No matter what calculation you use, the key is to not overburden yourself. Check your credit score. Having a better credit score can mean lower mortgage rates. If you're concerned about your score, you can always take steps to boost it before you start hunting for houses. Paying your bills on time and keeping your credit card balances low can help. Understand the other costs involved. Buying a home could involve more than just monthly mortgage payments. You will also have to pay property taxes and will likely have to carry some kind of homeowners' insurance. Before buying a home, you will want to get a home inspection, which can help you budget for major repairs such as a new roof or foundation, not to mention routine maintenance costs and any upgrades. If you're looking at a condo or homes in a community that offers shared facilities such as a pool, you might also have to pay monthly association fees. Such expenses could become a real headache in the event of a job loss or financial setback. Plan to put down at least 20%. Most lenders won't require you to put at least 20% down these days, but it's a good idea to do this anyway. Otherwise, your lender will probably require you to carry private mortgage insurance (PMI). That means you'll pay monthly PMI premiums in addition to your mortgage payments until your loan-to-value ratio reaches 80%. In general, the higher your down payment, the easier it will be to qualify for a mortgage loan and negotiate the lowest rate. Also, the more you agree to put down, the likelier the chance that your purchase is competitive with other bids, as financing can be a key consideration when sellers review multiple offers. Know what documents you will need for your loan. Some of the more commonly requested documents include a fully executed agreement of sale for the property being purchased, financial statements for bank and brokerage accounts, pay stubs, previous W2s, IRS Form 4506 (which authorizes a mortgage lender to obtain copies of a borrower's tax returns directly from the IRS), and homeowners' insurance policies. Get pre-approved for a loan. Getting pre-approved lets you know how much home you can buy before you go house hunting. Plus, it lets real estate agents and sellers know that you're a serious buyer because your financing is already arranged—which can be an advantage when making an offer. The bottom line The process may seem arduous, but for many people, the stress of home buying is outweighed by the pleasures of home ownership. Just remember that a little advance planning—and saving—can make the buying process much easier.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'If you’re interested in contributing to a Roth IRA but your income exceeds IRS limits, you can still save for retirement in a tax-smart way.',\n",
       "   'content': 'High earners may have a variety of options for saving for retirement—but income limits mean that direct contributions to Roth IRAs may not be among them.1 This is unfortunate because Roth IRAs offer tax-free earnings growth and withdrawals in retirement,2 making them a potentially valuable part of a broader investing and tax-planning strategy. Having both Traditional and Roth accounts can help with tax diversification in retirement. Here are some strategies to consider. Are you getting the most from your 401(k)s? Maxing out contributions to a traditional 401(k) is a good place to start. Such accounts have no income phase-out limits, so you can generally contribute the lesser of your income or $20,500 (plus an additional $6,500 if you are 50 or older). Pre-tax contributions to these accounts reduce your taxable income, and potential earnings will grow on a tax-deferred basis—though distributions in retirement are subject to taxation at ordinary income rates in the future. If your employer also offers access to a Roth 401(k), then you could consider using one to set aside some post-tax retirement savings. Like their traditional 401(k) counterparts, Roth 401(k)s don\\'t have income phase-outs. So even if you don\\'t qualify for a Roth IRA because your income is above IRS limits, you can make after-tax contributions to a Roth 401(k). Potential earnings will grow tax-free, and you pay no taxes when you take withdrawals over the age of 59 1/2, as long as you\\'ve held the account for at least five years. If you own both a traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k), it\\'s important to note that the annual contribution limit applies across all of your 401(k) accounts, not on each account individually. Consider a Roth conversion Converting some or all of the funds in a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA is another option. This entails taking funds from traditional IRAs, paying ordinary income tax on those funds, and rolling them into a Roth IRA. This can make sense particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future and have a long time horizon. Some advisors also see a so-called backdoor Roth IRA as another way to secure the tax features provided by Roth accounts. It\\'s a unique strategy, but it could work for you. The backdoor Roth involves opening a traditional IRA, making non-deductible contributions to it, and rolling over those funds to a Roth IRA at a later date. When those funds are rolled over, you\\'ll have to pay taxes on any appreciation that occurred prior to the conversion; in addition, the pro-rata rule may also apply. However, once in the Roth IRA, the savings are eligible to grow and be distributed tax-free. What about non-deductible IRAs? Does it ever make sense to contribute to a traditional IRA even if you can\\'t deduct the contributions? At the very least, you could still enjoy the potential for tax-deferred growth in the account. \"Think carefully before considering this option,\" says Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"You wouldn\\'t be getting any upfront tax break, and future withdrawals of growth on your original contribution would be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.\" It\\'s possible that the future tax rates you\\'d pay would be higher than what you would owe if you\\'d invested in a tax-efficient way in a regular taxable brokerage account. \"With today\\'s low long-term capital gains and qualified dividend rates, non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA may make less sense,\" Rob says. As of 2022, long-term capital gains are taxed at a federal rate of either: 0% for single filers with taxable income up to $41,675 or joint filers with taxable income up to $83,350. 15% for single filers with taxable income between $41,676-$459,750 or joint filers with taxable income between $83,351-$517,200. 20% for single filers with taxable income above $459,750 or joint filers with taxable income above $517,200. In addition, single filers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) over $200,000 or joint filers with AGI over $250,000 may have to pay the Medicare surtax of 3.8%. Tax-efficient investing in a taxable account There are many tax-efficient ways to invest in taxable accounts. If you don\\'t trade often, individual stocks, as well as most exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index mutual funds, can result in a lower tax bill. You may owe only the long-term capital gains tax rate on earnings if you sell an investment held longer than a year at a gain, which is generally lower than the tax rates on ordinary income. There may be some distributions along the way, but qualified dividends from stocks are generally taxed at the long-term capital gain tax rate, and ETFs and index funds can be managed tax-efficiently. Having some money in taxable accounts can provide opportunities to reduce your tax bill by strategically harvesting losses. That\\'s not something you can do in your 401(k) or any IRA. Investing in tax-advantaged municipal bonds or muni bond funds, depending on your tax bracket, can help too. Saving in a taxable account can also be helpful for estate planning goals. If you hold long-term investments in a traditional brokerage account, you can donate low-cost-basis securities to charity for a full fair market value deduction and no capital gains tax. You can also leave your appreciated shares to heirs who would receive a step-up in cost basis. Finally, as noted above, having money in taxable accounts as well as tax-advantaged accounts can give you greater flexibility and access to savings for needs prior to age 59 1/2—the minimum age from which you can generally withdraw from traditional IRAs and qualified retirement plans without a 10% early withdrawal penalty.3 It can also provide flexibility in managing your tax bracket as you plan for post-retirement cash flows. \"This sort of tax diversification can be helpful, no matter your future tax rate,\" Rob says. 1For 2022, as a single filer, your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) must be under $144,000 to contribute to a Roth IRA. As a joint filer, it must be under $214,000. 2You must be 59 1/2 and have held the Roth IRA for 5 years before tax-free withdrawals on earnings are permitted. 3Subject to certain exceptions, for hardship or other situations specified by the IRS.'},\n",

You set up the ESA and choose how to invest the money, typically on behalf of the child beneficiary. When you invest in an ESA, you don’t have to pay taxes on investment income or capital gains, which means your money has a chance to compound faster. Even better, withdrawals are free from federal taxes so long as you use the money for qualified education expenses, such as tuition, books, supplies, uniforms, room and board, computer equipment and internet service. Tax-free withdrawals apply not only to college expenses, but also elementary and secondary education expenses—regardless if the school is public or private, secular or religious.1 The table below shows how Coverdell Education Savings Accounts compare to 529 plans. ESA 529 Plan Tax-free withdrawals > ESA Qualified expenses for kindergarten through college > 529 Plan Qualified expenses for college; up to $10,000 for primary or secondary school tuition* > Investment options > ESA Many > 529 Plan Limited > Income eligibility limit for contributors > ESA Annual contributions are capped at $2,000 for joint filers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) up to $190,000, and are gradually reduced for MAGI between $190,000 and $220,000. Incomes above $220,000 are ineligible.† > 529 Plan None‡ > Disclosures *Check with the state’s 529 plan rules to see if they permit this option. Not all states follow the new federal tax rules. You may be subject to state income tax and penalties for using 529 amounts for K-12 tuition expenses. †Annual contributions for single filers are capped at $2,000 for MAGI up to $95,000, and are phased out for MAGI between $95,000 and $110,000. ‡Gift taxes may apply if you contribute more than $15,000 per year ($30,000 for couples). It’s also possible to contribute a lump sum of up to $75,000 to one or more 529 college savings plan in a single year ($150,000 for couples) without being subject to the gift tax. However, if you contribute more money on behalf of the same child during those five years, you may trigger the gift tax. ESAs provide more investment flexibility than 529s, and don’t have the 529’s $10,000 tax-free withdrawal cap for qualified expenses to an elementary or secondary public, private or religious school. Unlike 529 plans, there’s an income eligibility limit and a relatively low limit on contributions. The annual maximum is $2,000 per beneficiary—or less for higher earners—which means if you (as a parent) contribute all $2,000, grandparents and other individuals are not allowed to make additional contributions to the account during that year. The good news is your child can be the beneficiary of both a 529 plan and an ESA, and you can contribute to both accounts in the same year. Alternative options for ESAs Like 529 savings plans, if your child decides not to attend college, or there is money left in the ESA account after he or she graduates, the remaining savings can still be used. Unlike a 529 savings plan, an ESA must be distributed when the designated beneficiary reaches age 30, unless he or she is a special needs beneficiary. You can change the beneficiary on the account to another member of the original beneficiary’s family who is under age 30. The IRS broadly defines the term “family member” to include everyone from siblings and parents to step-siblings and in-laws. If you withdraw funds for non-qualified expenses, any untaxed earnings are taxable to the beneficiary, along with a 10% federal penalty. How to open and contribute to an ESA Anyone can set up an ESA at a brokerage or other financial institution, or directly with a mutual fund company. Once an ESA is opened in your child’s name, anyone can contribute as long as they follow a few rules: No more than $2,000 per year can be put in a child’s ESA(s). The beneficiary must be under age 18 during the year of contribution (unless he or she is a special-needs child). The $2,000 maximum is dependent on your filing status and modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Joint filers with a MAGI of less than $190,000 ($95,000 for single filers) can contribute up to the full amount. Contribution limits are lower at higher MAGIs, and are completely phased out for joint filers with a MAGI of $220,000 or more ($110,000 for single filers), as shown in the table above. The money must be used (or transferred to another beneficiary) before the child turns 30. You can change the beneficiary to another family member once per year. You have until Tax Day of the following year to contribute for the previous year. Effect on financial aid ESAs generally receive favorable treatment when it comes to calculating financial aid eligibility, similar to a 529 plan. (With a 529 held in a parent’s name, typically only 5.64% of the assets are considered available for college expenses). However, schools might use slightly different formulas to calculate financial aid eligibility, which could mean ESA accounts listed under a grandparent or non-relative’s name might have to be reported. Saving and investing for college is a wise move, even if you believe your child may qualify for financial aid. Remember, the majority of financial aid comes in the form of loans, which must be repaid with interest. Consider your options There are a number of resources for financial aid information, including the U.S. Department of Education and College Board. It’s always a good idea to check with your financial planner and a qualified tax advisor to determine which education savings route is best for you and your family. 1Although virtually all accredited public, nonprofit, and proprietary (privately owned profit-making) post-secondary institutions are eligible, there are criteria set by state law and the Department of Education that must be met by the institutions.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I work for a small nonprofit. I love my job but don't make a lot of money, so saving for retirement is hard. The company offers a retirement plan that I contribute to, but there's no match. How can I save more? —A Reader Dear Reader, This is a great question—and a great time to be asking it. With the challenges of the past year still fresh and people struggling to get back to some sort of normal, saving money is on everybody's mind, whether it's for planned expenses, an emergency fund, retirement or all of the above. On the positive side, Americans on average have been saving more, with personal savings rates the highest they've been in years. However, for a lot of folks, saving—especially for retirement—is an ongoing challenge. So I'm happy your question gives me the chance to talk about a benefit from Uncle Sam that few people are aware of: the Saver's Credit—a special tax break for low-to-moderate income taxpayers who are specifically saving for retirement. And with April 15 just ahead, there's still time to take advantage of it for this tax year. Here's how it works. What it does The Saver's Credit gives you a tax credit of 50 percent, 20 percent or 10 percent on the first $2,000 in contributions you make to a retirement account. The percentage you get depends on your adjusted gross income (AGI) and filing status, but you could potentially claim a credit of up to $1,000—or up to $2,000 if you file jointly with your spouse. You might think of it as a retirement match from the government. The Saver’s Credit is applied directly to your tax bill to reduce the amount of income tax you owe. For instance, if your tax bill is $1,000 and your credit is $400, you'd only owe $600. If your tax bill is $1,000 and your credit is $1,000, it's a wash. You'd owe nothing. What if your tax bill is $500 and your credit is $1,000? Unfortunately, you'd only get the $500 applied to your bill. The Saver's Credit is non-refundable, meaning if your credit is larger than your bill, you don't get the difference. How you qualify To qualify, you must be 18 or older, not a full-time student, and not claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return. Then you have to meet the AGI requirements. AGI is your gross income minus adjustments such as deductible retirement contributions, self-employment taxes, educator expenses and student loan interest. To qualify for a 50 percent credit when filing your taxes for 2021, a single filer’s AGI can’t be more than $19,750. The AGI limit for a 20 percent credit is $21,500; for a 10 percent credit it's $33,000. The AGI limits for married filing jointly are $39,500, $43,000 and $66,000 respectively. These income limits have increased for 2022. Of course, the final qualification is that you make a contribution to a retirement account. It's important to note that rollover contributions do not qualify for the credit, and eligible contributions may be reduced by recent retirement account distributions. There's lots of flexibility here because a wide range of retirement accounts are included: traditional and Roth IRAs, traditional and Roth 401(k)s, 403(b)s, 457 plans, SIMPLE and SEP IRAs, as well as TSP and ABLE accounts. So let's say you're single, your income is $21,500 and you contributed $1,200 to your company retirement plan. You could claim a 20 percent tax credit of $240. Now let's say you file jointly with your spouse, your combined AGI is $39,500 and you each put $1,000 (a total of $2,000) into an IRA. You'd both be able to claim a 50 percent tax credit for a total of $1,000. When to claim it First, be sure to make any 2021 IRA contributions by April 15 of 2021. Then you may be able to claim the Saver's Credit when you file your regular income taxes. The deadline for making 2021 contributions to other types of accounts eligible for the Saver’s Credit mentioned above was December 31, 2021. You'll need to file IRS form 8880, which will ask for your AGI. And remember, a retirement contribution may be tax deductible, which can lower your AGI. So you could potentially get the benefit of the tax deduction for your contribution as well as the tax credit. It's kind of a double reward for saving. If you need help with determining if you qualify for the Saver’s Credit check out the IRS’s Interactive Tax Assistant. If you need more help with tax preparation, you may also qualify for free tax assistance from the IRS's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program. Other ways to boost your savings The Saver's Credit can be a welcome extra if you qualify, but even if you don't there are other ways to give your savings a boost. First, make sure that saving is included in your budget. Then set up automatic monthly transfers from your checking account to a savings account to make it easy. Think of it as paying yourself first. If you have a company retirement plan, make sure you contribute enough to get any match. Upping your contribution by even a small percentage will increase your savings in the long run. No company plan? Stay at home spouse? You and your spouse may still be able to open an IRA and start making regular contributions. Also, look into a Health Savings Account (HSA) if you have a high deductible health plan. This is a great way to plan ahead for medical expenses, supplement retirement savings and save on taxes. Finally, whenever you get a windfall—a raise, a bonus, a tax refund, even a gift—consider putting some of it in savings. The amounts you save may seem small at first, but don't get discouraged. They will add up over time. Then take the next step and invest your savings to help it potentially grow faster. With both saving and investing, time and consistency are two of the key factors in achieving your goals. Stick with it! Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My boyfriend is on his phone all the time trading stocks. Sometimes he makes a lot of money quickly and other times he gets upset because he loses. Overall, though, he says it’s fun and that I should invest too (right now all of my money is in savings). To me, it all feels like gambling and scares me. Am I missing something? —A Reader Dear Reader, I can’t say for sure what your boyfriend is doing, but I think you’re on to something important with the recent GameStop episode being the most recent and extreme example of stock speculating gone awry. Online tools have made it very easy to trade stocks with a simple click, often at no cost. Although this is convenient, it also allows people to buy and sell stocks without carefully thinking through their decisions. And therein lies the potential problem—and the distinction I make between sound investing and wild speculating (or as you say, ‘gambling’). Your question also brings me back to when I was in my early twenties. Like you, I had always been a good saver, but I was at a loss when it came to choosing investments for my first IRA. I turned to my father, whose advice was simple: “Pick two broad-based equity funds and split your money.” Like your boyfriend, I wanted to see a quick profit, and was sorely disappointed. It took me years to understand the wisdom behind my father’s words: building wealth through investing isn’t about hot stock tips or fast trades, but about starting early and participating in the markets consistently throughout one’s lifetime. I was fortunate that my father got me started on the right foot. True investing isn’t like gambling. And it’s much more than saving. It’s serious business, for sure, but it can be immensely rewarding and potentially a great way for both you and your boyfriend to reach your long-term goals. Saving and investing work hand-in-hand Saving and investing are completely different animals. But despite their differences, they work hand-in-hand in building long-term wealth and financial security. Saving money is spending less than you earn and setting that money aside for the future—whether that’s for an emergency or for a specific goal like a vacation or a new home. Most savings are held in conservative accounts that are safe and easily accessible but have minimal growth potential. That's appropriate for short-term goals, but your savings are likely to lose value over time when taking inflation into account. When you invest, on the other hand, you're using money to try and make more money. As your investments grow in value, that growth can compound. Over time, this can lead to significant gains. Time is an essential ingredient, helping to smooth out market volatility That's why when you have a long-term goal like a child’s education or retirement, investing is especially important. Gambling and investing are totally at odds By contrast, gambling and prudent investing have nothing in common. When you gamble, you’re taking on risk for which you're not likely to be compensated. The longer you stick with it, the worse your odds become. I can’t be sure, but this sounds a lot like what your boyfriend is doing. Slick trading screens and rapid response times can be mesmerizing and may encourage excessive risk-taking. Consider what professional or institutional traders are doing. Unless he's carefully doing his research and thoroughly understands a company's financials, competitive landscape, and management strengths and weaknesses—and then considers how that company fits into his overall portfolio—he’s just rolling the dice every time he trades. Prudent investing isn’t about quick trades, but about staying invested and having a long-term time horizon. It’s not about “winners” and “losers” but about building a solid portfolio from the ground up, customized to your individual needs and goals. Yes, investing always involves risk, because markets go down as well, and companies sometimes go through rough times. But experienced, disciplined investors know how to mitigate those risks with a combination of proper asset allocation, diversification and a healthy dose of patience. It makes me think of the tortoise and the hare. Gamblers are looking for shortcuts to quickly reach a big jackpot, but more often than not, it’s the slow and steady investors who reach the finish line first. Not investing carries risks I’ve talked a bit about the risks inherent in investing, but I think it’s important to also appreciate the risks of not investing. By keeping your money in savings, you're losing the opportunity for growth that investing can provide. And you’re not alone. Big swings in the market scare away a number of people—including many young adults. According to the Federal Reserve of St. Louis, only about half of millennials (those born from 1981-1996) are invested in the stock market. I find this very troubling. As evidenced only last year, some scared investors jumped out of the market at exactly the wrong time, sealing in their losses. It's equally tragic that so many people also missed one of the fastest and steepest recoveries of all time. Year in and year out, the risks of not investing are very real and powerful. Taking your first steps as an investor I’ve always felt that reading as much as you can and asking questions is the best way to learn about something new. Investing is no exception, so I encourage you to seek out trusted resources and experts. New apps and platforms like robo-advisors, target date funds, and subscription-based planning make creating a diversified portfolio easier (and cheaper!) than ever, but aren't a substitute for doing your own research and creating a financial plan. These can be great solutions, but take the time to understand your risk tolerance time horizon—and ask questions before you invest. That’s not to say investing has to be boring. In fact, I think investing is endlessly fascinating. I’m a firm believer in broad-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds because of the immediate diversification they can provide. But you can also explore individual stocks with a portion of your money, perhaps through fractional shares. Thanks very much for your astute question. I wish you the best on your path to being a lifetime investor—and learner. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Margin can be a powerful tool to leverage your investment returns or to finance purchases apart from your portfolio. Traders should learn all they can about the benefits and risks of employing margin before deciding whether to incorporate it into their trading strategy. What is margin? Margin is an extension of credit from a brokerage firm using your own eligible securities as collateral. Most traders typically use margin as a means to purchase additional securities, but there are other uses too. Interest is charged on the borrowed funds for the period of time that the loan is outstanding. There is no set repayment schedule for a margin account loan; however, a certain minimum level of assets must remain in the margin account in order to maintain sufficient collateral. The use of margin is regulated by financial industry regulatory organizations and certain securities exchanges, and is subject to the policies of the broker-dealer holding the account. Benefits and features of a margin account A margin loan can provide a variety of key advantages: Leveraging of investments. Buying on margin affords you the potential to achieve greater investment returns by allowing you to own more securities than would be possible on a cash only basis. A margin account also enables you to sell short (borrow shares from your brokerage firm to sell immediately and repurchase them, hopefully, at a lower price in the future) and potentially profit from downward price movements. Trading flexibility. Take advantage of timely market opportunities or make investment changes when you want, as long as you maintain the minimum equity required. Portfolio diversification. If you hold a concentrated stock position, you can use margin to purchase other securities in order to diversify your portfolio. Convenience. Once the margin feature is approved and activated on your account, you can borrow against the account equity at any time without any additional paperwork or waiting for loan approvals (subject to the terms, limitations, and requirements of the firm\\'s margin agreement). Please note that some types of brokerage accounts are not eligible for margin (e.g., and without exclusion, IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, UGMAs and UTMAs). Repayment simplicity. There is no set repayment schedule as long as you maintain the required level of equity in your account. Competitive interest rates. Margin borrowing is generally more cost-effective than consumer lending options like credit cards. Ready line of credit. A margin loan is a ready source of credit that may be used for purchasing securities or other needs. Tax deductibility. Interest on margin loans may be tax deductible against your net investment income. However, you should consult your tax advisor regarding your own situation. The use of margin can magnify your profits as well as your losses. Let\\'s look at two examples that illustrate the upside potential, as well as the downside risks, of using margin and not using margin to purchase securities. (For the sake of simplicity, these examples do not take in consideration fees and taxes.) Example 1: the upside potential with and without using margin A gain achieved without the use of margin Assume you spend $5,000 cash to buy 100 shares of a $50 stock. A year later the price of the stock stands at $70. Your shares are now worth $7,000. You sell your shares and realize a profit of $2,000. A gain achieved with the use of margin What happens when you add margin into the mix? This time you use your $5,000 in cash and you also borrow another $5,000 on margin from your brokerage firm. This gives you buying power of $10,000 which allows you to buy 200 shares of that $50 stock instead of only 100 shares. If, a year later, the stock reaches $70 and your 200 shares are worth $14,000. You sell the shares and pay back the $5,000 margin loan you borrowed plus $400 in interest (this amount will vary depending on the amount of time the money is borrowed and the rate of interest charged by the brokerage firm) which leaves you with $8,600. If you subtract the $5,000 of cash you invested initially, this leaves of profit of $3,600. Where no margin was used, you earned a profit of $2,000 on an investment of $5,000 for a gain of 40%. Where margin was used—you earned a profit of $3,600 on that same $5,000 for a gain of 72%. Example 2: the downside risk with and without using margin Although margin can increase profits when stocks are rising in price, the magnifying effect can work against you as well. Let\\'s look another example, which illustrates the downside risk of using margin and not using margin to purchase securities. A loss incurred without the use of margin Jumping back into our first example, what if you use your $5,000 cash to buy 100 shares of a $50 stock, and it goes down to $30 over the course of the next year? Your shares are now worth $3,000, and you\\'ve lost $2,000. A loss incurred with the use of margin But what if you had borrowed an additional $5,000 on margin and purchased 200 shares of that $50 stock for $10,000? A year later when it hit $30, your shares would be worth $6,000. If you sell your shares for $6,000, you must pay back the $5,000 loan along with $400* interest, which leaves you with only $600 of your original $5,000—for a total loss of $4,400. Margin risks Margin exposure also presents additional risks. When considering a margin loan, you should determine how the use of margin fits your own risk tolerance and investment goals. It is important that you fully understand the risks involved with using margin: Leverage risk—Leveraging means using margin to potentially capture more returns than when investing on a cash-only basis. It is important to recognize that unfavorable market moves can negatively impact the value of your investments more rapidly. Leveraging exposes you to greater downside risk versus paying for securities in full because if the securities acting as collateral for your margin loan lose value, you must still either repay your brokerage the amount of money you borrowed on margin or be required to deposit more money into your account. Interest rate risk—Like any other loan, you must repay your margin loan along with interest, regardless of the underlying value of the securities purchased. Keep in mind that it is possible that margin interest rates may fluctuate during the time you have an outstanding loan. You may not receive any notice of a margin interest rate change from your brokerage firm. Maintenance call risk—If the equity in your account falls below the brokerage firm\\'s minimum maintenance requirements due to a decline in the value of your shares held as collateral, your brokerage firm will issue a \"maintenance call.\" A maintenance call requires you to deposit additional cash or acceptable collateral into your account promptly. Your brokerage firm may increase its margin maintenance requirements at any time without prior notice. Forced liquidation risk—If you fail to meet a margin call, your brokerage firm may close-out some or all of the securities in your account without contacting you. You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. After liquidation, your account may have no value, and you may still owe you brokerage firm for all or part of the original margin loan. Tips for managing margin risk Don\\'t be fully leveraged—Borrow less than the maximum amount allowable in your account to allow room for fluctuation in the event of an unfavorable market movement. Set a personal minimum account equity level for yourself that is higher than your brokerage firm\\'s house requirements and monitor your portfolio to check that you are not going below that equity level. Borrow against a diversified portfolio—This reduces the risk that a single security\\'s drop in value will trigger a margin maintenance call. Closely watch your portfolio—Be aware of what is going on in the market. Recognize that margin usage brings increased risk, and constantly reassess your risk tolerance. Anticipate a potential decline in value, especially during uncertain market conditions. Have a plan—When you use margin, it’s important to have a trade plan. Develop a risk management strategy for your investments that is consistent with your market outlook, and stick to it. Develop contingency plans for dealing with potential margin calls, and have a repayment plan ready if the market turns, if margin maintenance requirements rise, or if margin interest rates rise. *The calculations in this example do not take into account all interest charges, commissions or fees.'},\n",

That\\'s why some traders turn to technical analysis. The idea is that using a handful of technical indicators as a kind of sieve can help you sort through the broader market to identify, first, attractive sectors and, then, the potentially attractive stocks within them. Here\\'s how to do it. Technical analysis indicators The first step is know your indicators. Here are four popular ones: 1. Support and resistance: If an index or stock is bouncing between a consistent low and a consistent high, it is said to be \"range-bound.\" Drawing horizontal lines at these price levels can help you identify two key levels: support and resistance. Support is where downward trends tend to weaken as buying pressure overcomes selling pressure. Resistance is often where upward trends start to fizzle as selling pressure overcomes buying pressure. You can use these price levels to identify possible entry and exit points, whether you expect an index or stock to remain range-bound—or break through, potentially signaling the start of a strong new up or down trend.

To confirm a bullish trend, draw a line connecting all the price lows during a given period. If the line reveals a series of consistently higher lows, then the stock could be in a bullish trend. To confirm a possible bearish trend, draw a line connecting all the price highs. If the line reveals a series of consistently lower highs, then the stock could be in a bearish trend. Drawing one or both of these lines to create a trend channel can help you evaluate both the strength and duration of a market trend—for example, has the index or stock moved—or not—during your desired time frame, say, over the last week or month or quarter? Source: StreetSmart Edge. Source: StreetSmart Edge. 3. Moving averages: Moving averages reflect the recent price history of an index or stock. A simple moving average is the sum of the prices over a period of time divided by that time period. For example, a \"20 day Moving Average\" is the sum of the prices over 20 days divided by 20. Moving averages show you how the current price compares to an average price over an index or stock\\'s history. An index or stock with a current price above its moving average is performing better than it has during the period used to calculate the moving average. Typical moving average time frames are 20, 50, and 200 days, which approximate one month, 10 weeks, and 40 weeks, respectively. Some traders look at \"crossovers\"—when one moving average \"crosses\" over another—to see if a stock or index is bullish or bearish. For example, when a short-term moving average crosses over and above a longer-term one, that\\'s a bullish signal indicating that a stock\\'s recent performance has been stronger than it has over the longer term. Source: StreetSmart Edge. 4. Volume: Looking at volume in combination with price activity can indicate how strongly investors feel about a stock\\'s current pricing. Larger volume indicates greater conviction from the market. Lower volume may indicate less conviction. When volume exceeds its moving average, support for the price action may be growing. Source: StreetSmart Edge. Filtering the market Now that you\\'ve got some technical analysis indicators in hand, you can use them to start filtering the market. You could start by looking at the performance of a major index, such as the S&P 500® Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or the NASDAQ Composite Index. Technical analysts believe that what the market is actually doing is more important than why it might be doing it. Is the overall market trending up or down? How aligned are the major indexes? Where are the indexes in relation to support and resistance? Is volume supporting the current price trend? Filtering sectors Next, it\\'s time to figure out which sectors within the market are driving any trends. If the overall market is bullish, some sectors are likely to be very bullish. Likewise, if the overall market is bearish, some sectors will be particularly bearish. Identify the two or three sectors leading the trends using the indicators mentioned above. At this point, you\\'ve already narrowed your search down to a fairly small share of the market, without having to sort through particular companies. Filtering stocks Now the search gets more specific. Just as you looked for sectors that were leading the market trend, now you look for the stocks that are leading those sectors. This process will help you identify the \"strongest of the strong\" or the \"weakest of the weak.\" Once you\\'ve settled on a manageable list, you can filter a few different ways: One straightforward approach is to filter for stocks with prices above their moving averages. You could also look for stocks that have broken through support or resistance and have increasing volume. After winnowing down the list to a handful of potential candidates, you can scan each of their charts and choose the opportunities that best fit your trading style and goals. A simplified approach With a few steps and basic filters, you can effectively reduce thousands of choices to a qualified short list of stocks that meet your specific criteria while aligning with broader market trends, so you can make more objective decisions about what and when to trade.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"As traders, we're often so enamored of our winning trades that we ignore our losers. But it's our losers from which we stand to learn the most. Here are four ways to learn from the trades that didn't pan out. 1. Calculate your performance First things first: Gather your gain and loss data so you can begin to assess the factors affecting your overall performance. Instead of simply looking at total gains or losses, I like to display it as a ratio so I can dig deeper into where my profits and losses are coming from: For example, let's say I had 17 profitable trades with an average $150 gain per trade and eight unprofitable trades with an average $225 loss per trade: If I looked just at the net gain/loss ratio ($2,550 vs. $1,800), I might think I'd been doing pretty well with $750 in net profit and 17 profitable trades out of 25. Looking more closely at my average gain versus my average loss, however, I can see that I lost 1.5 times more money than I gained ($225 vs. $150), on average. The average gain versus average loss per trade also tells you how effectively you're managing and closing out your positions. If your average loss is uncomfortably close to your average gain, ask yourself: Do I generally stick to my original trade plans or diverge from them? When trades are profitable, what influences my decision to exit? When trades are unprofitable, do I exit within my planned risk parameters or hold on too long? Answering these questions can help you identify weaknesses and build better trading habits over time. 2. Drill down on your losers When it comes to learning from my past mistakes, I pay extra attention to my average losses because I have the most control over them. Even when you do your homework, a position can move against you without notice, turning a once-profitable trade into its inverse. It's how you control those situations that can make or break your success as a trader. If you've experienced a similar about-face with one or more of your trades, take a look at how long you allowed the position to fall before you acted. Focusing on my average losses helped me identify a bad habit in my own trading that was contributing to lackluster results: hanging on to unprofitable trades too long. Simply by exiting each losing trade before it reached my average loss, I noticed an immediate improvement in my performance. Indeed, you can be wrong more than you're right and still come out ahead—so long as you keep your average loss to a minimum. 3. Look at your expectancy Expectancy is the average dollar amount you expect to gain or lose per trade based on previous performance. It combines your percentage of profitable trades and average gain per trade with your percentage of losing trades and average loss per trade: For example, let's say 40% of your trades in the past six months were profitable and your average gain was $500 per trade, while 60% of your trades were unprofitable with an average loss per trade of $250. Using the calculation above, you could reasonably expect an average gain of $50 per trade: You should aim for an increasingly positive outcome with each trade. If the opposite is happening, revisit your losers to see where the breakdowns might be occurring. 4. Examine other variables Finally, it can be helpful to see if any patterns emerge by dividing your trades into categories, such as: Fundamental vs. technical analysis techniques Investment types Order types Time frames Trade size Do you find less success with longer-term trades, for example? Or when you choose exchange-traded funds versus stocks? Breaking down your positions in this way can help identify which strategies tend to work for you and which you may want to improve upon—or avoid altogether. Taking control Examining your trading performance on a regular basis can help you better understand the behaviors and other factors that may be influencing your outcomes. Paying particular attention to losses is a great way to identify shortcomings—and to up the ante on your trading approach.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'If you own foreign investments, you’ve probably paid foreign taxes on them. You may be able to avoid being taxed a second time on those investments if you claim a credit or deduction on your U.S. tax return. But which is the best choice?',\n",
       "   'content': 'If you invest in foreign markets and own stocks, bonds, mutual funds or income-producing investments, it\\'s likely that you paid foreign taxes on the income you earned. You may be able to avoid being taxed a second time on those investments if you claim a credit or deduction on your U.S. tax return. How do I know if I paid foreign taxes? The simplest way to see if you paid foreign taxes is to look at the Forms 1099 or Schedules K-1 you received. For example, the 2020 and 2021 Form 1099-DIV lists the foreign taxes paid in box 7. Should I take a tax credit or tax deduction? Most of the time, it\\'s better to take a tax credit. Tax credits reduce your tax bill dollar-for-dollar, which means a $500 tax credit will save you $500 in taxes. A tax deduction only reduces your taxable income, meaning a tax deduction\\'s benefit is equal to the reduction in taxable income multiplied by your tax rate. For example, let\\'s say you received $10,000 in foreign dividends, and you paid $1,000 in foreign taxes on that income. If you\\'re in the 25% tax bracket, you would have to pay an additional $2,500 in U.S. tax on those foreign dividends ($10,000 multiplied by the 25% tax rate). Here\\'s how the credit or deduction would affect your tax bill: If you claimed a $1,000 foreign tax credit, you could reduce your $2,500 U.S. tax bill on the dividends dollar-for-dollar, to $1,500. If you claimed a tax deduction, that $1,000 of foreign taxes would be used to reduce your dividend income from $10,000 to $9,000. Your tax bill would be $2,250 ($9,000 multiplied by your 25% tax rate). Generally, you must choose between a claiming a credit or a deduction—you\\'re not normally allowed to do both in a single year. However, you can change which one you choose each tax year. It seems obvious that the tax credit is the best choice, and in most cases it is. The downside to the tax credit is that additional paperwork is required. If your foreign tax credit is more than $300 for a single filer ($600 for married couples filing jointly), you will have to prepare Form 1116 to get the credit. This form can be complex to complete, depending on how many foreign tax credits you are claiming (more on this below). How to claim the foreign tax credit The IRS limits the foreign tax credit you can claim to the lesser of the amount of foreign taxes paid or the U.S. tax liability on the foreign income. For example, if you paid $350 of foreign taxes, and on that same income you would have owed $250 of U.S. taxes, your tax credit will be limited to $250. So what happens to that leftover $100 of foreign tax credit? Fortunately, it\\'s not lost. The IRS allows you to first carry the credit backward to your prior tax return, and then forward to future returns (up to 10 years). The ability to carry back or carry forward the unused tax credit only applies if you file Form 1116, and it is restricted by the amount of \"excess limit\" available in those years. The excess limit is created when the U.S. taxes on that foreign income are greater than the foreign taxes paid. For example, if you have $100 in unused foreign tax credits, first look at the prior tax year and then at the subsequent tax years to see if you have excess limit available. If you have excess limit in those years, you can use the foreign tax credit to reduce your tax bill on those returns (this requires filing an amended tax return for the prior year). Prior and Subsequent Tax Years US taxes on foreign income (A) Foreign taxes paid (B) Excess limit (A)-(B) Prior tax year $300 $250 $50 Subsequent tax year $325 $250 $75 In the example above, there is $50 of excess limit in the prior year and $75 of excess limit in the subsequent year. That means you can offset the $100 of unused foreign tax credits against the prior and subsequent returns, thereby reducing your taxes in those years, and still have $25 of excess limit to be used in the future. Form 1116 can be complex In most cases, you\\'re probably better off taking the credit rather than claiming an itemized deduction, even if the credit you claim is limited. However, one problem with taking the credit is that Form 1116 can be complex. Part of the reason the Form 1116 is complicated stems from the need to report the foreign taxes paid country by country. In addition, Form 1116 also requires you to figure the carryback or carryforward separately for each income category. Fortunately, if you pay $300 or less in foreign taxes for the year ($600 for married couples filing jointly), you can claim the credit without having to fill out Form 1116, although additional eligibility rules apply. For example, to claim the foreign tax credit without filing Form 1116, all of your foreign income must be passive and reported to you on a form like the 1099 or schedule K-1. For more information on calculating your allowable foreign tax credit, see Form 1116 instructions and IRS Publication 514. Foreign taxes in a tax-deferred account Unfortunately, you won\\'t be able to deduct foreign taxes you pay on investments held in a tax-deferred account, such as an individual retirement account (IRA) or 401(k). Since the income in those accounts is not currently subject to U.S. tax (at least not until you begin making withdrawals). But don\\'t worry—you don\\'t lose the benefit of the foreign taxes you paid in those accounts, because the foreign taxes reduce the income earned in that account. It\\'s like you are taking a deduction against the income, and when you eventually withdraw the money, you are only taxed on the net amount. It\\'s similar to taking an itemized deduction for the foreign taxes. If you have a Roth IRA, the situation is a bit different. Withdrawals from Roth accounts are not taxed by the IRS, so you\\'re not able to get a benefit from the foreign taxes you paid. But don\\'t let lack of tax benefit deter you from holding foreign investments in your Roth account; in some cases, it could still make sense to have foreign assets in those accounts. There are many other factors to consider apart from taxes when making investment decisions, such as diversification of your portfolio. Get the facts on FATCA and FBAR In order to prevent tax evasion, the U.S. government implemented Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and the Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) requirements. The reporting requirements created by these laws are complex, and there are significant penalties for failure to comply. If you hold a title, directly or indirectly, to a foreign financial account or trust, you should consult with a tax professional for questions about individual compliance matters. For more information on FATCA and FBAR, see the IRS resources below: FATCA for individuals FBAR Comparison of reporting requirements under FBAR and FATCA Take charge of your taxes Tax-smart financial planning has the potential to save you a lot of money in the long run. No matter how you choose to handle your foreign taxes (as a credit or a deduction), be sure to claim the option that makes the most sense for your situation. Otherwise, you could end up paying more than you should.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Flexible and visually intuitive to many traders, Bollinger Bands® can be a helpful technical analysis tool. Invented in 1983 by John Bollinger, they’re designed to help traders evaluate price action and a stock’s volatility. Before we get to how they can do that, let’s talk about what they are and what they look like. A Bollinger Band consists of a middle band (which is a moving average) and an upper and lower band. These upper and lower bands are set above and below the moving average by a certain number of standard deviations of price, thus incorporating volatility. The general principle is that by comparing a stock’s position relative to the bands, a trader may be able to determine if a stock’s price is relatively low or relatively high. Further, the width of the band can be an indicator of its volatility (narrower bands indicate less volatility while wider ones indicate higher volatility). Bollinger Bands typically use a 20-period moving average, where the “period” could be 5 minutes, an hour or a day. By default, the upper and lower bands are set two standard deviations above and below the moving average. However, traders can customize the number of periods in the moving average as well as the number of deviations. Figure 1: Bollinger Band activity over the course of 20 days. Using Bollinger Bands Before we discuss how to use Bollinger Bands, it’s important to note: When the price touches the upper band, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you should sell. Similarly, when the price touches the lower band, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should buy. In fact, take it from John Bollinger himself who said, “There is absolutely nothing about a tag of a band that in and of itself is a signal.” Prices can “walk the band” during a strong down- or uptrend. This means that there are repeated instances of a price touching or breaking through the lower or upper band. That’s why you may not want to take action when the price touches either band—you might, instead, prefer to wait and look for chart patterns like the “double bottom,” a “classic M top,” or a “three pushes to high” formation. Let’s talk about these chart patterns more: Double bottom A double bottom occurs when there is a fall in price, followed by a rise, followed by another fall that is close to the previous low, and finally another rise. To identify a double bottom, look for a price that has touched the lower band and wait to see where the next low occurs. A price that reacts and rises close to the middle band, followed by a second low inside the lower band, suggests that the price is positioned for an upward move—a good time for traders to buy. Without the Bollinger Band, the stock could look like it is trending down on the second low, especially if the second low is lower than the first. But with the Bollinger Band, the second low may indicate that the stock could be preparing for an uptrend. Figure 2: The double bottom on display. The classic M top The classic M top is formed by a push to a high, followed by sell-off reaction, and then a test of the previous high. The second high can be higher or lower than the first high. Watching the price behave like this, a trader may wonder if the stock is in a new uptrend, or if it has met its resistance. The Bollinger Band may help to answer this. In a classic M top, the first high either touches or is outside of the upper band, the price reacts by dropping close to the middle band (the moving average), and the second high touches inside the upper band. The second high can be higher or lower than the first high. The fact that the second high is within the upper band suggests that it is a lower high on a relative basis. For many traders, this second high signals a sell. Figure 3: This classic M top shows how a second high can be both higher than the first, yet still within the upper band. Three pushes to high A “three pushes to high” top often develops as a leading edge of a larger, longer topping formation. The way it forms is typically like this: The first push creates a new high outside the upper band; the second push makes a new high and touches the upper band; the third push makes a new high, but within the upper band. This scenario may be a reliable indicator of decreasing momentum. With it, you may notice there is also decreasing volume. Figure 4: With the first high above the upper band, the second high at it, and the third high beneath the upper band, the “three pushes to high” formation is complete. Signaling the starts or the ends of trends Bollinger Bands can also indicate the end of a strong trend. Strong trends, especially those developing after a breakout of a trading range, will result in an expansion in volatility that will cause the bands to initially move apart. This means that in a strong uptrend, the lower band will actually move downward in the opposite direction of the new trend. When the lower band turns back up, it can be a signal that the move higher might be over, at least for a while. Another interesting use of Bollinger Bands is based on the observation that volatility tends to be mean-reverting: Periods of low volatility are generally followed by high volatility and vice versa. Narrow bands indicate a squeeze, which means that volatility is low. But remember, since volatility is mean-reverting, the bands will probably expand, signaling a potential for an explosive move. A simple way to spot a squeeze is to identify when the bands are the narrowest they have been for the last six months. Figure 5: The Bollinger Band shows a squeeze, which could signal more volatility ahead. If you’re looking to go long when trading a squeeze, consider placing a buy entry point above the upper band. Once it’s executed, you could place an initial stop under the low of the breakout formation or under the lower band. If you’re shorting, you could place a short sell entry point below the lower band in the squeeze area and, once it’s executed, consider placing your initial stop over the high of the breakout formation or over the upper band. Remember to adjust your stop orders as needed, or consider using a trailing stop designated in either a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage. Another method would be to use the parabolic SAR indicator to trail your stop. Finally, to capture longer moves, you could consider exiting when the stock tags the opposite band (i.e., the lower band if you’re long, or the upper band if you’re short). Pair with other indicators Since Bollinger Bands are a pure price indicator, you might want to consider combining them with volume indicators for even more depth and insight. Ultimately, there’s no indicator that guarantees you’ll always get in at the bottom or out at the top. However, Bollinger Bands—especially when paired with other indicators such as chart pattern recognition tools—can help you make better trading decisions.'}],\n",

       "   'abstract': 'When looking for trade opportunities, be sure to check the income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows.',\n",
       "   'content': \"When the stock market boomed in the 1920s, investors essentially had to fly blind in deciding which companies were sound investments because, at the time, most businesses had no legal obligation to reveal their finances. After the 1929 market crash, the government enacted legislation to help prevent a repeat disaster. To this day these reforms require publicly traded companies to regularly disclose certain details about their operations and financial position. The income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows are required financial statements. These three statements are informative tools that traders can use to analyze a company’s financial strength and provide a quick picture of a company’s financial health and underlying value. This article will provide a quick overview of the information that you can glean from these important financial statements without requiring you to be an accounting expert. Statement #1: The income statement The income statement makes public the results of a company’s business operations for a particular quarter or year. Through the income statement, you can witness the inflow of new assets into a business and measure the outflows incurred to produce revenue. Profitability is measured by revenues (what a company is paid for the goods or services it provides) minus expenses (all the costs incurred to run the company) and taxes paid. The income statement is read from top to bottom, starting with revenues, sometimes called the “top line.” Expenses and costs are subtracted, followed by taxes. The end result is the company’s net income—or profit—before paying any dividends, and this is where the term “bottom line” comes from. Income statement example for YYZ Corp.* for the year ending Dec. 31, 2020 (in millions) * YYZ Corp. is a hypothetical example used for illustrative purposes only. As you can see in this example, net income declined from $75 million to $50 million. The next line in the income statement, after net income, displays the average number of common shares of the company’s stock that are held by investors. Next comes the firm’s earnings per share, which is calculated by dividing net income by the number of shares. Finally, the last line shows the dividends declared per common share, which is the cash payment per share (if any) the company makes to stockholders. The amount of any dividend payment is at the discretion of the company’s board of directors. Statement #2: The balance sheet While the income statement is a record of the funds flowing in and out of a company over a given time period, the consolidated balance sheet is a snapshot of a company’s financial position at a given point in time. In other words, the balance sheet shows what a company owns (assets) and owes (liabilities) and the difference between the two (stockholders' equity). This difference represents the book value of the stockholders’ stake in the company. It’s called a balance sheet because both sides of the equation must balance: assets equal liabilities plus stockholders’ equity. The balance sheet displays: The portion of those assets financed with debt (liability) The portion of equity (retained earnings and stock shares) Assets listed in order from most liquid to least liquid (in other words, assets that can be most quickly converted to cash are listed first) Liabilities listed in order of immediacy (those that have the most senior claim on a firm’s assets are listed first) Balance sheet example for YYZ Corp. for the year ending Dec. 31, 2020 (in millions) The amount by which assets exceed liabilities is listed as total shareholders’ equity, and this represents the net worth of a company, or the book value of the stock. Shareholders’ equity includes common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. Statement #3: The statement of cash flows As with an income statement, the statement of cash flows reflects a company’s financial activity over a period of time. It shows where a company’s cash comes from and how it’s used to pay for operations and/or to invest in the future. By showing how a company has managed the inflow and outflow of cash, the statement of cash flows may paint a more complete picture of a company’s liquidity (the ability to pay bills and creditors and fund future growth) than the income statement or the balance sheet. Statement of cash flows example for YYZ Corp. for the year ending Dec. 31, 2020 (in millions) Cash flow from operations Income and expenses on the income statement are recorded when a company earns revenue or incurs expenses, not necessarily when cash is received or paid. Similarly, the depreciation of owned assets is added back to net income, as this expense is not a cash outflow. Analysts often look to cash flow from operations as the most important measure of performance, as it’s the most transparent way to gauge the health of the underlying business. A decrease in cash flow due to a sharp increase in inventory or receivables can signal that a company is having trouble selling products or collecting money from customers. Cash flow from investing and financing Cash flow from investing includes cash received from or used for investing activities, such as buying stock in other companies or purchasing additional property or equipment. Cash flow from financing activities includes cash received from borrowing money or issuing stock, and cash spent to repay loans. Measuring a company’s financial strength The stock price for a given company can advance or decline based on a wide variety of factors. However, companies that perform well financially by increasing their earnings, net worth and cash flow are typically rewarded with a higher stock price over time. When it comes to trading, knowledge is power. Even traders who generally rely on technical factors to make their trading decisions may benefit from learning to use standard financial statements to hone in on companies that are experiencing strong or improving fundamentals.\"},\n",

Together both sessions are referred to as extended-hours trading. How does it work? Extended-hours trading is made possible by computerized order matching systems called electronic markets. An electronic market is simply a service that matches up buy and sell orders. For example, if you place an order to buy 200 shares at $45, the computer looks to see if there is an order to sell at least 200 shares at $45. If there is, the trade is done, if not, then the order will not be filled. At Schwab, clients can place orders for after-market trading and execution between 4:05 and 8 p.m. ET. Commissions and settlement times are the same as for the regular session. There are, though, several differences between regular session trading and after-hours trading. For example, in the after-hours session, not all order types are accepted. Traders can only use limit orders to buy, sell, or short. Stop and stop-limit orders, and orders with special conditions such as fill-or-kill, immediate-or-cancel, or all-or-none, can't be placed. Also, after-hours orders are only good for the particular session in which they are placed and do not carry over into any other session. What are some of the advantages of after-hours trading? There are several potential benefits for after-hours trading: Convenience: Some traders simply aren't able to place trades during the normal session due to their schedules. The after-hours session allows them to check out the current quotes and potentially place a trade at a more convenient time. Ability to react to news events: Many companies release earnings after the close of the regular session. After-hours traders can immediately place trades to manage their positions without having to wait until the next day's open and potentially miss meaningful price swings. The example below shows Intel Corp (INTC) making a big move after hours after releasing their earnings report. Source: StreetSmart Edge®.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Are there any risks? While trading in the after-hours session can offer opportunities, there are unique risks to be considered. Uncertain prices: In the regular session, the quotes you see are consolidated and represent the best available prices across all trading venues. In the after-hours market, on the other hand, you may only see prices from one venue, and these may not reflect the prices displayed in other electronic trading systems for the same security. Lower liquidity: Because generally fewer shares trade after hours, there can be wide spreads between the bid (the highest price offered by all buyers) and the ask (the lowest price offered by all sellers). Some stocks may simply not trade after hours. Lack of calculation of index values: For traders dealing with certain index-based products, the lack of calculation or dissemination of index values in the after-market could put an individual investor at a disadvantage to those professionals who have access to proprietary systems that can quickly calculate index values based on individual stock prices. The decision to trade after hours depends, of course, on your investment goals, trading style, and risk tolerance. While trading in the extended sessions is not for everybody, for those traders who understand both the potential risks and opportunities, it is certainly an avenue to explore.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My boyfriend and I just got engaged. While we agree on most things, we seem to have a lot of differences when it comes to handling money and have had several arguments about it. How can we keep this from becoming an ongoing problem? —A Reader Dear Reader, \"How to avoid fighting about money\" should be a required class for every couple. No matter how close you are, money differences have a way of creeping into—and causing problems in—the best of relationships. While there\\'s no lack of studies on money problems as a major cause of disagreement and conflict, the reasons for those problems can be as varied as the couples themselves. But while the particular reasons you and your fiancé argue about money may be unique to the two of you, there are some common ground rules that any couple can use to help work out their differences and develop mutual trust. 5 ways to keep a money problem from getting out of hand Ready to duke it out? Take a deep breath and do the following instead: 1) Choose a safe time and place to talk. Don\\'t try to solve the problem while one of you is running out the door or trying to chill after a long work day. Make a date to sit down together in a comfortable environment where you have the time to thoughtfully share your worries and wishes. Each of you should have an equal chance to make your case. Can\\'t come to an agreement right away? Take a break, then come back to the table and try again. 2) Understand that it\\'s often about more than just money. It\\'s about hopes, fears, childhood experiences and the values we learned from our parents. So you have to go deep and ask each other—and yourself—questions to get at what\\'s really behind your money differences. Chances are the real cause of your disagreement lies in what money means to you. To some, money represents self-worth; to others control. If it\\'s a control issue, confront that now, or it could lead to serious problems and even financial abuse later. 3) Avoid the blame game. In a long-term relationship, it\\'s tempting to use ancient history to support your side. Don\\'t. Rather than make accusations, look for areas of understanding. Whether it\\'s about an extravagant purchase, a large debt or someone dropping the ball, pointing fingers won\\'t solve the problem. Whoever is the \"guilty party\" will appreciate being given some slack—and be more open to finding a solution. 4) Stick to the facts. It\\'s human nature to dwell on \"what ifs.\" But no matter how dire the situation could have been, deal only with the real problem at hand. If, for instance, you\\'re arguing about a late bill payment, figure out how to handle that specific issue rather than worry about the imagined consequences of a pile of hypothetical unpaid bills. 5) Be willing to listen—and negotiate. Just as there are two sides to every problem, there are usually two (or more) ways to find a solution. The ideal is to meet in the middle. To do that, you first have to listen to each other\\'s side. Not only listen, but really hear. A good technique is to restate what you\\'ve just heard to make sure you got it right. Ask clarifying questions. And definitely avoid inflammatory language. There\\'s no positive outcome to calling someone a spendthrift or a killjoy. Most importantly, realize that \"negotiate\" and \"compromise\" are your guiding principles—and the fairest way to find a mutually satisfactory solution. 5 more ways to keep it from happening again and again Successfully dealing with a specific money problem is a good first step. However, to help keep these types of problems from constantly recurring, you need to look at the big picture—and agree on certain parameters. Here are five more \"rules of engagement\" that can help you long after you\\'ve walked down the aisle: 6) Address problems sooner rather than later. If you let things build up, they\\'re more likely to blow up. Agree to talk things out as soon as either of you has a concern. 7) Acknowledge each other’s strengths, weaknesses and differences. Maybe one of you is a saver and the other a spender. Or maybe you have different levels of interest or financial know-how. That\\'s okay. Figure out how you can complement each other. It\\'s fine to designate different financial roles and responsibilities that play to your individual strengths as long as you both understand the big picture and participate in major decisions. And along the way, the less involved partner might become more engaged! 8) Give each other some space. Togetherness is important, but when it comes to money, a little independence can go a long way in keeping the peace. I like a yours, mine, ours approach where each partner contributes to a joint household account but also has a separate account with a certain amount of discretionary money to budget and spend as they wish. That way you can hopefully avoid judgments about spending decisions—as well as deception. 9) Prioritize financial goals together. You\\'re bound to have individual as well as mutual financial goals. Be realistic about the best way to achieve them, separately and together. Perhaps you can each contribute to your own as well as to your mutual goals. Or maybe you\\'ll have to prioritize one over the other. Just make sure you agree on what you\\'ll do first so neither of you feels less important than the other. 10) Keep talking. You won\\'t solve all your money differences in one discussion. And no matter how successful you are at handling today\\'s issues, future misunderstandings are bound to happen. It\\'s often hard to talk about money, especially at first. But the more you do, the better you\\'ll get at it—and the better your relationship will be. I can tell you that from experience! All the best to you and your fiancé for a long, happy and financially rewarding life together. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'This is a new type of exchange-traded ETF that is built differently from a traditional ETF.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Everyone wants a safe and reliable vehicle. So, when buying a car, experts recommend that it's a good idea to pop the hood and take a look inside. What you see may tell you a lot about the vehicle's performance, cost and reliability for years to come. The same is true for active semi-transparent exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This is a new type of ETF that is built differently from a traditional ETF. Therefore, knowing what's under the hood is more important than ever. Most ETFs on the road today are based on the '40 Act fund chassis (referring to the Investment Company Act of 1940). This means that they're basically structured in the same way that traditional mutual funds are structured, but their sponsors have received permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to do things a little differently. For example, traditional '40 Act mutual funds buy and sell shares at the end of each trading day, with investors of all sizes, at the fund's net asset value (NAV). ETFs, on the other hand, have received permission from the SEC to transact only with large authorized participants (APs) in big bundles of shares (typically 50,000). Another difference between ETFs and mutual funds is the frequency of portfolio disclosure. While mutual funds typically disclose their holdings either monthly or quarterly with a significant lag (up to 60 days), most ETFs disclose complete holdings information every day the markets are open.1 Historically, most ETFs have operated with similar exemptions from the Investment Company Act of 1940, but new types of ETF structures began receiving approval from the SEC in 2019. These new ETF models are frequently referred to as “active semi-transparent,” and the first ETFs based on these models were launched in 2020. Although the details vary, the purpose behind all of these new models is to make ETFs friendlier to active managers by removing the daily disclosure of holdings. For years, active managers have largely avoided ETFs,2 because they've been worried that providing daily, full disclosure would allow traders to front-run their trades and competitors to steal their “secret sauce.” However, daily disclosure has been a very important component of ETF mechanics. Knowing exactly what's inside an ETF allows market makers and APs to efficiently value the portfolio and (for most large, liquid ETFs) they tend to conduct trades that keep the ETF's price generally in line with its underlying value. Because completely transparent, daily disclosure of holdings doesn't come standard, active semi-transparent ETFs must offer a package of other features to keep the fund trading smoothly. For example, Precidian's ActiveShares structure uses an additional intermediary to facilitate creations and redemptions. Sort of like APs for the APs, authorized participant representatives (APRs) are the only entities outside of the fund sponsor to know precisely what's inside the portfolio.3 When an AP wants to create shares, the AP contacts an APR, who buys the stocks in the creation basket on their behalf within a confidential account and delivers those securities to the ETF's manager in-kind. In return, the ETF manager delivers ETF shares, which the APR passes back to the AP. Conversely, when an AP requests a redemption, the APR receives the ETF's redemption basket (underlying securities) from the fund sponsor, sells the securities within the confidential account, and then delivers the proceeds to the AP. In either case, the AP does not know exactly which stocks were bought or sold on their behalf.4 To help APs manage this new creation/redemption process, the ActiveShares model provides more frequent snapshots of a fund's value. Currently, the intraday indicative value (IIV) is calculated by exchanges for traditional ETFs every 15 seconds,5 while ETFs based on Precidian's ActiveShares structure provide a real-time snapshot every second.6 The SEC has also approved other active semi-transparent ETF models, which don't employ additional intermediaries, but instead rely on creation/redemption baskets that are slightly different from a fund's actual holdings. These proxy portfolios may include decoy securities and/or alternative weighting schemes, and they are frequently generated with the assistance of computer programs (typically described as algorithms or mathematical optimizations). Because APs may not be able to use their current tools to efficiently value ETFs and trade them smoothly, and many of the new models appear to depend on a level of trust developing between the entities involved (APs, APRs, fund sponsors, etc.), it's possible that transaction costs for active semi-transparent ETFs could be higher than for traditional ETFs, at least initially.7,8 However, based on their limited track records so far, semi-transparent ETFs appear to be trading in line with other ETFs in the same asset class and with similar fund sizes. Furthermore, tax efficiency could be a concern for models that rely on proxy portfolios, since the ETF's manager will have to buy and sell securities to better align the securities they receive through creation/redemption baskets with the securities they actually want to own. Potentially, this could reduce the tax efficiency of active-semi-transparent ETFs compared to traditional ETFs and possibly create a drag on performance. However, for 2020, capital gains distributions (which result from sales made by the fund) were limited, with only one semi-transparent ETF distributing capital gains. Nevertheless, the range of investment strategies employed by active semi-transparent ETFs is limited (at least initially), as the securities eligible for inclusion must be U.S. exchange-listed and trade during U.S. market hours. Finally, while active semi-transparent ETFs may provide advantages compared to traditional mutual funds, it's important to remember that none of the new models have been truly crash-tested. Simulating a market environment that suddenly becomes irrationally volatile or where liquidity quickly dries up just isn't possible for new financial products in the same way that simulating a wet or icy road is for vehicles. As a result, we believe that active semi-transparent ETFs are an interesting development, but until these funds have a longer track record, most investors should proceed with caution. A hybrid approach to investing: A hybrid approach to investing Mutual Funds Traditional ETFs Active Semi-Transparent ETFs What is it? > Mutual Funds An investment vehicle typically based on the Investment Company Act of 1940 that allows investors to pool assets and collectively purchase stocks, bonds or other securities.Mutual funds are either actively managed (investment decisions are based on the analysis of a single individual or investment team) or passively managed (the fund attempts to replicate a published index).Mutual funds typically disclose their holdings monthly or quarterly. > Traditional ETFs Also based on the Investment Company Act of 1940 (typically), but with significant exceptions to certain rules. For example, ETFs have received permission from the SEC to transact only with large authorized participants (or APs) in big bundles of shares (typically 50,000). Most ETFs disclose the holdings in their portfolios each day.While most traditional ETFs are passively managed, there are some actively managed ETFs as well. > Active Semi-Transparent ETFs New fund structures with additional differences vs. the Investment Company Act of 1940.Although the details and mechanics of each new structure vary, the purpose behind all of them is to make ETFs more attractive to active managers by not revealing their funds’ full, underlying holdings on a daily basis to market participants who may abuse such information. > Creation/redemption of shares > Mutual Funds Investors buy or sell shares directly from the fund company (or through an intermediary, such as Schwab). Shares are created when the fund company receives investors’ cash and issues shares to the investor at a price called the Net Asset Value (or NAV). The NAV is the end-of-day value of all the fund’s assets minus its liabilities. All investors buying or selling on the same day receive the same NAV price. > Traditional ETFs Only APs are able to transact directly with the fund company. Investors buy and sell shares from APs (and other market participants) on national stock exchanges throughout the trading day at prices which may differ from NAV. Furthermore, most ETFs are created/redeemed “in-kind.” To create shares, APs must deliver the securities comprising the fund’s portfolio to the fund’s sponsor in exchange for ETF shares. To redeem shares, APs deliver ETF shares to the fund sponsor and receive the fund’s underlying holdings in return. > Active Semi-Transparent ETFs Creation/redemption processes vary based on the exact terms of the new structure; numerous structures have been proposed to the SEC and several have received SEC approval. In most of the new structures, the AP creates/redeems shares via a proxy portfolio (i.e., it delivers or receives securities that are not exactly the same as those actually held by the fund).However, in one structure, the creation basket contains the same holdings as the fund, but there is an additional intermediary between the fund sponsor and the AP. > Disclosure of full portfolio with actual holdings > Mutual Funds Either monthly or quarterly with a lag > Traditional ETFs Typically daily > Active Semi-Transparent ETFs Either monthly or quarterly with a lag > Intraday calculation of portfolio value > Mutual Funds Not available > Traditional ETFs Typically available every 15 seconds; based on actual ETF holdingsHowever, dissemination of intraday portfolio value is not required by the SEC’s 2019 ETF Rule. So, this practice may be discontinued for at least some (and perhaps many) ETFs.9 > Active Semi-Transparent ETFs Various structures offer different calculation frequencies and are based on either the actual portfolio or a similar, proxy portfolio. > Trading > Mutual Funds Shares are bought and sold at end of day net asset value (NAV) directly with a fund sponsor. > Traditional ETFs Shares are bought and sold on exchanges at market prices throughout the trading day. > Active Semi-Transparent ETFs Shares are bought and sold on exchanges at market prices throughout the trading day. Because market makers and APs may be less able to accurately value the underlying holdings, shares may trade with wider bid-ask spreads and bigger premiums/discounts compared to traditional ETFs. However, trading to date has been in line with other ETFs in the same asset class and with similar fund sizes. > Portfolio Management > Mutual Funds Portfolio managers may create capital gains when they buy or sell shares inside the portfolio to accommodate investors’ cash flows. This can lead to lower tax efficiency. Alternatively, holding cash to facilitate flows may reduce performance compared to a fully invested portfolio. > Traditional ETFs May use the creation/redemption process to remove lower-cost basis shares from the portfolio, which could increase tax efficiency. Cash drag is marginal due to receiving and distributing shares primarily in-kind. > Active Semi-Transparent ETFs May use the creation/redemption process to remove lower-cost basis shares from the portfolio, which could increase tax efficiency. Cash drag is marginal due to receiving and distributing shares primarily in-kind. However, for structures which rely on proxy portfolios, managers will have to buy and sell securities to better align the securities they receive through creation/redemption baskets with the securities they actually want to own. This could reduce the tax efficiency of active semi-transparent ETFs compared to traditional ETFs and possibly create a drag on performance. > Expense ratios > Mutual Funds Net expense ratios tend to be higher than ETFs, especially for actively managed mutual funds, which require research teams and tools (data packages, technology tools, etc.). > Traditional ETFs Net expense ratios tend to be lower, especially for funds tracking standard indexes in easy to access asset classes (e.g. U.S. large cap equities). > Active Semi-Transparent ETFs Net expense ratios tend to be higher, since these types of ETFs also require research teams and tools (data packages, technology tools, etc.). However, the expense ratios for the active semi-transparent ETFs which have launched are on par with the lowest cost share classes of similar funds offered by the same fund sponsor (the lowest cost share classes are often referred to as “institutional share classes”). > 1 Final Rule: Shareholder Reports and Quarterly Portfolio Disclosure of Registered Management Investment Companies, US Securities and Exchange Commission, February 27, 2004 2 Nate Geraci, “Can Nontransparent ETFs Save Active Mgmt?” ETF.com, June 13, 2019 3 “Precidian Comments on U.S. SEC Approval of ActiveShares™,” Legg Mason, Inc. press release, April 8, 2019 4 SEC File No. 812-14405, dated April 4, 2019 5 Kramer, N., and Kayl, C., “Non-Transparent Exchange Traded Products: A Revolution 25 Years in the Making,” ALPS Inc., October 31, 2019 6 SEC File No. 812-14405, dated April 4, 2019 7 DaveNadig, “The 6 Year Active ETF Solution,” ETF Report, July 15, 2019 8 Diana E.

Active semi-transparent ETFs operate differently from other exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Unlike other ETFs, an active semi-transparent ETF does not publicly disclose its entire portfolio composition each business day, which may affect the price at which shares of the ETF trade in the secondary market. Active semi-transparent ETFs have limited public trading history. There can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop, be maintained or operate as intended. There is a risk that the market price of an active semi-transparent ETF may vary significantly from the ETF’s net asset value and that its shares may trade at a wider bid/ask spread and, therefore, cost investors more to trade than shares of other ETFs. These risks are heightened during periods of market disruption or volatility. Schwab receives remuneration from active semi-transparent ETFs or their sponsors for platform support and technology, shareholder communications, reporting, and similar administrative services for active semi-transparent ETFs available at Schwab. This fee will vary, but typically is an asset-based fee of 0.10% per annum of the assets held at Schwab.

       "   'content': 'There are two key factors that influence a stock’s performance. The first is the profitability of the underlying company. The second is how investors value that profitability. An earnings report can tell you something about how well the business is performing, however, it does not tell you anything about investors’ perceptions regarding the company’s performance. One way to measure this is the price-to-earnings ratio (or P/E for short). Components of P/E ratio The P/E for a stock is computed by dividing the price of the stock by the company’s annual earnings per share. If a stock is trading at $20 per share and its earnings per share are $1, then the stock has a P/E of 20 ($20 / $1). Likewise, if a stock is trading at $20 a share and its earning per share are $2, then the stock is said to be trading at a P/E of 10 ($20/$2). Enthusiasm on the part of investors can lead to “P/E Expansion,” while a lack of enthusiasm on the part of investors can result in “P/E Contraction.” P/E Expansion refers to a period when investors’ perceptions improve, and as a result, they are willing to pay more for a dollar’s worth of earnings. P/E Contraction refers to a period when investors’ perceptions worsen, and as a result they are willing to pay less for a dollar’s worth of earnings. For example, if the average P/E ratio for stocks overall rises from 16 to 20, while overall earnings remain relatively unchanged, this is an example of “P/E Expansion.” What traders look for Different companies and different industry groups can be awarded very different P/E ratios even if they are generating the same level of profit per share. In other words, two companies may both report earnings of $1 per share, but one stock will trade at $20 a share while the other trades at $30 a share. This can be due in part to the consistency of earnings, the anticipation for future increases in earnings and the industry group that each stock is in. If investors are excited about the prospects for a given company, they may be willing to accept a higher P/E ratio in order to buy its shares. On the other end of the spectrum, if investors feel that future earnings will be underwhelming, its P/E ratio may languish at a relatively low level. The key thing to look for is whether the current P/E for the stock of a given company is presently “high” or “low.” The tricky part is that there are arbitrary cutoff levels that qualify as “high” or “low.” The best way to assess a company’s P/E is by: Comparing the current P/E to the history of the company’s own P/E range. If appropriate, comparing the company’s current P/E to that of other similar companies (i.e., other companies in the same business or industry group). In general, if the current P/E is at the lower end of a company’s own historical P/E range, or if the company’s current P/E is below the average P/E of similar companies, it may be a sign that regardless of recent business performance, the stock may be undervalued. What traders look out for The best-case scenario for any stock is for the underlying company to consistently grow its earnings, for investors to become enthusiastic about the company’s long-term prospects and to value its earnings at a high level–i.e., with an above average P/E ratio. That being said, emotional buying and selling at the extremes can force stocks into overbought or oversold levels. On the down side, a stock can become relatively “cheap” based on its P/E ratio. And while it may or may not represent an excellent value at that price, the stock may not rebound in any meaningful way until investors perceive there to be some catalyst. In addition, there can be situations where a company has a low P/E ratio simply because its future earnings prospects are dim. This can create a “value trap,” where a stock looks cheap by comparison but demonstrates in the future that there was a reason it was cheap. As a stock’s price rises, investors need to pay close attention when a stock gets bid up to an excessively high P/E level. In the heat of a bull market it is not uncommon to find “hot” stocks trading at a P/E of 50 or more. While this can go on for some time, eventually the stock’s price may drop. And when a “hot stock” falls out of favor, the ensuing price decline can be swift and painful. Stock analysis using the P/E ratio The P/E ratio can tell you a great deal about what investors overall think of a given stock. However, to accurately assess whether a stock is relatively overvalued or relatively undervalued, it is necessary to compare the current P/E to previous P/E ratios as well as P/E ratios of other companies in the same industry. Likewise, while exceptionally low or high P/E ratios can highlight potential opportunity or potential danger, stocks can sometimes continue to move to increasingly undervalued or overvalued levels for an extended period of time before things reverse.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I’m about to retire and have to decide between taking a lump sum or lifetime income payments for my pension. I’m leaning toward taking the lump sum. Is this a good idea? —A Reader Dear Reader, My first thought is to say congratulations! A pension in any form—whether taken as a lump sum or as lifetime income (sometimes called a pension annuity)—or some combination of both is a valuable and increasingly rare benefit. This is an important retirement decision. So my first piece of advice is to take your time and weigh all the options carefully. A lump sum can seem alluring, no doubt, but consider tax implications as well as potential benefits of spreading out payments over a longer period of time. I also want to point out that one choice isn't universally better than other options that may be available. The best choice for you will depend completely on your individual circumstances. Let’s take a look at some of what you need to consider before making this very important decision. Start by understanding the math As you start to do your analysis, it can be helpful to compare the raw numbers. As an example, let’s say you’re trying to decide between a $300,000 lump sum or lifetime income of $2,000 per month. This amounts to an annual return of 5.17 percent if you live another 20 years. In other words, if you were to take the lump sum and invest it on your own, you'd have to earn an average annual return of 5.17 percent to equal income of $2,000 per month for 20 years. However, this isn’t quite an apples-to-apples comparison. The lifetime income payments include a return of some of the original contributions along with investment returns. Additionally, it is guaranteeing you’ll receive the same amount of income if you live beyond 20 years. The 5.17 percent from investing the lump sum is a return on your money. Your actual investment results may wind up better or worse that this—with no guarantees. Complicating the analysis is whether income from your pension has a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), which can increase your payments to help keep up with inflation. This is a major factor because without a COLA you can lose considerable purchasing power over time. Your health and life expectancy are key Let’s continue with the example above. If you take the lump sum, the longer you live beyond 20 years, the higher your annual return will need to be to match the lifetime income payments. Conversely, the shorter your life, the more valuable the lump sum. Take an honest look at your health and family history of longevity before you make your decision. Think about the impact on your loved ones If you opt for lifetime income payments, you may have choices that would reduce your monthly payments but continue to pay lifetime income to your spouse or another survivor. A lump sum, on the other hand, could provide more flexibility or benefits for other beneficiaries. Consider the rest of your finances If you have considerable financial resources—brokerage, 401(k), IRA, business assets—and other sources of reliable monthly income (for example, Social Security or rental income) you may have less of a need for another source of lifetime income. Taking a lump sum could help you pay off debts. On the other hand, if you're concerned about covering your essential monthly expenses and like the idea of having a source of guaranteed monthly income, that could favor the annuity over a lump sum. Be honest about your investing skills, interest and desire for control Managing a lump sum takes skill and discipline. If you work with a financial advisor or are an experienced investor and are willing to put in the time, the lump sum could be a good fit—just make sure to consider fees. However, if you’re uncertain about your investment ability or would rather spend your time doing other things in retirement, lifetime income could be a better choice. Weigh your risks Either choice involves a certain degree of risk. If you choose a lump sum, your employer transfers all investment risk to you. You could do better—or worse—than the lifetime income option. Another concern is longevity risk, or the possibility that you'll overspend and run out of money. On the other hand, there are risks with choosing lifetime income—for example, dying prematurely, missing out on better investment returns or having the pension assets lose value if the plan isn’t adequately funded. The federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) provides a certain amount of protection for private pension participants; if you work in the public sector, your employer generally offers guarantees through the federal, state or municipal governments. Think about taxes If you take monthly income, your payments are subject to ordinary income tax. If you take a lump sum in cash, it's immediately taxable, and you’ll be subject to 20 percent federal (and potentially state) mandatory tax withholding. With a few exceptions, distributions taken prior to age 59½ are subject to a 10 percent IRS early withdrawal penalty. Withdrawals do not need to begin until age 72. Alternatively, you could likely rollover the lump sum into a traditional IRA or potentially into another employer plan and defer taxes until you take withdrawals in the future. You may have more than one option Sometimes you don’t have to make an all-or-nothing decision. Depending on your plan, you may be able to take a portion of your plan balance in a lump sum and the rest in a series of income payments. Other options might include starting the pension at a later date. Be sure you understand the details and how these arrangements would impact your total payout. As you can see, choosing between a lump sum and lifetime income payments is a complicated decision. As you weigh your options, it can be very helpful to consult with a trusted financial advisor. If you’re married, it’s also essential to consider your spouse. Your choice will impact both of you for many years, so take the time to make an informed decision. Whatever you decide, congratulations on your retirement. You’ve worked many years to earn your pension; now you get to enjoy its benefits. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'What the IRS rule on wash sales might mean for you.',\n",
       "   'content': 'The wash-sale rule was designed to prevent investors from selling a security at a loss so they can claim tax benefits, only to turn around and immediately buy the same security again. Even investors who have no intention of breaking this rule can get tripped up by it if they use an automatic investment strategy, such as reinvesting dividends, potentially costing themselves some tax benefits in the process. Here we\\'ll take a closer look at the wash-sale rule and answer some common questions about it. Q: I want to sell a stock to take a tax loss, but I plan to buy it again because I want it in my portfolio. What are the tax implications? If you want to sell a security at a loss and buy the same or a substantially identical security within 30 calendar days before or after the sale, the wash-sale rule will kick in. In such cases you won\\'t be able to take a loss for that security on your current-year tax return. Instead, you will have to add the loss to the cost basis of the replacement security. In addition, the holding period of the original security gets tacked onto to the holding period of the replacement security. Here\\'s an example of how this might work: Let\\'s say you buy 100 shares of XYZ stock for $10 per share ($1,000 of stock). One year later, the stock starts dropping, so you sell your 100 shares for $8 per share—a $200 loss. Three weeks later, XYZ is trading at $6 per share and you decide that price is too good to pass up, so you repurchase the 100 shares for $600. This triggers a wash sale. As a result, the $200 loss is disallowed as a deduction on your current-year tax return and added to the cost basis of the repurchased stock. That bumps the cost basis of your $600 of replacement stock up to $800, so if you later sell that stock for $1,000, your taxable gains will be $200 instead of $400. And because you previously held XYZ for a year, it will automatically be treated as a long-term capital gain, even if you sell it after just a few months. A few other things to note: A higher cost basis decreases the size of any future gains realized from the sale of the replacement security, thereby lowering your future tax obligation. If you sell the investment at a loss, the higher cost basis would actually increase the size of the loss for which you could claim a deduction. And one of the potential upsides of an extended holding period is that it would lower your tax obligation if you sold the replacement security after less than a year. (Normally, short-term capital gains from investments held for less than a year are taxed at the higher regular income tax rate, while longer-term capital gains are taxed at the lower capital gains rate). Q: What was Congress trying to accomplish with the wash-sale rule? Basically, the goal is to prevent people from selling securities for no other reason than to generate losses that could be used to reduce their taxable income. Before the law was in place, investors could sell a losing stock and then buy it again a minute later, effectively locking in a loss to reduce their taxes. Q: What if I wanted to sell a security to take a loss, but didn\\'t want to be out of the market for an entire month just to avoid the wash sales rule? What could I do? You could sell the security at a loss and the use the proceeds from that sale to purchase a similar —but not substantially identical—security that suits your asset allocation and long-term investment plan. Unfortunately, the government has not provided a straightforward definition of what it considers \"substantially identical.\" Investors will have to use their best judgment to avoid the wash-sale rules. Here\\'s an example of how the process would work. Let\\'s say you own an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is closely correlated to the S&P 500® Index and you end up selling that ETF at a loss. You could then use the proceeds from that sale to purchase a different ETF (or multiple ETFs) with similar but not identical assets, such as an ETF that tracks the Russell 1000® Index. By doing this you are able to take a loss on your current year tax return and still remain in the market with about the same asset allocation in your portfolio. The process of taking losses and finding other investments that meet your needs isn\\'t always easy. To successfully harvest a tax loss, you have to monitor your asset allocations, watch out for wash sales, and make sure that the replacement assets you buy aren\\'t substantially identical. Q: If I purchased and sold shares of a stock at a loss in one of my Schwab accounts and then repurchased them in another Schwab account, would I still trigger the wash-sale rule? Yes, wash-sale rules apply across all of your accounts, including those outside Schwab. In addition, wash-sale rules also apply to transactions in your spouse\\'s accounts. IRS regulations require only that Schwab track and report wash sales on the same CUSIP number (a unique nine-character identifier for a security) within the same account. Ultimately, each individual is responsible for tracking sales in their accounts (and their spouse\\'s accounts) to ensure they don\\'t have a wash sale. Q: Do the wash sale rules apply to ETFs, mutual funds and options? Yes, if the security has a CUSIP number, then it\\'s subject to wash-sale rules. In addition, selling a stock at a loss and then buying an option on that same stock will trigger the wash-sale rule. ETFs and mutual funds present investors a different set of challenges. Switching from one ETF to an identical ETF offered by another company could trigger a wash-sale. There are ways around this problem. For instance, an investor holding an ETF indexed to the S&P 500 at a loss might consider switching to an ETF or mutual fund that is indexed to a different set of securities, such as the Russell 1000 or Dow Jones Industrial Average. Q: What would happen if I sold a security at a loss in a taxable account and then immediately repurchased it in a retirement account, such as an IRA? The IRS has ruled (Rev. Rul. 2008-5) that when an individual sells a security at a loss and then repurchases that security in their (or their spouses\\') IRA within 30 days before or after the sale, that loss will be subject to the wash-sale rules. Q: Could I sell a security at a loss on Dec. 15, in order to squeeze it into the current tax year, and then repurchase the security on Jan. 4 without triggering a wash sale? No, the wash-sale rules are not confined to the calendar year. In this situation and your loss would be disallowed if you reacquired the security within 30 days.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Many people dislike thinking about taxes—so much that they ignore the topic until filing season is upon them. Unfortunately, waiting until the last minute to deal with tax matters can lead them to miss opportunities to potentially reduce their tax bill. Investors who include tax planning as part of their investing strategy could potentially see significant tax benefits over the long run, says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP® director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. You shouldn’t just be thinking about capital gains and losses. Savvy investors know how to manage the so-called “cost basis” and holding periods of their investments to help reduce gains that are subject to taxes. Knowing your cost basis can be a valuable tool. What is cost basis? Simply put, your cost basis is what you paid for an investment, including brokerage fees, “loads,” and any other trading cost—and it can be adjusted for corporate actions such as mergers, stock splits and dividend payments. This matters because your capital gain (or loss) will be the difference between the cost basis and the price at which you sell your securities. This cost is easy to calculate—if you don’t reinvest dividends or dollar-cost average when you invest. But if you buy over time, even automatically through a dividend reinvestment plan, each block of shares purchased is likely to have a different cost and holding period. Thus, you can pick and choose among the high- or low-cost, and long- or short-term, shares when you sell—and make the sale work to your best tax advantage. Alternatively, you can go with the automatic default method, which requires less effort on your part, but could cost you more in taxes. It’s also important to note that determining the cost basis for bonds can be a bit more complicated, based on whether you bought them at “par” (face value), paid a premium, or got a discount. Fortunately, bonds that are purchased from 2014 onward, are now required to have the brokerage firm provide each investor with tax documents that contain the cost basis for the asset. Reporting rules Federal tax rules require brokerage firms to report your cost basis to the IRS when you sell an investment only if that investment was purchased after one of the following dates: Equities (stocks, including real estate investment trusts, or REITs) acquired on or after January 1, 2011 Mutual funds, ETFs, and dividend reinvestment plans acquired on or after January 1, 2012 Other specified securities, including most fixed-income securities (generally bonds) and options acquired on or after January 1, 2014 Whether or not a brokerage reports your cost basis to the IRS, you’re responsible for reporting the correct amount when you file your taxes. And the cost basis method you choose to identify the shares you sell can make a big difference in the amount you end up paying. To understand why, you have to know a little about how the IRS looks at cost basis accounting. First In, First Out method The “first in, first out” (FIFO) cost basis method is Schwab’s default method for determining which assets were sold, for all investments other than mutual funds, if you don’t provide instructions to the contrary. If you purchased 1,000 shares over a number of years and you sold 100 of those shares, the FIFO method assumes that the shares you sold were the first ones purchased (the oldest shares). Generally, the shares you’ve held the longest are the ones you purchased at the lowest cost, which means the FIFO method could result in the largest gain recognized and the highest tax obligation. Specific identification method The other option with individual shares is called the “specific identification” method. The specific identification method takes a bit more effort, but it allows you to select the shares that are sold and gives you the most flexibility and potentially the lowest tax liability. Let’s look at an example of how specific identification works. Say you bought 500 shares of XYZ Corp. 10 years ago for $10 a share ($5,000 total), and you paid a $50 brokerage commission for a total cost of $5,050 ($10.10 a share). Several years later, you bought a second group of 500 shares for $60 a share ($30,000 total) and paid a commission of $10, for a total of $30,010 ($60.02 a share). Now, let’s say this stock has continued to appreciate in value, and each share is now worth $100. You want to liquidate 100 shares (assuming a $10 commission on the sale). Depending on which method you use, you could owe taxes on $8,980 in gains or on just $3,988 in gains. (See the table below for details.) Calculate cost with care to pay less tax Calculate cost with care to pay less tax By specifically identifying the shares you want to sell, in this hypothetical example, you would owe much less in capital gains tax. Comparison of capital gains calculated using “first in, first out” (FIFO) cost basis method and the specific identification cost Method Cost Proceeds Capital gain FIFO $1,010(100 shares x $10.10/share) $9,990 $8,980 Specific ID $6,002(100 shares x $60.02/share) $9,990 $3,988 Source Schwab Center for Financial Research. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. Identifying shares How do you identify the specific shares you want to sell? If you’re placing the order by phone, tell your broker which shares you want to sell (for example, “the shares I bought on July 5, 2012, for $11 each”). At Schwab, if you place the order online, you’ll see your cost basis method on the order entry screen. If you select the “specified lots” method, you’ll be able to specifically identify which lots you want to sell. Cost basis options for mutual funds Mutual fund investors have one additional cost basis method they can use called “average cost, single category.” This method determines your transaction’s cost basis by taking the average cost of all the shares you own and multiplying it by the number of shares you’re selling. This method provides the simplest way to handle mutual fund sales when you’re reinvesting dividends and/or regularly adding to your holdings. There is one major downside to using the average cost method. If you choose this method for your first sale, you must continue to use it for every subsequent sale for shares that were acquired before that sale date. Whereas, opting for specific identification would allow you to pick and choose which shares to sale, potentially saving you money. Say, for example, that you buy mutual fund shares each month through an automatic investment plan. One month the shares might be up; the next month they might be down. You pay little mind and just invest the same amount each month, a process called “dollar-cost averaging.” Let’s look at an example of how this works. Say you have 1,000 shares of a mutual fund and your lowest-cost shares were purchased for $10, your highest-cost shares were purchased for $100 and your average cost per share is $50. Today the market value of your mutual fund shares is $60, and you want to sell 100 shares. We’ll ignore commissions here to keep it simple. Let’s compare the three ways your cost basis could be calculated (FIFO, average cost, and specific identification) and see what the taxable gain is in each hypothetical scenario. Your cost basis can help you book a gain or loss Your cost basis can help you book a gain or loss Comparison of capital gain/loss among FIFO, average cost single category, and Specific ID methods Method Purchase price Sale price Capital gain/loss FIFO $10 $60 $5,000($50 x 100 shares) Average cost, single category $50* $60 $1,000 ($10 x 100 shares) Specific ID $100 $60 -$4,000(-$40 x 100 shares) Source Schwab Center for Financial Research. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. *The average price per fund share at time of sale As you can see in the table above, depending on the cost basis method you choose, your taxable gain or loss can vary greatly. Each of these transactions results in the same pre-tax cash flow of $6,000. However, depending on your particular situation, the money you have left in your pocket after taxes could be quite different in each method. So, which method should you choose? One cost basis method is not necessarily better than another since each has its benefits and down sides. Choosing the best cost basis method depends on your specific financial situation and needs. If you have modest holdings and don’t want to keep close track of when you bought and sold shares, using the average cost method with mutual fund sales and the FIFO method for your other investments is probably fine. But if you’re a tax-sensitive investor, specific identification could potentially save you a lot in taxes—especially if you use other tax-smart strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting, tax-gain harvesting, or donating appreciated assets to your favorite charity. Whichever method you decide to use, it’s important to plan ahead so you aren’t stuck with a huge tax bill come filing season.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Anyone watching the markets and reading the news recently is likely familiar with the term short squeeze—a trading phenomenon that can result in brutal consequences for anyone on the wrong side of the trade. The short squeeze explained The aim of short selling is to generate profit from a stock that declines in value. While there are potential benefits to going short, there are also plenty of risks. One big risk is when bullish news pushes the stock price higher, prompting short sellers to “head for the exits” all at once. As the shorts scramble to buy back and cover their losses, upward momentum can build on itself, causing the stock to move sharply higher. This is known as a short squeeze. What makes a short squeeze so dangerous? Think of it this way: When you buy a stock, the worst thing it can do is drop to zero. But the upside is unlimited. If a stock has a growth narrative and there are enough believers, the share price can go well beyond what looks reasonable by traditional fundamental metrics. Classic signs of a short squeeze can include: A dynamic narrative that tries to justify the detachment of share prices from a company’s intrinsic value A case for massive growth as well as for financial stress Traders with deep pockets aligned on both sides of the trade, often using options and other leveraged instruments With GameStop (GME) in 2021 and Tesla (TSLA) in 2020, there were many classic signs of a short squeeze. Traders with short positions were covering because they had to, either because they had sustained large losses, or shares were no longer available to be borrowed. When a stock suddenly experiences a dramatic climb, with or without good news, it’s important to ask yourself, “Who would buy shares up here?” The answer? Someone who doesn’t have enough money to hold on any longer, or someone whose pain threshold has finally been crossed. Proceed with caution If you’re a long-term investor who happens to own a stock that’s getting squeezed, it’s probably not a good time to trade. Instead of acting on emotions, remember what got you to where you are in your investing journey—and where you’d like to be. If participating in a stock that’s in squeeze territory doesn’t fall within your long-term objectives, you might want to step aside and not trade. If you do decide to venture in, make sure you have no illusions and no misconceptions of the dangers. Understand that when you’re dealing with a stock that’s being squeezed, you’re taking a big risk. Identifying a short squeeze can be relatively simple—after the fact. The trick is to identify the conditions that could lead to a squeeze ahead of time, and then determine how you might want to play it (or not). Shorting a stock is a complicated business. Because you can’t sell something you don’t own, shorting requires the seller to “borrow” the stock (and pay interest to the stock lender), then sell it. Locating the shares can sometimes be difficult for your clearing firm because of high demand or a small number of outstanding shares. Measuring a short squeeze can involve a metric called the short interest ratio, aka or “days to cover.” It indicates, in days, how long it would take to cover or buy back all the shorted shares. Basically, you divide the number of shares sold short by the average daily trading volume. The more days to cover, the more pronounced the effect can be. Consider the fundamentals If you’re buying a stock that seems to be in the throes of a short squeeze, especially at high levels, it helps to understand other potential reasons why the stock might be moving. Consider checking the fundamentals. Is there anything that would make you want to own the stock? Are you tempted to buy it because everyone else is? It’s important to always do your homework, and remember it’s never wise to go all in. A stock that’s in a short squeeze may still have a long way to climb, and if you don’t think the fundamentals support higher prices, then perhaps you should look elsewhere. In the case of TSLA in 2020, there were some positive fundamentals underlying the short squeeze, including the company’s more consistent profitability and hopes of it being included in the S&P 500 Index (SPX). The stock saw its share price run up to new highs, then decline nearly 60%. But then TSLA rallied again and split its shares, and its addition to the SPX became a reality, illustrating that a short squeeze doesn’t always have to end badly. Other stocks that were caught up in short squeezes haven’t always fared so well, in part because they didn’t have the fundamental support. Playing the squeeze? If you want to trade a stock during what might be a short squeeze, here are some things to consider: Trading such a stock may be okay as long as you understand the risk and how to control it. Whether you make small or large trades, you have to control and limit the risk. Decide how much money you would be comfortable losing in any trade ahead of time. Don’t underestimate how high the stock can go and how long it can take. When a stock gets caught up in a short squeeze, analysts generally expect it to correct eventually, but no one knows to what price and when; if it happens at all. The bottom line A short squeeze is a high risk situation and it may cause havoc in the market, but most don’t last forever. Most eventually subside.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie. My daughter is starting high school this year, and I’m worried about paying for college. I’ve saved some, but as a single mom, I’m afraid I just won’t be able to cover it all. Is there anything I can do to increase her chances of receiving financial aid? —A Reader Dear Reader, I’m glad you’re asking this question now while you still have several years to plan for college. As I’m sure you know, college can be expensive, but it\\'s also one of the best investments you can make in your daughter’s future—not only in terms of an education, but also for her career opportunities and lifetime earnings. You\\'re also smart to think ahead about financial aid because it\\'s such a powerful resource. In fact, the average award for a full-time student in 2018-19 was $15,210 per undergraduate student and $28,140 per graduate student. Here are some key steps you can take, starting now, to help get the most out of financial aid while at the same time potentially strengthening other aspects of your personal finances. Consider saving in a 529 In the next several years leading up to college, I encourage you to look into a 529 account, for a couple of reasons. Not only do they offer the potential for tax-free earnings for qualified higher education expenses, but the ownership rules are more favorable than for UTMA/UGMA when it comes to federal aid. Generally, 20 percent of a child\\'s assets and 5.6 percent of the parents\\' regular investment assets are used for evaluation. However, a child- or parent-owned 529 is considered owned by the parent and assessed at the 5.6 percent rate. Grandparent-owned 529 accounts aren’t included in the asset evaluation, but distributions may count depending on the year of withdrawal. Minimize parent and student income during key years Try to avoid large income spikes in the two years prior to applying for financial aid. This can distort your overall financial picture in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®). That\\'s because the FAFSA® considers income from \"prior-prior\" or last year’s tax filing (for example, if your daughter is going to school in the Fall of 2024, it will be based on your 2022 tax return). This isn’t to say you wouldn’t welcome a pay raise or bonus. But consider avoiding or minimizing high income from the sale of securities, large withdrawals from retirement plans, exercising stock options, etc. during these calculation years. Other potential strategies include managing financial gifts, deferring bonuses, or accelerating a sale of assets. For example, a financial gift to your daughter could be made to a 529. Bottom line, it\\'s smart to work with a tax and financial advisor before making any big financial moves. Fill out the FAFSA® The FAFSA® is the main gateway to most financial aid: grants, scholarships, work-study programs and tax benefits are aid sources you don’t have to pay back. Subsidized and unsubsidized student loans can bring down costs and provide additional funding, but unless forgiven, will need to be paid back. A common mistake is to incorrectly assume you won’t qualify for aid, so don’t fall into that trap—and don’t rule out schools with an expensive sticker price. Financial aid can help bridge the gap with schools you may think are out of reach. Colleges that admit you will use your FAFSA® to determine amounts and types of aid you\\'re eligible to receive. You\\'ll then need to contact the financial aid offices for specifics of applying for aid at those colleges. Don’t skip this key step. Moneythink has a cool new tool called DecidED to help students and families understand student financial aid award letters and assess factors like institutional outcomes and starting average salary. This helps you to know the true cost of your college options, evaluate and compare your choices, and make an informed—and affordable—enrollment decision that reduces the guesswork. Set yourself up for success Contrary to popular belief, having more debt doesn’t increase your chances of aid. Paying off your high-interest debt from taxable accounts can both reduce the amount of reportable assets you have and save you interest. Next, keep saving in your retirement accounts. Qualified retirement accounts like IRAs, 401(k)s, TSPs and 403(b)s aren’t reportable assets when applying for federal aid. On the other hand, consider avoiding buying annuities or life insurance products that are sometimes sold to “hide” assets. High fees, lack of liquidity and high complexity can make insurance products a poor solution. To me, insurance products should only be purchased if you need the insurance. Complete all financial aid applications on time, and update as needed Look out for federal, state and institution deadlines because they may all be different! And some financial aid is available on a first-come, first-served basis. It’s always wise to be an early bird. Also, don’t be reluctant to appeal your financial aid offers if your circumstances change. Divorce, death in the family, a job loss, or losses due to the pandemic or natural disasters can all impact eligibility, so in these cases reach out to the school’s financial aid officer. Don’t ignore small scholarships Winning a full-ride athletic or academic scholarship may be great, but in reality very few families pay for all of their college costs this way. Don’t overestimate your chance of winning a scholarship and neglect to save. But do keep in mind that scholarships come in all different shapes (including merit-based, academic, athletic and affinity groups) and sizes. Smaller or lesser known scholarships often go overlooked, but even small awards can add up! Double check GI Bill benefits This may not apply to your family, but it’s important for active duty/reservist service members and vets to know that the Post-9/11 GI Bill allows service members to transfer unused education benefits to certain family members. Recently, one of my colleagues realized he had 21 months that he could transfer to his spouse or child even after completing an undergraduate and an MBA degree! If you’ve earned this benefit, make sure you use it. As you look to the future, keep your eyes on the finish line. Save as much as you can, fill out the FAFSA® and pay attention to key steps, deadlines and planning considerations to maximize your chances. Best of luck on achieving what can be a life-changing journey for your daughter. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I’ve only been out on my own for a few years, and never paid much attention to insurance. But given all the crazy events of last year, I’m thinking I need to take it more seriously. Can you help me understand what kinds of insurance I need? —A Reader Dear Reader, This is a great question because insurance can be one of the most confusing areas of finance. This is also a very good time to be asking this question, given, as you mention, the extreme challenges we faced in 2020—from the pandemic, to hurricanes, to wildfires. To me, the lesson from these horrific events is that we always need to be prepared—not just for what we might be able to predict, but for the unexpected as well. That’s where insurance comes in—as a protection when life deals us a blow. Therefore, as confusing or expensive as insurance can seem, it’s absolutely critical to have the right kinds—and right amounts. In fact, not having the proper insurance can be much more expensive (and even calamitous) in the long run. Let’s take a closer look. Risk and insurance Before we get into the different types of insurance policies, it’s interesting to think about the different ways that we can manage risk—and how insurance fits in. In general, when it comes to any risk, there are four major approaches you can take. For example, if your risk is getting into a car accident, you could do one (or more) of the following: Avoid it. This may not always be possible. Strategy: Avoid driving. Reduce it. Minimize exposure to the risk. Strategy: Limit driving in bad weather, follow speed limits and obey traffic laws. Retain it. Be aware of and accept the risk. Strategy: Drive. Transfer or share it. Shift the risk. Strategy: Buy auto insurance. Use public transportation, ride-sharing, taxi. When you purchase an insurance policy, you're following strategy #4 by shifting risk to an insurance company. You're managing a risk that's difficult (or expensive) to avoid, reduce or retain. Insurance companies in turn manage these risks by pooling them together with lots of people. The economics work for them because there's a low probability that many people will face the same calamity at the same time. Some never will. Insurance helps you deal with unlikely but financially severe probabilities Insurance is designed to help protect you against low-probability, high-impact financial shocks. Think, for example, of how expensive it would be to cover the cost of a lengthy hospital stay completely out of your own pocket. Most people simply can’t save that much in an emergency fund. It’s impractical and not an efficient use of your money. On the other hand, it generally doesn’t make sense to insure high-probability, low-impact events because the cost often outweighs the potential benefit. For example, it's often more expensive to purchase a warranty than it is to replace a relatively inexpensive appliance. Different kinds of insurance can protect you in different ways There are all sorts of different insurance policies to protect you against different kinds of risks. Here are some of the most essential types and how they can fit into your financial plan: Health insurance can help reduce the costs of medical bills if you get sick. We all need this—no matter our age or current health. Life insurance helps protect your family if you die prematurely. It can also be used for business needs or more complex estate planning strategies. Disability insurance helps protect against the loss of income if you're unable to work. Most workers, especially those in their peak earning years, should consider this important coverage. Home, Auto and Renters insurance protect these items against damage or loss. Another must. Earthquake and flood policies provide protection against these risks. Umbrella and Errors and Omissions (E&O) policies can protect your assets and future income if you’re in a lawsuit. Whether you need these types of insurance is dependent on your individual circumstances. Annuities offer certain guarantees (backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company) that can protect against outliving your income, especially if you live a long time. Long-term care policies cover expenses associated with needing help with basic activities like eating, bathing and dressing or care in a nursing home. As you reach your 50s and early 60s, this can be a smart purchase. Buying insurance Whenever you buy an insurance policy, it's essential to do your homework and check out consumer resources. Work with an independent, knowledgeable professional who can explain features of individual policies and who understands your needs. Be aware of fees, commissions and any conflicts of interest. Avoid the temptation to simply purchase the cheapest policy. It may actually be more costly in the long run if the insurer can’t pay for claims or provides poor service. And finally, ask yourself the following as you go: What happens if I don’t have insurance and something bad happens? Are the risks temporary or permanent? Do I have enough in savings to cover the loss? Is it worth it to protect against this type of loss? How easily can I afford the premium? Your life changes—so should your insurance Be sure to review your insurance needs once a year or with any major life event like moving, getting married or divorced, or having a baby. Over time, with more savings and fewer debts, you may need less insurance. This can be in the form of lower coverage amounts or you may be able to afford higher deductibles, which can save you money. Don’t “set it and forget it” when it comes to insurance. Insurance sets up the foundation for your financial future One important lesson from the pandemic has been the need to be prepared for just about anything. As we look ahead into the future, it’s still smart to protect ourselves not only with an emergency fund, but also with ample insurance. Be smart and proactive as you do your research. As the years go by, you’ll be glad you did. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I\\'m fairly new to investing and want to choose companies that support causes I care about—like the environment. Is this a good idea? —A Reader Dear Reader, As Kermit the Frog says, it\\'s not easy being green. But for today\\'s investors, it\\'s easier than ever to invest green. That\\'s because increased awareness and socially focused investments are giving investors the opportunity to support causes that are important to them through their portfolios. And it\\'s not just the environment. Investors today can choose a wide variety of social issues to support—from clean technology to racial equity to gender diversity and more. And it\\'s an idea that\\'s gaining traction. Investing according to your values is broadly called socially responsible investing (SRI). You\\'ll also hear it referred to as environmental social governance (ESG), social choice, socially conscious investing, impact investing, and sustainable investing. For this column, I\\'m going to call it SRI. But what it\\'s called is less important than the fact that investors of all ages and economic levels, whether experienced or just starting out, can use SRI as a strategy to invest their money while making a positive difference. Here are some things to think about as you decide if this is the right approach for you. SRI goes beyond risk and return Traditionally, risk and return are key factors in choosing investments. And that still holds true for SRI. It\\'s just that with SRI, the idea is to choose investments based on whether or not they align with your beliefs and values, in addition to considering risk and return. So, you\\'re still sticking with the fundamentals of investing such as looking at your time horizon, how you feel about risk, asset allocation and diversification and your long-term financial goals. You\\'re just adding in another factor when considering which investments are right for you. You can be inclusive as well as exclusive In the past, the primary motivation of socially aware investors was often to avoid investing in companies that conflicted with their values. For instance, they might actively choose not to invest in areas like tobacco, gambling, firearms or alcohol. And that\\'s certainly one way to go. But now, many investors are also looking at what they can include in their portfolios. For example, they might want to target companies that fight climate change, preserve natural resources, provide opportunities for under-represented populations, or have strong employment and community practices. And the good news is that now it\\'s easier than ever to find such companies and support causes you care about with your investment dollars. Mutual funds and ETFs are a good way to get started While you could choose to invest in individual companies that support your specific causes, mutual funds and ETFs offer a low-cost and convenient way to create a diversified SRI portfolio. Today there are a variety of mutual funds and ETFs that align with specific interests, such as low carbon, gender diversity, good governance and more. There are also \"thematic\" funds that tend to focus on companies from a single industry that support a specific issue, so you can invest even more narrowly. Concerned with renewable energy? Chances are you can find a fund that invests in wind and solar companies. Want to support social equality? You might look for a fund that invests in minority-owned businesses. Performance and fees still play a part Doing good for others doesn\\'t mean you shouldn\\'t also look out for yourself. Bottom line, you still want to grow your portfolio. So you should approach SRI investments the same way you do any other type—with an eye on performance potential, costs and risk. One concern for SRI investors is whether they have to give up performance to achieve their social goals. So far, that\\'s not the case. While SRI funds don\\'t have a long history, current research has shown they\\'ve generally performed as well as non-SRI funds that don’t use any social screening and just focus on risk and return. Furthermore, costs are comparable. There are plenty of online research tools that let you compare expense ratios, performance benchmarks and risk measurements. As always, read a fund\\'s prospectus before investing. It doesn\\'t have to be all or nothing There are many levels of socially responsible investing. As you build your portfolio, it\\'s up to you whether you want all your investments to be SRI or just a portion. You might start by exploring SRI with one or two mutual funds or ETFs. As your assets grow or if you want to invest even more exclusively in the causes you support, you could work with a financial advisor who can help you target individual companies that reflect your beliefs. Or you could select an SRI portfolio of individual securities managed on your behalf by a professional asset management firm. Whatever your SRI goals or asset level, you have choices. For a lot of people, myself included, investing isn\\'t an end in itself but a means to an end. If that end for you is to make a positive difference in the world at the same time that you invest for your future, today\\'s SRI options give you a real chance to achieve it.

       "   'content': 'LIBOR is still being retired, just a little later than initially expected. LIBOR stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate, but in fact there are many LIBOR rates, spanning multiple currencies and multiple maturities. These rates are important for investors and consumer borrowers alike, as many loans are referenced to various LIBOR rates. In 2017, the regulatory agency that oversees LIBOR announced that the rates would be retired at the end of 2021. However, that deadline has mostly been pushed back. Most U.S. dollar-denominated LIBOR maturity tenors will continue to be published until June 30, 2023, but banks are still encouraged to stop entering into new contracts by that initial December 31, 2021 date. Below we’ll discuss the rationale, and what it means for investors. What happened? On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Association announced1 its intention to cease publication of two specific LIBOR rates while pushing back the timeline for LIBOR rates with other maturities: The one-week and two-month U.S. dollar-denominated (USD) LIBOR rates will retire on December 31, 2021. The overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month USD LIBOR rates will continue to be published through June 30, 2023. The extension of the various LIBOR maturities listed above is for legacy contracts or products only. A “legacy contract” is one that’s already been written with a LIBOR rate. After December 31, 2021, there should be no new LIBOR-based originations, even though the rate will likely be published into 2023 based on guidance from bank regulators. According to a joint statement2 from the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the “agencies encourage banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021, in order to facilitate an orderly—and safe and sound—LIBOR transition.” This announcement likely provides flexibility for many legacy LIBOR contracts. By pushing back the retirement date for many LIBOR tenors, this will allow many of these contracts to simply mature as scheduled, without having them be renegotiated and shifted to a new rate. This point was supported by Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randall Quarles’ testimony to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking on November 10, 2020. On the bright side, since the LIBOR retirement was initially announced, many LIBOR-based contracts continued to be written, but the contracts started using fallback language for when LIBOR was no longer a viable benchmark. The presence of the fallback language should help lead to an orderly transition for those LIBOR-based contracts once they do officially retire. What does this mean for investors? Three-month LIBOR is a common reference rate for many types of fixed income investments like floating-rate notes, preferred securities, and bank loans. While many of these investments have already have begun to switch over to different reference rates, like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), there are still plenty of investments that are still referencing LIBOR rates, and they might not have fallback language written into the prospectuses. If there’s uncertainty about what reference rate to use for a given security if its benchmark is no longer available, liquidity could dry up. Liquidity is the measure of how easily a security can be sold without incurring high transaction costs or a reduction in price. When there’s less liquidity for a given investment, the price at which the investment is sold might not reflect its true value. Investment-grade floating rate notes. Also called “floaters,” these are bonds issued by investment grade-rated corporations whose coupon rates “float” based on a short-term benchmark like three-month LIBOR. Floaters tend to have investment-grade credit ratings. This extension helps provide a more orderly transition for the investment-grade floating-rate note market. Investment-grade floaters tend to have relatively short-term maturities. By our calculations, roughly 74% of all outstanding floaters are scheduled to mature before June 30, 2023, but only 36% would mature before the end of 2021.3 In other words, allowing three-month LIBOR to continue to be published through June 30, 2023 allows most of the floater universe to mature before the benchmark disappears. Floaters that mature beyond June 20, 2023 and are referenced to LIBOR without explicit fallback language could face liquidity challenges, however. Investors who own individual floaters should be cognizant of what the reference rate is, and if it’s LIBOR, whether there’s explicit fallback language. Preferred securities. The transition away from LIBOR poses more of a challenge to the preferred securities market given their very long maturity dates, or no maturity dates at all. As a result, preferreds can’t necessarily navigate the transition by simply letting outstanding securities mature. Many recently issued floating- or variable-rate preferreds still use three-month LIBOR as a reference rate, but they generally have explicit fallback language in the case the rate is not available. Many seasoned preferreds—those that have been outstanding for years—likely do not have explicit fallback language and there’s plenty of ambiguity about what happens when the referenced benchmark rate is no longer available. Given this uncertainty, LIBOR-based preferred securities that don’t have explicit fallback language could be at risk of reduced liquidity. In the bond market, lower liquidity usually leads to a large gap between what a bond can be bought or sold for, and usually leads to more price volatility. This could negatively affect holders of these types of investments. Bank loans. Bank loans are niche investments that are generally held by institutional investors. Like investment-grade floaters, bank loans are generally short-term in nature, so many will mature before LIBOR is retired. Bank loans may also be called at the issuer’s option, so issuers can choose to retire them early. As they are generally institutional investments, it’s less cumbersome for the issuer to negotiate a change in the underlying benchmark, because they are dealing with a relatively small number of investors. Since individual investors can generally only invest in bank loans through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it’s up the fund managers to navigate these changing market conditions. The bottom line Pushing back the retirement date of key LIBOR rates will likely mitigate some of the negative consequences that might have occurred for many outstanding LIBOR contracts. But this extension of the retirement date doesn’t mean investors should be complacent now. Take this time to examine your individual holdings and figure out a plan, rather than waiting until we get closer to the actual retirement date. For ETF and mutual fund investors, it will be up to the funds’ managers to do their own due diligence on the underlying holdings. On the bright side, we have colleagues at Schwab who are looking into the LIBOR retirement and how various mutual funds and ETFs are navigating the transition.

       "   'abstract': 'Applying the Swedish concept of fartlek training to your finances just might get you to your long-term goal faster.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, Want to try something different in the New Year? How about fartlek training? It\\'s a pretty funny word for a serious way runners can train for a marathon. Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not suggesting we all become long-distance runners. In fact, I tried running for about a year and can\\'t say it was for me. But the concept of going the distance does resonate with my beliefs about saving and investing. You may have heard the analogy that investing is a marathon, not a sprint. And I certainly agree. But the problem with marathons for a lot of people is that they\\'re tiring and can seem daunting. A sprint is much more invigorating and doable by comparison. That\\'s where fartlek training comes in. Fartlek—a Swedish word meaning \"speed play\"—is a training method in which you vary the terrain and pace to decrease boredom and boost your psychological energy. It brings the thrill of a sprint into your run to increase your stamina and help improve your pace so you can reach your long-distance goal faster. So why not apply this idea to reaching your long-term financial goals? I think it could work—and be kind of fun. Boosting savings short-term can help you reach your long-term goal I always encourage a long-term view when it comes to saving and investing. Set a goal, save and invest steadily, and over time your chances of success are pretty good. At the same time, it\\'s kind of exciting to give your savings a boost when you can. For instance, let\\'s say you regularly save $50 a week. How about going for $100? It may sound impossible, but give it a try for 30 days. With some mindful budget trimming, you might find it\\'s easier than you think. Whether it’s not ordering out dinner for a month or cutting back on online shopping for a few weeks, try it. Maybe it’ll become a habit! Plus, use financial windfalls to speed things up even more. Did you get a bonus? Congratulations. Now put at least a portion of it towards your goal. A recent raise? Great. Up your 401(k) contribution. It’s exciting to see your balance go up in the short term—which might just give you the extra motivation you need to stay on a steady course for the long haul. And while you\\'re focusing on saving, don\\'t forget about using some of any extra money to pay down debt. Those constant monthly bills can really slow you down. Varying your pace keeps you going One of the reasons fartlek training works is that it\\'s free-form and flexible. You set your own sprint intervals, create individual interim distance markers, and are guided by your own circumstances. You choose what\\'s going to best motivate you at the time. I think that same approach can work for building your savings. For instance, maybe you\\'ve set a certain monthly savings rate for yourself. You\\'re doing well at keeping it up for several months or even years, but then something happens. A job change, an illness or an unforeseen event (we can certainly relate, having just made it through 2020!), and you have to pull back. Okay, change your pace. Prioritize your more pressing short-term needs while keeping at least a minimum aimed at your long-term goal. Then when things turn around again, maybe you can increase your savings rate for a certain period of time to get back on track. By varying your pace, you keep the discipline of saving while at the same time adjusting to your current circumstances. And when you\\'ve accomplished a burst of savings, you might even reward yourself after you\\'ve reached that next milestone. Remember, it\\'s your own personal race The thing about saving and investing is that it\\'s your own personal marathon. You\\'re not competing against anyone else. It doesn\\'t matter how fast someone else is saving, how aggressively they invest or what kind of returns they get. And it\\'s your own personal finish line. Others may be trying to time the market to get ahead faster, but don\\'t be tempted to follow them. Keep your eyes on your goals, set your own success markers, and have the confidence that you can keep going whatever the ups and downs. Will you have moments of doubt? Of course. When you need some encouragement or a little extra coaching to stay the course, consider checking in with a financial advisor who can help you refocus and recommit. A financial fartlek is easy to do and can help make up for lost time The idea of a financial fartlek might make you smile, but it can also be a great motivator. Slow and steady is a tried-and-true strategy, but changing things up, adding in short-term goal markers and picking up the savings pace now and then might just increase your stamina and get you to your financial goals even faster. If you were slow to start saving, increasing what you can sock away even for short intervals can help make up for lost time. And it\\'s totally within your control. If you can\\'t always hit your mark short-term, re-set your timing, slow down when you need to, and challenge yourself to accelerate your savings when you can. Running a marathon takes constant, steady discipline, but adding in a few sprints can make it more fun and more productive. Take that attitude toward reaching your New Year\\'s financial goals, and that finish line may be closer than you think. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'Raising a child is expensive. Here’s how to set financial goals for your child’s milestones while keeping your retirement savings on track.',\n",
       "   'content': \"For most new parents, focusing on the big picture isn’t easy. You’re sleep-deprived, juggling naps and feeding schedules, and excited about the new little person in your life. But milestones are on the horizon, and you’ll want to prepare for them while keeping your own finances on track. Here are six tips for new parents: 1. Consider insurance—both life and disability Adequate health insurance is crucial, but you’ll also want to consider life and disability insurance. Life insurance can pay for the things you’d like your family to have, such as a paid-off mortgage, school tuition, or a future wedding. Life insurance can help protect your growing family by making sure financial resources are available to them if you’re no longer there and can provide peace of mind for your partner and loved ones. Disability insurance can also be a major help if one or both parents becomes unable to work due to a disabling illness or injury. While you may have employer-provided disability insurance, make sure that it will be enough to cover essential expenses like your mortgage, debt, childcare, and household expenses for a reasonable length of time. You may want to consider supplementing your existing coverage with an individual policy or using an individual policy instead to provide more customized coverage for your needs. While you shop around, keep in mind that some policies may pay benefits only if you can't perform any work at all, rather than being unable to do the specific type of work you currently do. 2. Increase your emergency fund Having a child raises the stakes for “rainy day” planning. You’ll want to be sure you can keep your household running smoothly in the event of job loss, illness, or a large unexpected expense. As a rule of thumb, most financial experts recommend keeping three to six months’ worth of essential living expenses readily available for emergencies. This money doesn’t have to be in a single account, but can be spread between interest-bearing checking or money market accounts, certificates of deposit, short-term U.S. Treasuries, or other relatively conservative, liquid investments. 3. Take advantage of tax breaks For many working parents, childcare can be as expensive as a second car payment or mortgage. Fortunately, tax breaks can help. If you meet certain criteria, the Child and Dependent Care Credit can cover 20% to 35% of eligible expenses, depending on your income,1 with a limit of $3,000 for one child or $6,000 for two or more. A flexible spending account (FSA) is another option. This is an employer-sponsored program that allows you to set aside up to $5,000 per year tax-free for qualified childcare expenses for couples filing jointly with one or more dependents. You typically enroll in or renew your election in your Dependent Care FSA through your employer during your Open Enrollment period each year, but certain changes in status of “qualifying events” during the year -like having a new baby -allow you to make changes. Your human resources department or benefits administrator can tell you when employees in your organization can enroll in a Dependent Care FSA and help you get started. You can use the dependent care FSA to pay for eligible Pre-K childcare expenses tax-free including nursery school, pre-school, or similar programs below the level of kindergarten. Expenses to attend kindergarten or a higher grade aren't eligible FSA expenses, but down the road childcare, expenses for before- or after-school care of a child in kindergarten or a higher grade up to age 13 are eligible. The care provider just can’t be your spouse or another dependent child. Generally speaking, high-income families will benefit more from an FSA than from the Child and Dependent Care Credit (you can’t use both). A potential drawback is that the IRS requires money contributed to a FSA to be spent during the plan year (or a grace period extension). If the money isn’t used, it’s forfeited. Check with a tax advisor to see what works best for your situation or review IRS Publication 503 – Child and Dependent Health Care Expenses for more information. 4. Start saving for college now By the time a child born on January 1, 2021 packs his/her bags for college, four years of tuition and fees are projected to be roughly $243,000 at a public university (in-state resident).2 The earlier you begin saving, the better off you’ll be. For example, if you begin contributing $500 per month for college savings at birth, assuming a 5.14% rate of return, the amount would total about $216,000 by the time your child reaches age 18. If you postpone saving until your child is 10 years old, the final amount will be roughly $86,000. 5. Prioritize retirement savings If you must choose between saving for college and saving for retirement, choose retirement. Your child will likely have more than one way to pay for college—including scholarships, loans, and grants—but you can’t make up lost retirement savings. It’s great to care for your kids, but not if it means potentially burdening them financially for your care later on. 6. Update your estate planning documents One of the things that a will does is allow you to indicate who you would like to serve as guardian for your child if something happens and you’re not there. Have a conversation with an attorney to make sure other parts of your estate plan are in order, including powers of attorney for financial and health care decisions and up to date beneficiary designations. Your attorney can help you determine if setting up a trust makes sense for your situation and goals. 1 In 2019, filers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $15,000 or less qualified for the maximum benefit, while those with an AGI above $43,000 received the minimum.

       "   'abstract': 'Here are five common money missteps, and measures you can take to get back on track.',\n",
       "   'content': 'For many of us, managing our personal finances can be about as fun as doing our taxes. But just like software can make the tax process easier, there are specific things you can do to make money management as painless as possible. Below are five common money missteps and what you can do to get on track. 1. Delaying saving for retirement It’s easy to put off saving for retirement when you’re in your 20s—it seems far-off and making a day-to-day budget work may be challenging when you’re starting a career. Soon enough you reach your 30s, and your priorities may shift to saving for a house or paying for childcare—still not an easy time to save for retirement. The fact is, it may never be easy. But it will always be necessary. And yet, a quarter of American families don’t have any retirement accounts at all.1 The fix: As soon as you start a new job, sign up for your employer’s 401(k) plan. If your employer doesn’t offer a 401(k), set up an individual retirement account (IRA) and automate your monthly deposits. If you don’t get used to having extra money in your paycheck, you won’t miss it when it automatically goes into your retirement savings. Plus, if you start early, your earnings will have a chance to generate more earnings, growing your savings at an accelerated rate over time—that’s the power of compounding. 2. Skimping on an emergency fund Twenty-four percent of all Americans have no emergency savings set aside to cover home repairs, medical bills, temporary unemployment, or any number of unforeseen (and pricey) expenses. Close to 75% don’t have six months’ worth of expenses saved, and only one in five people have three to five months’ worth of expenses saved, according to an August 2020 Bankrate.com survey. The fix: Stash away three to six months’ worth of cash in a separate account to cover essential living expenses. The number may be daunting, but you don’t have to get there overnight. Funnel part of your paycheck automatically to a separate account and you’ll make steady progress over time. And remember to increase your savings rate as your earnings—and cost of living—go up. 3. Taking the short view on investing Given the bear markets earlier this year or from 2007 to 2009, it’s easy to understand why so many investors react rashly when the market takes a dive. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 20% of its value between February to March, and more than 50% from its peak in October 2007 to its lowest point in March 2009. But it’s the investors that have the fortitude to buy and hold who tend to prevail: The market has now generally recovered, and from that rock-bottom point in 2009, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen more than 20,000 points. Investors who cashed out earlier this year or back in 2009 may have locked in losses and consequently missed some or all the upswing. The fix: Stay invested. If you have a history of making investment transactions right after a major event, consider reducing the number of times you log in to view your account—say monthly or quarterly. Remember: Day-to-day market fluctuations have little impact on your long-term goals. Bear markets typically come to an end and research shows that staying invested over the long haul—and not trying to time swings—can be the best way to participate in the market. 4. Avoiding the market Market volatility may be scary, while past performance is not guarantee of future results, there has never been a 20-year period when stock returns were negative. Keep your time horizon in mind when you’re investing in stocks. Having most of your money in the stock market can be quite reasonable for a young person when investing for retirement. You should consider some exposure to stocks, even during retirement. The fix: You don’t have to jump in cold. Get in the habit of investing by moving a portion of your cash savings into a diversified portfolio each month. This approach, known as “dollar cost averaging,” ensures you buy more shares of an investment when the price is low and fewer shares when the price is high. If you have a significant amount of money to invest, dollar cost averaging will reduce the impact of market volatility on large purchases. 5. Concentrating your investments Some of us might have too much of one type of investment in our portfolio. Maybe it’s stock in the company we work at, or municipal bonds inherited from a relative. But there’s a benefit to owning many different types of investments. Having that variety in your portfolio—called diversification— tends to reduce its volatility and risk. Each investment responds differently to changes in the market or economy. If geopolitical events shake up your international stocks, for example, U.S. bonds might rise and help smooth out your portfolio’s return overall. The fix: Make sure that you have investments across numerous sectors, industries, and geographical areas. Once you have a diversified portfolio in place, revisit your portfolio’s allocation mix on a yearly basis to make sure it still aligns with your investment goals. 1Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Research and Statistics, “Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2019 – May 2020.” Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households (SHED), May 2020.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Talking with your family about financial challenges can lead to a more secure and emotionally closer New Year.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, If there’s one thing many of us are reluctant to talk about, it’s money. We might be comfortable sharing all sorts of personal information—about our health, our religious beliefs, even our personal relationships. But when it comes to our finances, we clam up. And this year that reluctance may be stronger than ever. If you’re one of the millions of Americans who has lost your job or your home and is struggling to make ends meet, money may be the last thing you want to discuss. Or if you believe that a loved one is worried about their finances, you might be hesitant to bring it up. Trust me, I get it. Even in good times, our finances can trigger all sorts of emotions, ranging from fear, to embarrassment, to guilt. Others may feel unprepared to deal with their money and therefore don’t discuss it. Or others may believe their personal finances are just that—personal—and not to be shared. The problem is that this reticence can work against us. The financial world has gotten so complex that we all need guidance and support from time to time. And this year in particular, we need each other more than ever. Therefore, this holiday season, my hope is that individuals and families across the country will initiate open, honest and respectful conversations about money. Spouses, children and parents, whether you're personally facing financial challenges or not, whether you’re concerned about a family member or not, I encourage you to share your thoughts, your knowledge, your wisdom and your encouragement. And especially if you’ve had a tough year, opening up can be particularly important. In so doing, you not only can pave the way for more economic security, but forge closer emotional ties as well. Some suggestions for getting started To be completely honest, talking about money can feel awkward at first, especially if you’re not used to it. If this is new for you, my first suggestion is to start with some introspection. Think about your own relationship to money. By nature, are you a spender or a saver? Are you cautious or more of a risk taker? Are you goal oriented? Are you a detail person or more interested in the big picture? All of these things will color the way you deal with money. My next piece of advice is to take it slow. When you approach a loved one, explain your intention, and set up a date and time to talk that will be convenient for everyone. That way no one will feel blindsided, and everyone will have the time to collect their thoughts. I’m reminded of this by a young colleague as she anticipated a visit from her age 70-something parents. Concerned about their finances, she gave them a heads-up that she wanted to set aside some time for a money talk. That way, her parents felt prepared and the three of them were able to have open and productive talks over the course of their time together. Not only did the parents agree to meet with a financial planner, but they were also able to open up about a host of other important issues with their daughter— from their delayed retirement to their estate plan. And perhaps best of all, the entire family can now face the future with a new confidence that they will discuss issues as they arise. Treat everyone with sensitivity and respect Whether you’re talking to a spouse, a sibling, a child, or a parent or grandparent, there are a few principles that remain constant. While many of them may seem obvious, they're easy to cast aside when emotions kick in. First, in money, as in life, there’s no place for deception. As much as you may want to paint a rosy picture or cover up some embarrassing details, it’s essential to face issues head-on and present them honestly. I recently wrote about the importance of being frank with your children, even when times are tough. Of course, the same goes for couples. We all know money can be a huge stress in a marriage, especially when money is tight. I’m a big believer that each spouse should have some financial autonomy at the same time that they share all of the big decisions. So, if you’re just starting out together, take the time to establish some guidelines and get on the same page financially. Or even if you’ve been married for years and avoided money conversations, it’s never too late to start. Think about it as an opportunity to share your values and work together towards a common goal. And finally, avoid the blame game. It’s fine to disagree, but listen carefully to the other person’s thoughts before you respond. Do your best to steer clear of hot buttons and stay positive and non-accusatory. Give each other the benefit of the doubt. Back up your discussions with sound information If in the course of your conversations you realize that you need more information before you commit to a course of action, that’s not only fine, it's advisable. Do your research and consider consulting with a trusted professional so you fully understand your options. Money conversations are hardly ever one and done. What’s important is that you start the process, remain guided by the facts and your goals, and commit to finding solutions. Looking to the new year I honestly can’t think of a time that has been as challenging as 2020-2021. My heart goes out to every person who has lost their home to a forest fire or a hurricane, their loved ones to the pandemic, or their business or job to the economic fallout. These catastrophes underscore the importance of our personal relationships. And my hope is that as we look to 2022, we will begin the process of healing by reaching out to all of the people we care about most. When we talk about money, we're really talking about much more. Money is nothing but a tool to allow us to follow our hearts and our dreams. Let’s start the new year by engaging in open, honest and respectful conversations about those hopes and dreams—and work together to make them a reality. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I just retired and am trying to figure out how to maximize all of my resources—Social Security, a small pension, as well as my investments. Given RMD's, taxes, etc. it feels overwhelming! Can you help? —A Reader Dear Reader, This is a great question because it's an essential issue for every retiree. After decades of receiving a regular paycheck, suddenly you’re faced with having to figure out the best way to pull money from your different accounts—whether that’s a 401(k), an IRA, or a regular investment account. On top of that you need to make decisions about Social Security and possibly a pension or annuity. Don’t get me wrong. Retirement can be a wonderful time to enjoy the freedom you've worked so many years to achieve. But as you make the transition from being a saver to a spender, chances are you'll have to manage your financial life even more carefully than in the past. Why? Because now you not only need to stay on top of your investments, your spending, and your tax bill, but you're also responsible for creating your own retirement paycheck. Yes, it can feel overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be if you take a systematic approach. Assess all your resources After decades of working and saving, it’s pretty common to have more than just one investment account. Are you including everything? Contact your old employers if you’re not sure. If they’re no longer in business or you have difficulty contacting them, try pbgc.gov or missingmoney.com. Consider consolidating accounts to help simplify managing your investments. Also think about how your home may fit into the picture. Are downsizing, renting, or a reverse mortgage potential options? How about part-time work or consulting? Do you have a hobby you can turn into a money-making enterprise? Don’t neglect these hidden assets and opportunities that can boost your income. Shore up your cash reserves Make sure you have enough cash or cash equivalents (savings accounts, money market accounts, or short-term CDs) to last at least one year. These days, cash may not earn much, but it’s important to have enough for emergencies. To avoid having to sell investments in a prolonged bear market, consider keeping one to four years’ worth of portfolio withdrawals in more liquid investments. Consider predictable sources of income Start by estimating how much you believe you'll receive from Social Security and any employer pensions. It's crucial to make smart decisions when claiming Social Security as these benefits represent about one-third of the income for the average retiree. If you don’t have a traditional pension plan, are unsure about having enough money and would like to have more guaranteed income to cover your essential expenses, you may want to look into lifetime income options through an annuity. Annuities aren’t for everyone. There are lots of different types and they can be difficult to understand, but they're uniquely designed to help accumulate money on a tax-sheltered basis or provide guaranteed lifetime income, or both. In its simplest form, an annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company. You pay for a promise or certain guarantees such as the ability to receive income guaranteed for life (subject to the claims paying ability of the insurer). You can often check out how much income certain annuities might generate with calculators. A few words of caution: be sure to pay close attention to fees, commissions, and surrender charges. An investment professional who understands your situation and works in your best interest can help you examine how employer pension options, health issues, Social Security claiming decisions, and income goals in retirement all come into play when you’re thinking about an annuity. Try a total return approach Living off interest and dividends without touching growth or the original investment may be an option for a few retirees, but it’s not a likely solution for most people. An alternative is a total return approach in which your withdrawal consists of all sources (interest, dividends, and growth), and may or may not involve touching the original investment to make up what you need. This can provide you with more flexibility as well as create more income. You can use the 4% rule as a starting point on how much to withdraw in retirement. Don't forget taxes and RMDs Strategically withdrawing from traditional, Roth, and taxable accounts to lower capital gains taxes and keep your tax bracket low can help you pay less in taxes and stretch out your savings. Roth accounts, for example, can provide you with qualified tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you turned 70½ before 2020, you may be subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs) from certain retirement accounts like traditional IRAs and 401(k)s under IRS rules. For 2020 and after, you may be subject to RMDs beginning at age 72. Failure to take mandatory withdrawals can be costly: a 50 percent penalty on top of income taxes! You’ll also want to ensure you have adequate tax withholding from retirement accounts. You can do this by making estimated payments or asking the firms you work with to withhold amounts. Not withholding enough could result in IRS penalties. Withholding too much means you're making an interest-free loan to the government. New help for a new era If this all sounds like a bit much to handle and you’re not a do-it-yourselfer, don’t worry. New options and services can help guide you through the process of withdrawing funds in the most cost-effective and tax-efficient way possible. This may also be an ideal time to seek out professional guidance, especially as you first establish your footing as a new retiree. One final thought. As you navigate your retirement, your financial needs will likely evolve along with your priorities. So stay involved, flexible, and willing to make adjustments when necessary. This is your time to take in all that life has to offer. After decades of hard work, you deserve nothing less. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, As I recently wrote, this holiday season is going to be different for a lot of people in terms of celebrations and gift giving, but there's one thing I fervently hope won't get lost in our new reality—the importance of charitable giving. Charitable organizations of all types and sizes are constantly in need of support. And with all the incredible challenges we continue to face, the need is greater than ever. You hear stories from around the country about food banks struggling to keep up with demand. About people who never had to seek help before suddenly needing assistance to pay not only for food, but also for basics like rent and utilities. I think it's significant that the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the World Food Programme (WFP). All this brings home the fact that many of the things we may have taken for granted in the past now present daily struggles for a lot of people—often in our own communities, maybe in our own families. In light of today's unusual circumstances, charitable giving becomes more than a financial decision; it becomes a personal commitment. So what can we all do? Start close to home Chances are there's a food bank in your area or a homeless shelter or senior services center that could use your help. Whether it's a donation of dollars, goods, services or a few volunteer hours, there's a special personal connection when you give back to your own community. I recently heard of an organization of entertainers that sets up live music every weekend at a local food distribution center. What a wonderful way to personally welcome those in need and support those volunteering. Choose organizations that extend your reach There are many well established organizations that serve the greater community all year round and would welcome extra contributions during the holidays. For instance, Meals on Wheels America not only delivers meals to more than 2.4 million seniors annually, it also provides other nutritional and social support—as well as a wonderful opportunity for volunteers to personally contribute their time and connect one-on-one. DonorsChoose, which supports teachers across the country with all kinds of projects, is currently focused on helping enhance at-home learning. See if there's a teacher in your community who could use your help at donorschoose.org. Of course, Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA), which offers teen money management programs among many others, has had a special place in my heart for many years. With local clubs in thousands of communities, you may find one near you that you can personally support. Include your kids While I always encourage parents to get their kids involved in giving at a young age, this year can be even more meaningful as many families are struggling more than usual. Your kids might even be seeing this firsthand in their schools and among their friends. Maybe they know of a family that could use a helping hand. Talk to them about the causes you support and why. If they have money of their own, consider pooling family resources to contribute together. And let them know that there's no shame in needing help—and tremendous reward in giving it. Put tax advantages to good use Tax advantages for giving are designed to help you as you help others, so why not put them to good use? From the “above the line” charitable contribution deduction of up to $300 if you claim the standard deduction in 2020/2021 to the expanded limits on charitable contributions for those who itemize, the CARES Act provides an added incentive to be generous this year. Opening a donor-advised fund, which allows you to personally direct your contributions to causes you care about, is another great way to combine your generosity with tax savings. In fact, what you save on taxes may allow you to give even more. You can even make it a family affair by deciding together which charities you'll support. Share your spirit as well as your dollars The spirit of the holidays can be contagious—and so can the spirit of giving. So, here's an idea. However you choose to make a donation this year, why not share it on social media? Tell your friends what you're doing and why. Share a link for your favorite cause. You may just start a giving trend that not only boosts your own charitable gift, it might also boost the spirits of all those you've encouraged to give. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': 'Most of us have an age at which we’d like to stop working—but what if circumstances change and retirement comes early? According to a 2020 survey conducted by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, nearly half of retirees reported leaving the workforce earlier than anticipated. That said, just because early retirement isn’t part of your plan doesn’t mean it isn’t doable. So, how do you know if you’re adequately prepared for early retirement? Follow these steps to find out. Step 1: Review your finances To begin, ask yourself four questions: What are my expenses now? It can be helpful to split your current expenses into two categories: must-haves like groceries and housing, and nice-to-haves like eating out and travel. How will my expenses change in retirement? While some costs, such as payroll taxes and retirement contributions, will go away, others, particularly health care, are likely to increase. Also factor in the potential for major one-time expenses, such as a child’s wedding, a new car, or a roof replacement. And don’t overlook the cost of long-term care—which roughly 70% of retirees will require at some point in their lives, according to longtermcare.gov. What’s my potential income? Tally up income from pensions, Social Security, and any other nonportfolio sources. Subtract that number from your target annual income to determine how much money you’ll need to generate from your portfolio. For example, if you need $90,000 a year in income and expect to receive $40,000 from nonportfolio sources, you’ll need $50,000 from your portfolio to meet your spending needs. What about health care? If you’re no longer covered by your employer-sponsored health insurance, you’ll need coverage until you become eligible for Medicare at age 65. Health care can take a big bite out of your income, so make sure to compare all available options, including COBRA, private insurance, and your spouse’s plan, if available. You may also be eligible for discounted coverage through organizations such as AARP. Step 2: Assess your portfolio Now that you have a clear picture of your income needs, ask yourself three questions to help determine the overall strength of your portfolio: Am I prepared to weather a downturn? Having adequate short-term reserves can help you avoid having to make a portfolio withdrawal during a bear market. We suggest having enough cash on hand to cover a year’s worth of retirement expenses, plus another two to four years’ worth of spending needs in short-term investments such as certificates of deposit and Treasury bills. Is my withdrawal rate sustainable? Keep in mind the 4% rule, which says that withdrawing 4% of your portfolio in your first year of retirement—and adjusting that number annually for inflation—will give your portfolio a high probability of lasting 30 years. Thus, if you want to withdraw $50,000 in your first year, a $1.25 million portfolio ($50,000/0.04) has a good chance of seeing you through retirement. Be aware, however, that this rule is conservative and doesn’t account for fluctuations in spending or market performance. A financial planner can help you develop a retirement plan, including a personalized spending rate based on your needs and time frame. Is my asset allocation in line with my time horizon, risk capacity, and risk tolerance? Maintaining a diversified, balanced portfolio becomes even more important in retirement to help prevent taking on too much—or too little—risk. For example, if you’re facing a retirement that could last a decade longer than planned, holding more stocks in the early years will help guard against the risk of outliving your savings. Just be sure you take a more conservative approach with the money you’ll need to tap in the next few years. Striking a balance between short-term income needs and longer-term growth is critical in retirement. Step 3: Dig into the details Making the shift from saving to spending can be challenging under the best of circumstances. The key is to plan your retirement with as much detail as possible—as well as with the understanding that you can’t predict everything and will likely need to make changes as your needs come into focus. A planner can help you take a hard look at your finances and make the necessary adjustments to keep your retirement on track—no matter when it hits.'}],\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Fractional shares make stock investing easier and more accessible—and more appealing to gift stock to a new investor.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I’ve been hearing about fractional shares as a way to invest in the stock market. Can you explain how they work? —A Reader Dear Reader, No question, the world of investing is overrun with a gazillion tools and products, many of which are either indecipherable or irrelevant to the average investor. But every once in a while, we can welcome the arrival of a new product—like fractional shares—that can actually make investing more accessible. So thank you for your question. For the benefit of other readers who may not have heard about this new addition to an investor’s toolbox, let’s first take a look at what fractional shares are and how they work, and then go over some of the best ways to put them to practical use. The new kid on the block Fractional shares are exactly what they sound like: a piece (or a ‘fraction’) of a single share of stock. To put this into historical perspective, it wasn’t all that long ago that stock trades were generally made in ‘round lots’ of 100 shares. If you ventured into the world of ‘odd lots,’ or anything less than 100 shares, you paid a higher fee. Eventually, as trading costs continued to drop, it became common for investors to trade as little as a single share. For many years that sounded pretty good, unless you were interested in owning a stock in a pricey company (like today’s Amazon, Alphabet or Apple). A single share of any of these companies’ stocks runs in the hundreds or even thousands of dollars, putting them well out of reach of many investors. Enter fractional shares. Now, suddenly, the price barrier is removed. With just the click of a mouse you can buy or sell a sliver of a share—and begin your journey as an individual stock investor. A few mechanics Because fractional shares are new, not every brokerage company offers them, and you will likely find different offers. In general, though, this is how it can work: If a company’s stock is selling for $1,000 per share and you invest $200, you would own 20 percent of a share. Or you could spread out your $200 among several stocks. As the share prices move up or down, the value of your holdings will also change proportionally. In general, many brokerage, traditional IRA, Roth IRA, Coverdell IRA and UTMA/UGMA accounts will all allow you to trade fractional shares. At least for now, it's unlikely that you’ll be able to buy or sell fractional shares in your 401(k) or a 529 College Savings Plan. Fractional shares as an introduction to investing When we’re first starting out as investors, many of us are advised to purchase a low-cost mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund, which is great for both ease and diversification. But owning and following a specific company like Apple or Tesla is a very different experience than owning a fund, and provides different lessons—from seeing how the share price responds to things like changing market conditions, or new product development or competition. For a new investor, it can also feel more personal to have a stake in a particular company, and spark a lifelong interest in investing. Fractional shares can help you diversify Probably the most important lesson for any new investor is the value of diversification. Therefore, as tempting as it may be to put all of our investment dollars into Amazon, Apple or a company that's developing a hot new product, that’s not recommended. It's much better to think of fractional shares as a way to round out your portfolio, using them to diversify without having to spend a lot of money. Building on the theme of diversification, both novice and more experienced investors can use fractional shares to implement a strategy I refer to as ‘Core & Explore.’ The concept is simple. If you first allocate the majority (say 80 to 90 percent) of your portfolio to a diversified ‘core’ comprised of a broad range of low-cost mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, you can then add a smaller ‘explore’ portion that includes a curated mix of individual stocks. Dollar-cost averaging can even out market volatility Fractional shares are also a great tool for a strategy called 'dollar-cost averaging.' This simply involves investing the same dollar amount at a regular interval (perhaps monthly) regardless of how the stock market is performing. The result is that you'll buy more shares when the market is down and fewer shares when the market is high, potentially smoothing out the impact of market swings and reducing your risk over time. I’m a fan of dollar-cost averaging because it takes the emotion out of investing at the same time that it provides discipline. With fractional shares, a new investor can get started with just a few dollars a month, and then build on that base over time. A gift that can last a lifetime Fractional shares can be great for all of the things I’ve discussed so far, and also especially handy for gifting stock to a child. In fact, one of the best ways I know to pique a young person's interest in investing is by giving them a portion of a real company. Although it may seem ideal if that stock appreciates in value over time, the more important part of the gift is what it can teach. For instance, experiencing losses when the stakes are low can also provide an invaluable lesson. You can use a gift as small as $5 or $25 to initiate conversations about compound growth, mitigating risk through diversification, and the importance of setting goals. So the next time a child or grandchild has a birthday or special occasion, we can consider giving them some stock in addition to (or instead of) a toy. A gift of first-hand experience and lessons on investing can last a lifetime. Looking to the future At its core, investing is about participating in the American and global economies with a view to future growth. Fractional shares can be a great way for new investors to get started on this journey, regardless of their age. But it’s important not to stop there. Fractional shares can provide a great entry point, but we all need to keep reading, learning, and asking questions. The true power of investing takes place over years and decades, not months or days.

       "   'abstract': 'When it comes to commodity ETFs, make sure you know what you’re getting.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Just because an investment drops in value doesn’t mean it’s a bargain. That’s a lesson many investors learned the hard way back in April when they scooped up shares of a popular oil exchange-traded fund (ETF) after the spot price of crude dropped below zero. Contrary to some investors’ expectations, the ETF continued to struggle for several days after the price of oil recovered. So where did investors go wrong? What they thought was a fund that tracked the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude—the U.S. benchmark for oil—was in fact a fund that tracked the benchmark’s futures contracts, which can produce very different returns. With any fund, but especially those that track commodities, it’s important to understand the fund’s strategy before you buy. Here are three questions to ask when researching commodity ETFs for your portfolio. 1. Does it hold physical assets or futures? Some precious-metal ETFs actually purchase the physical commodities—such as bars of gold or silver—and warehouse them in secure vaults. These ETFs tend to closely track the spot price of the commodity in question because the metals can be retrieved and sold on the spot market at any time. However, most commodities—including livestock, oil, and wheat—are too costly or cumbersome for an ETF to transport and store. Instead, ETFs typically invest in these commodities via futures contracts, which are agreements to buy a commodity on a future date for a specified price, with the intention of selling the contract before it expires rather than taking possession of the commodity in question. As a result, ETF managers must regularly sell expiring contracts and purchase new ones with later expiration dates—with two potential consequences: When contracts approaching expiration have higher prices than those with expiration dates further out, ETFs are effectively selling high and buying low with every contract rollover—a condition known as backwardation. This happens when the current demand for a commodity is higher than investors expect it to be in the future, relative to its supply. Conversely, when contracts approaching expiration have lower prices than those with expiration dates further out, ETFs are effectively selling low and buying high with every contract rollover—a condition known as contango. This happens when the current demand for a commodity is lower than investors expect it to be in the future, relative to its supply. While contango obviously isn’t ideal, fund managers often invest in futures contracts of various durations to help mitigate its effects. 2. How volatile is it? Commodity ETFs are notoriously volatile because of the supply-and-demand characteristics of their underlying holdings, which can be dramatically impacted by certain events. Unseasonably cold or wet weather, for example, can be catastrophic to some agricultural commodities, while OPEC (to say nothing of COVID-19) can unduly influence oil prices. One solution to this potential problem is to consider ETFs that track a broadly diversified commodity index. That said, the degree of diversification will vary by index. For example, 61.7% of the S&P GSCI Commodity Index is allocated to the more-volatile energy sector,1 while the Bloomberg Commodity Index’s allocation is roughly a third of that, at 23.4%.2 3. What is its tax treatment? The complexities of commodity ETFs can also create unusual tax issues. Funds with direct ownership of precious metals, for example, are taxed as collectibles under U.S. rules. Depending on your income tax bracket, the tax bill for this investment may be higher than the long-term capital gains rate or even your ordinary income tax rate. Funds that invest in futures and other derivatives contracts, on the other hand, may be structured as partnerships, meaning you get a K-1 tax form at the end of the year instead of the typical 1099. To avoid the complications and added expense K-1s can create at tax time, some newer funds pass their investments through an offshore entity, which allows the fund to be taxed like a traditional mutual fund. However, it’s important to note that such funds are actively managed and may offer less visibility into their underlying holdings. Know your fund Investing in commodity ETFs can be a low-cost way to add diversification and inflation protection to your long-term portfolio. However, if you’re looking to make shorter-term tactical moves, be sure you understand how the ETF you’re considering is constructed, since a fund’s volatility, in particular, can have an outsize impact on your short-term prospects. 1S&P GSCI methodology, as of 05/2020. 2Bloomberg Commodity Index fact sheet, as of 06/30/2020.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Worried about your holiday budget? With a little creativity, you can be generous without spending a fortune.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, Like so much in our lives this year, the holidays are going to be different for a lot of people. Family gatherings are likely to be smaller, if they happen at all. Money may be tighter, with very little available for gift-giving. Traditional celebrations may have to be scaled way back or put on hold. But while we all may feel a little disappointed by the changes made necessary by the pandemic, I like to think we can still have a meaningful holiday season. Perhaps this year, rather than being caught up in the usual buying frenzy, we can take time to be more personal and give extra thought to what would be the most appropriate way to acknowledge friends and family given the current circumstances. It takes some creative thinking, but it might just make the whole experience of giving—and receiving—more meaningful than ever. Here are some ideas. Focus first on reaching out Just because we can't all be together, doesn't mean we can't make a special effort to reach out to the people who are important to us. And it doesn't have to be about gifts. Of course, giving traditional gifts is fun and I enjoy choosing what I think is ideal for someone. But you can show those you care about how much they mean to you in many ways that don't have to cost a lot. So first make a list of the people you'd like to acknowledge. Start with those dearest to you. If you want to give them a traditional gift, think about what would be most appreciated. It's not just about how much money you spend—even if money isn't an issue—but rather about why you think a certain gift will be just right. For some on your list, a small token will be meaningful. For others, sending a personal note that shows you're thinking about them can be enough to bring them some holiday cheer. Think about a possible long-term benefit of your gift It's fun to choose the perfect gift for someone and watch as they open it. But if you can wrap your gift in a long-term benefit—something with a future focus—it can be even more special. One way to give your gift added meaning is to include some of your own financial know-how as part of the package. Everyone in your life—from your youngest child to your parents or grandparents—could likely use some extra help in managing their money. For instance: The perfect sweater might make your teenage daughter momentarily happy, but attaching it to a clothing allowance that she'll have to manage would give you the chance to teach her about budgeting, saving and spending wisely. A piggy bank for a younger child could come with a savings account and a future trip to your bank to learn about how money grows over time. Is someone on your list a student working part-time or a young adult with a new job? How about helping them open a Traditional or Roth IRA, maybe with some initial funding from you? You could even offer to match their contributions for a time. Get them started investing for the long-term and you've given a gift with a potential lifetime of value. Even older adults, perhaps your parents, might benefit from a gift of knowledge. If they're struggling economically and you can help out in some way, that's great. But if you can also help them budget more wisely and ensure they're making the most of their Social Security and Medicare benefits, that could make your gift even more valuable. Even if they aren't struggling, you could help them fine-tune specifics like insurance or estate planning by arranging for them to meet with the appropriate professional. That could open the door to important future conversations. Add extra meaning to money gifts A gift of cash is always appreciated. But you can give that money a meaningful context by earmarking it for a larger purpose or a long-term goal. For example, opening and funding a savings or custodial account for a young person is a way to introduce personal finance and investing basics. Consider giving individual or fractional shares of stock to sweeten the deal. Creating or adding to a 529 plan for a child or grandchild is a gift to the parents as well as to the child. Or if kids are already in college, you could offer to make a direct tuition payment to the school. Helping with student loans can ease the financial burden for college grads. Another idea is to jumpstart the process of saving for a big-ticket item like a car, a computer or a family trip. Or if you know that someone on your list has a cause or charity that's of particular importance, you could make a donation in that person's name. Share an experience For a lot of us, one of the most difficult things right now is not being able to spend time together. But hopefully that will change, so why not plan something you can look forward to? Whether it's with a friend or family member, planning a special event together—a dinner, a visit to the museum, a long weekend away—can be the most perfect gift of all. If you can foot the bill, that's great. But even if you can't pick up the complete tab, sharing the cost as well as the experience can be just as thoughtful. Stay connected Now, more than ever, we all need to know that others are there for us. The holidays can be a lonely time for some, and these days the sense of isolation can be even greater. So no matter how different your holiday celebrations may be this year, stay connected. Whether it's a gift, a card, a photograph, a phone call or a virtual gathering, the spirit you share can make this a joyful time in spite of the challenges—and help us all look ahead to brighter days.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I’m one year into my four-year contract in the Army. I currently live off-base, but hate wasting my money on rent. I’m thinking about buying, especially since interest rates are so low and real estate prices just keep climbing. I don’t have much cash, but I don’t need a down payment for a Veterans Affairs loan. I figure if I stay in the Army and have to move, I can either sell or rent it out. My dad is all in favor of buying now but my mom says I should wait until I leave the military. What do you think? —A Reader Dear Reader, As the different opinions in your family demonstrate, buying a home versus renting is often a tough decision—and especially complicated for someone like you who may be forced to move without much notice. A Veterans Affairs loan can certainly help with the purchase, but there’s a lot more to consider as you look to the future. Is renting a waste of money? First, let me say that I don’t believe renting is always a waste of money. In fact, depending on the circumstances, renting can be cheaper and more practical than owning a home. Renting can make a lot of sense if you’re not going to be in the same place for at least five to seven years. If you stay in a home for many years, the substantial upfront costs of buying a home are spread out over a long time. Not so if you’re forced to move soon. Plus, as we saw during the Great Recession ten years ago, homes don’t always appreciate in value, and you wouldn’t want to be forced to sell in a downturn. Renting can also make sense if you don’t have ample cash reserves. As a renter, you can call the landlord if something breaks. When you own, you are the landlord, and you’re on the hook for all the costs of maintaining and repairing the property. On the flip side, when you buy a home you have the ability to build equity. But this takes time, sometimes many years. A good exercise is to use an online calculator to estimate the costs of renting vs. owning. A lot depends on your location. In some areas there’s a big difference; in others, not so much. Just be sure to gather your information and do a careful analysis before you decide. Consider total costs and affordability The cost of owning a home involves a lot more than the purchase price. In addition to paying your mortgage, you’ll also have to pay for property taxes, property insurance, maintenance and repair costs, utilities, and possibly HOA fees. And there are also “closing costs” associated with buying a home. These are one-time expenses and fees—including appraisals, title insurance, attorney’s fees and more—which, according to Realtor.com, can run as high as 5 to 6 percent of the purchase price of your home. So think about all of this in the context of your entire financial picture. A general financial planning guideline is that your monthly mortgage payment shouldn’t exceed 28 percent of your gross monthly income, and your total monthly debt payments shouldn’t exceed 36 percent. If your expenses are higher, you may not have room to cover other essential expenses—including retirement saving. As an active-duty service member, your basic allowance for housing (BAH) and for subsistence (BAS) also come into play. Whether you rent or buy, it’s possible to have allowances left over each month to pay for things like utilities and other household expenses or even savings. What happens if you have to move? Deployment or permanent change of station orders can be a huge issue when you're a homeowner. As a renter, service members are protected under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) in breaking a lease without penalty. SCRA also provides interest rate and foreclosure protections if you own a home, but you still have to manage mortgage payments and the care of the property while you're away. Also think about the strength of your local housing market. If you buy a home and are forced to move, could you be stuck with an unsold or unrented property for an extended time? If you have a renter, would you be able to manage the property from afar, especially if you're in a remote or distant location and working irregular hours? How much would a property manager charge? Do you understand the tax implications of renting your home? Take time to understand what you’re getting into. VA home loans have advantages Generally, active duty service members, veterans, Reservists and National Guard members in good standing and meeting other eligibility requirements qualify for a VA loan as do certain surviving spouses. VA loans can be used to build, purchase or refinance a primary residence. They’re not designed to finance second homes or investment properties, although you can rent out a home with a VA mortgage once you’ve lived in it. As you mention, one of the benefits of a VA mortgage (unlike a conventional mortgage) is not having to make a down payment. But, just because you don’t have to doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. In fact, the smaller your down payment, the more you have to borrow and the bigger your monthly payment. Conversely, the bigger your down payment, the smaller your mortgage payments. VA Home Loans are provided by private lenders, such as banks and mortgage companies. VA guarantees a portion of the loan, enabling the lender to provide more favorable terms. Other benefits often include: No private mortgage insurance (PMI) requirement. PMI is usually required when you have a conventional loan and make a down payment of less than 20 percent of the home’s purchase price. No pre-payment penalty. No minimum credit score (although the lender may have their own requirements). These combined benefits can make it easier to get into a home and save you thousands over the life of a loan. Remember though, just because it may be easier to get into a home doesn’t necessarily mean your housing costs will be lower than renting. Weighing your options Buying your first home is always a big decision, and even more complicated when you’re in the military. It can work, but will require careful thought and contingency planning—both of which should be familiar to you given your military training. Ask around to see what others who have gone down this road think and have experienced. In the meantime, happy Veteran’s Day and thank you for your service! Have a personal finance question?

At this stage of life I don't have a lot of time to “make it back” in the market. What's the best plan for selling off stocks and moving into more secure savings? —A Reader Dear Reader, The last several months have been a whipsaw for a lot of people. And even though the market has largely recovered from the sharp drawdown when the pandemic hit (at least for now), many investors are worried about how best to protect themselves if and when it happens again. Those worries can be even greater for older investors who are close to or in retirement. At this point, the money you've accumulated isn't just a number related to a future goal—it's what you need to live on now. I hear similar concerns from many older readers. Even in the best of times, the transition from saving to spending isn't just financial; it's emotional. In times of high uncertainty, those emotions run even higher. But while that may leave you with a strong desire to sell your stock holdings, you're absolutely right that it's best to have a plan—and that plan should be determined by your own circumstances, not by what the market's doing at the moment. Let's look at some important things to consider before you make any changes. Start with your current financial situation Your first step should be to get a clear understanding of where you stand now, looking at three criteria: your current net worth, your projected cash flow over the next several years, and your current asset allocation. Your net worth (what you owe minus everything you own) gives you a big picture view of your holdings. Zeroing in on your essential vs. discretionary expenses gives you a good sense of your cash needs and how much you'll need to withdraw from your portfolio each year. Finally, how your portfolio is currently divided between stocks, bonds, and cash completes the picture. Together, these three pieces of information can provide context for any changes you might want to make now and in the future. Let your timeline guide you To weather a bear market, it's generally recommended that retirees have enough to cover two to four years of essential expenses in readily accessible holdings like fixed income and cash. The problem, of course, is that these investments don't yield much in today's low-interest environment. But they do provide stability. Plus it can make you feel more secure to know you have the money you need without being forced to sell in a down market. Get specific about when you'll need your money to help you decide where to keep it. Ideally, money you'll need within two years should be in cash or cash equivalents. With your cash needs covered, consider bonds for money you'll need in three to five years. Money you won't need for five to seven years or longer could be in stocks. Avoid dramatic shifts You may be more worried about market risk at this point in life—and market uncertainty may have you ready to bail out—but don't let your emotions take over. Just as it's never a good idea to try to time the market as you're getting in, don't try to time your way out either. Lessening the risk in your portfolio gradually is the most prudent. This is one of the reasons why managers of target-date funds gradually shift from stocks into bonds and cash the closer the investor gets to retirement. You might also think of it this way. Many investors reach their stock positions by dollar-cost averaging—investing a set amount of money over time to smooth out the highs and lows. You could now apply that same principle in reverse by shifting your investments over time out of stocks and into bonds and cash. Create your rebalance plan Let's say your portfolio is currently 75 percent stocks, 25 percent fixed income, and you want to reallocate to 50/50. Probably not the best move to immediately sell 25 percent of your stocks. Instead, to shift gradually you could: Have all dividends and interest transferred into a bank account rather than reinvesting them. Sell a percentage of your winners to reap the profits and realize some gains. Take advantage of tax-loss harvesting by selling some losers, using the losses to offset any taxable gains. Sell overweighted stocks in retirement accounts to create the cash for RMDs (beginning after age 70 or 72 depending on your birthday). By doing this periodically (weekly, monthly, quarterly or even over different tax years), you'll increase your cash holdings in a more balanced way and reduce the potential for regret if the market swiftly changes directions. Just how much and how quickly you rebalance is up to you. The most important thing is to stay true to your feelings about risk, be realistic about how much risk you can afford to take at this point in life—and stick to your plan. An advisor can help with the specifics of how and when to rebalance across accounts as well as help you consider the tax implications. Some robo-advisors and managed accounts can also keep you balanced automatically. Stay diversified As you contemplate moving away from stocks, remember that even in retirement—and that can be a long time these days—stocks may remain an important part of your portfolio. Keeping 20 to 30 percent in stocks is a way for even a conservative investor to maintain some opportunity for growth and keep up with inflation. So while it's smart to have more in cash in your older years, maintaining a diversified portfolio is a strong hedge against uncertainty at any age. When it comes to investing, it's never all or nothing. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I recently accepted a position at a small start-up where my salary is about the same, but I will also get stock options. Can you please tell me what I need to know about company stock options? —A Reader Dear Reader, First, let me say congratulations! Starting a new job can come with big changes in your life, impacting everything from your role and responsibilities and the people you work with to how much—and how—you\\'re compensated. I’m glad you\\'re asking about stock options, not only because they can represent a significant part of your compensation, but also because they\\'re often misunderstood. In fact, according to a recent Schwab survey, the average vested value of U.S. workers’ equity compensation is about $75,000. At the same time, 85 percent of employees would like their employer to do a better job explaining how equity compensation works. Nearly two in five employees say they are more likely to need financial advice due to the pandemic. Stock options are just one of many different kinds of equity compensation. Rather than directly giving you stock as in the case of let’s say, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), with stock options your employer gives you the right (or the option) to buy company stock at a favorable fixed price for a specific period of time. In this way, stock options—and any other form of equity compensation—are simply another way for your employer to recruit, retain, and reward valued employees. Unlike a salary, however, they allow you to become part owner of your company. Your employer is encouraging you to \"think and act like an owner,\" working harder and smarter. As an owner, you benefit when the share price increases and when the company distributes profits in the form of dividends. Let’s first take a look at how the two main types of stock options are valued, and then review some larger financial planning considerations. In order to maximize this potentially valuable asset, it\\'s important for you to understand exactly what you own and to keep in mind key dates and milestones. A few basics on stock options When you receive stock options, you’ll also get a written award agreement. This is an important document that contains details that you\\'ll want to keep and refer to before taking any action, including “exercising” your stock options. Exercising a stock option means purchasing the stock at the fixed price set by the option (“the exercise” or “strike” price). The greater the difference between the stock price and this exercise price, called the “spread,” the greater the value of the option. “Underwater” stock options, however, have an exercise price higher than the market price of the underlying stock and thus have no current value. You can sell your exercised shares (subject to any company-imposed trading restrictions or blackout periods) immediately after purchasing them, or hold and sell them at a later date. Tax consequences chiefly depend on what kind of option you own, when you exercise, and when you sell. There are two main types of stock options: Non-qualified stock options (NQSOs) are the most common. Exercising NQSOs triggers ordinary income tax on the difference between your exercise price and the stock’s market value. Your employer will usually withhold income tax, Social Security and Medicare upon exercise. Later, when you decide to sell the shares, either immediately or after a holding period, any gains or losses will be subject to either long- or short-term capital gains tax rules. Incentive stock options (ISOs) are less common, but popular in the tech sector both for start-ups and mature firms. Usually, there are no taxes upon exercise, but exercising can trigger AMT taxes. If you then hold the shares for more than two years from the date of grant and more than one year from the date of exercise, you incur favorable long-term capital gains tax (rather than ordinary income tax) on all appreciation over the exercise price. Financial planning is key As you can see, knowing what type of stock options you own and the company and IRS rules that govern them is critically important. Not knowing can expose you to greater risks, higher taxes and missed opportunities to build wealth. Here are a few more planning considerations with stock options: Vesting—Typically, you must continue to work for a company for a specified length of time before you\\'re allowed to exercise stock options. This length of time is called the vesting period, which can be all at once or gradually over time. Once you\\'re vested, you have the right to exercise the shares. On the other hand, you have no control over unvested shares—you can’t exercise or benefit from them until you vest. Timing—Because stock options have an expiration date (typically 7 or 10 years), it’s important to think ahead. Waiting until options approach expiration can limit your flexibility in making a more strategic decision and also lead to higher taxes. Even worse—your options may expire unused. Taxes—Taxation issues related to exercising and selling NQSOs and ISOs can be complex. For example, even if your employer will withhold income taxes when exercising NQSOs, this amount may be inadequate and leave you with a big tax bill. With AMT considerations at exercise and special tax rules around selling, ISOs are even more complicated and require more tax planning. Concentration—While it’s great to show your allegiance to your company, taking concentrated bets in any stock—particularly your own company stock—can lead to financial ruin. Stay diversified and use caution when holding more than 20 percent of your portfolio in any one position. Remember, you already have considerable exposure to the financial success of the company as an employee! Talk to an advisor and your HR department Sound a bit confusing? It is. And all the more reason to work closely with a financial advisor and tax professional before you make any moves. Prior to taking action on buying, exercising or selling, you’ll want to plan ahead and carefully consider the tax consequences, risks and timing of any options you receive. For advice on your personal financial situation, be sure to consult a tax advisor. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'Being prepared in advance for a catastrophic emergency is essential—and that includes a financial \"go bag.\"',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I know I need an emergency fund, but with all the disasters happening these days, what should I have ready in terms of my finances if I have to pick up and leave in a hurry? —A Reader Dear Reader, Between the pandemic, hurricanes, wildfires and floods, these days you need to be as ready as possible for the unexpected. Being 100 percent prepared for every potential type of catastrophe is impossible, but there are definitely things you can do now to mitigate your stress and harm in the time of crisis. From packing an emergency bag with basic physical necessities to planning an escape route, being prepared in advance is essential—and that includes preparing a \"go bag\" for your finances. What to put in your physical go bag is pretty clear—extra clothes, water, medicines, toiletries, flashlight and batteries, phone charger, items for your pets. Ready.gov has a great basic list. But how do you prepare a financial go bag? That may not be as obvious, and probably will differ from person to person. Many people are comfortable storing essential documents digitally, while others prefer having paper copies, and still others might want a combination. But whether your go bag is physical or digital, or a bit of both, there are several important documents to gather and steps to take. Start with cash on hand Establishing an emergency fund is the first to-do, ideally with enough cash or cash equivalents to cover three-to-six months of essential expenses. Of course, you have to be able to get to it quickly, so make sure to keep this money easily accessible in a savings or money market account. Don\\'t have much available? Look at your options. Focus on other ways to increase your cash even if that means squeezing expenses or selling assets to fill up your emergency fund. Next, be sure to keep some physical cash on hand. While we take ATMs and credit cards for granted, they may not work in a disaster. There\\'s no set amount to target, but having enough in your pocket to cover a few days of food, gas or lodging for you and your family could be a lifesaver. Include a few checks and an extra credit and ATM card just in case. Organize important documents from passports to passwords As you assemble your go bag, start with information that can help you establish proof of identity and proof of ownership. This should include identification papers such as your driver\\'s license, passport, Social Security, Medicare and health insurance cards, birth and marriage certificates and military papers. Next, think about how best to access lengthier documents such as real estate titles, proof of insurance, estate plan documents, your most recent tax return, car title and registration (some of this might be available through electronic records with your service providers). Make lists of important phone numbers, account numbers and passwords, and prescriptions. And thinking about documents, if you haven\\'t done so already, make sure your doctor and local hospital have copies of your advance healthcare directive on file. If collecting all this information seems overwhelming, FEMA provides an Emergency Financial First Aid Kit with a checklist to help you itemize and organize your documents. Keep it all safe yet accessible While you may have hard copies of your records safely tucked away in places like a fireproof and waterproof safe, file cabinet at home or a bank safe deposit box, a severe disaster could make it impossible to access them for an extended period of time. Storing electronic documents in the \"cloud\"—a virtual location you can access anywhere with a secure username and password—is another way to keep your documents secure. All you need are your documents and a scanner. If you don’t have a scanner, your library, workplace or neighborhood printing and mailing facility may have one. Taking photos on your phone or storing electronic copies of documents on a portable thumb drive that you can take with you is also an option. Having online access to documents can also simplify things. Most financial services firms keep electronic records or images of documents like statements and checks. You might also choose to give copies of important papers like estate plans, vehicle/home title, passports, etc. to an attorney, financial advisor or a trusted friend or family member with the caveat that this information is only to be accessed with your approval or the approval of someone you\\'ve designated to make decisions for you if you\\'re unable to make them yourself. Take a picture A great way to verify your possessions is to take photographs or videos of the rooms in your home and any valuable belongings. This simple act could save you hours of time in the event you had to itemize losses for an insurance claim. Depending on your preference, you can store these photos digitally or keep paper copies. A few extra precautions As you prepare your financial go bag, make sure your documents are up to date. Review your insurance policies to verify you have the right kind and amount of coverage. Double check that your life insurance and account beneficiaries are accurate. Be sure the information on all your financial documents is current. Now would also be a good time to check your credit score. If it\\'s lower than you\\'d like, take action to improve it so you\\'re prepared for any emergency borrowing needs. Once your financial go bag is ready, hopefully you\\'ll never have to use it. But just to be on the safe side, take the time to review and update it once a year or anytime you have a major life event like a move, marriage, addition to the family or job change. You can’t prepare for everything, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t takes steps to be as prepared as possible. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': \"It's Open Enrollment time again. Here's why you shouldn't ignore it.\",\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, As we approach Open Enrollment, I\\'m hoping every single one of you will take the time to carefully review your choices. There\\'s no question that employee benefits are always a significant part of your financial life. But this year, as millions of Americans face health and financial challenges as a result of the COVID pandemic, they may well be more important than ever. So don\\'t just assume that what worked in the past is the best for you now. Use Open Enrollment to thoughtfully evaluate your options. Health insurance: One of the most important to review yearly You never want to be complacent about health insurance, but especially not in the middle of a pandemic. If you\\'re lucky enough to have health insurance through your employer, make sure you\\'re getting the most comprehensive coverage you can afford. For instance, do you have a choice between a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)? A PPO usually offers more flexibility, while an HMO may have lower monthly premiums and additional benefits in exchange for getting healthcare services within a plan\\'s provider network. It\\'s worthwhile to do a thorough cost comparison of each, including premiums, deductibles, copayments, co-insurance and out-of-pocket maximums. If you have a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) ($1,400 for an individual, $2,800 for a family), look into getting a health savings account (HSA). An HSA operates somewhat like an IRA for medical expenses. For 2022, the annual limit on tax-deductible contributions is $7,300 for a family and $3,650 for individuals with self-only coverage, with a $1,000 catch-up contribution for age 55 plus. In addition to the upfront tax deduction, money can be withdrawn from an HSA tax-free for qualified medical expenses including deductibles, copayments, prescriptions and fees for medical services. Plus, there\\'s no \"use-it-or-lose-it\" annual catch as there is with a flexible spending account (FSA). (Although an FSA allows you to pay for certain medical or dependent care expenses with pre-tax dollars.) Unused money in an HSA can continue to grow tax-deferred for health care costs in the future, and you\\'ll often have a number of investment choices to help your money grow and keep up with the rising cost of health care. As you review your choices, be sure to coordinate with your spouse or partner. If you have different options between employer plans, choose carefully. You might even be able to mix and match. For instance, one plan may offer low-cost vision or dental coverage that the other doesn\\'t. All this research takes some effort, but it’s absolutely worth it. Life insurance: The good, the bad, and the difficult Group term life insurance is a good news/bad news story. On the plus side, employees are often offered some level of basic coverage either for free or at a reduced cost, and you\\'re not required to undergo a physical exam to qualify. On the down side, the basic coverage may not be sufficient, especially if you have a partner or young children who depend on you financially. In that case, consider a supplemental group policy or an individual policy. Individual life insurance coverage can be more cost effective if you\\'re in above average health and it’s often customizable to fit unique needs. If you\\'re in poor health, be aware that it may be difficult to qualify for private coverage. But don\\'t stop there. Speak to an insurance specialist for more assistance and to help figure out what amount and type of life insurance coverage makes the most sense. If you do go with a group policy, find out if you can take the policy with you should you leave your job. While group policies are generally portable, there\\'s usually a short widow of opportunity to keep it, as well as other restrictions. Disability insurance: Dealing with the odds Disability is more likely than death. In fact, it\\'s estimated that more than 1 in 4 of today\\'s 20-year-olds will become disabled before they retire. What will you do if you can’t work? First, check to see if your company offers disability insurance and what kind. You may have just short-term coverage (up to two years). Even if you have long-term coverage, it may not be enough. Plus, disability insurance through your employer is generally not portable and will lapse when you leave the company. But don\\'t let that stop you. By all means, take your company’s policy, especially if it\\'s free. Then, as an extra precaution, consider purchasing a private disability policy to cover at least 55 percent of your salary for 12 months. Don\\'t overlook retirement Annual enrollment is a great time to check in with your retirement goals. Are you on track? To me, contributing to a 401(k) up to the employer match is essential and the minimum you do. The annual 401(k) contribution limit for 2022 is $20,500 with a $6,500 catch-up for age 50 plus. Use this time to increase your contribution as much as you can. There may be more Check to see if your company package includes: A Dependent Care FSA—This lets you set aside pre-tax dollars up to a maximum of $5,700 per year per family as long as both spouses work, are looking for work, or are full-time students. Partner benefits—Some companies offer health insurance to domestic partners. Long-term care insurance—If offered, the most cost-effective time to purchase a policy is between ages 50 and 65. Group legal services—An employer may also offer basic legal services for a low monthly cost. While we\\'re talking about Open Enrollment, I want to remind anyone with Medicare that October 15 to December 7, 2022, is your window of opportunity to make changes to Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans. Yes, it\\'s a lot of detail, but think of it this way: A benefits tune-up this fall can be the best foundation for your finances all year round. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, October is the month for fall colors, a chill in the air, Halloween—and financial planning. Yes, October is National Financial Planning Month. And while that might not stir your senses in quite the same way, it really could make a significant difference in your ability to enjoy every season to the fullest. So even though you may believe that financial planning isn’t important for you, I ask you to hear me out. A lot of people think they don\\'t have enough money to need a financial plan or that it costs too much. They\\'re putting the emphasis on \"financial.\" To me, the emphasis should be on \"planning,\" because having a financial plan simply means knowing where you want to go and figuring out how best to harness your resources to get there. And it’s not just about money. It\\'s about your aspirations, your priorities for you and your family, and how to protect yourself both now and in the future. Real questions for real people I can’t emphasize enough that a financial plan isn\\'t something esoteric or only for wealthy investors. It doesn\\'t have to be complicated or take a lot of time. And nowadays, it doesn\\'t have to be expensive. There are many ways of getting a financial plan—from DIY to online to in-person. At its essence, a financial plan answers real questions for real people whatever their stage of life or how much money they have. So to pique your interest and perhaps get you thinking differently, here are seven questions a financial plan can help you answer and why each one is important—for everyone. 1) How realistic is it to reach all of my dreams and goals? You may have a general idea of what you want to accomplish—buy a home, send your kids to college, take annual vacations or retire early. But the only way to make any of that happen is to get specific. A financial plan starts with helping you zero in on what you own and what you owe, and clarifies how your income can cover essentials as well as savings and discretionary expenses. It will help you focus on your goals, put a dollar amount on each and create a realistic timeline for achieving them. 2) What should I do first? Trying to save, invest and pay off debt all at once can be overwhelming. A basic plan helps you prioritize, whether you\\'re creating a savings strategy, trying to reduce debt, or both. It can give you a blueprint for taking action; for example, getting a 401(k) match first, next paying off nondeductible high-interest debt, then contributing to your child\\'s education. These aren\\'t high finance issues; these are everyday issues. 3) How should I invest for retirement as well as shorter-term goals like a down payment or kids\\' education? How you invest has a lot to do with when you need the money. The longer the timeframe, the more risk you can afford to take, depending on your own feelings about risk. Generally speaking, money you\\'ll need within the next six-to-eighteen months, like an emergency fund or a vacation, should be in cash. Money for intermediate goals that you may need in two-to-four years, like a home down payment, might be conservatively invested in bonds. Savings for longer-term goals more than five-to-seven years out, for instance retirement or college, could reasonably be invested in stocks. Once you\\'ve answered questions one and two, you\\'ll more easily be able to pinpoint how to invest for your various goals. 4) What\\'s the best way to protect my family and myself? A financial plan can also help you focus on crucial issues like emergency preparation and insurance. Do you have enough cash to cover at least three-to-six month\\'s essential living expenses? When was the last time you reviewed your health insurance coverage? Do you need life or disability insurance and how much? These are the deeper questions a plan can help you answer to protect your family from the unexpected. 5) When will I be able to retire and how much will I need? As you prioritize your savings goals, retirement should be high on your list, because the earlier you start planning the better. But planning for when you\\'ll be able to retire isn\\'t about saving blindly; it\\'s about projecting your needs with some degree of accuracy. So back to question one. Your current expenses provide a reasonable starting point to estimate a retirement budget. This will give you an idea of how much you need to save, when you can realistically retire, and if you\\'re on track. 6) What if something should happen to me? This is the key reason for estate planning—another concept that many people feel doesn\\'t apply to them. But we all need to think about who will take care of our children, who will make financial and medical decisions if we can\\'t do it for ourselves, and how we want our assets and personal property distributed. Again, it\\'s not about \"how much,\" but rather about \"how\" we want these decisions to be made. A financial plan helps keep you in charge, so someone else doesn’t make decisions for you. 7) What am I overlooking? There are a lot of pieces to our financial lives. And sometimes it\\'s hard to see them all, let alone how they fit together. A financial plan lays them out for you so you can see if something is missing. If you can work with a financial planning professional, so much the better. A set of trained eyes can help you address any savings shortfalls, improve your budget, and save on taxes. Answers that go beyond money The process of creating a financial plan can be just as important as the plan itself. It can help you think through and more confidently make life decisions; it can give you the assurance that your family is covered in the face of an uncertain world; and it can help couples be on the same page as they deal with present worries and future hopes. In other words, financial planning can be liberating—not just for you personally, but for your entire family as well. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, I have an unusual question for you: If your kids could learn about paying off a mortgage or controlling debt by playing an online fantasy game would you give them a bit more screen time? How about fighting zombies and saving the world from aliens while making smart financial decisions? If you\\'re not a gamer, that probably sounds a bit crazy. But if you\\'ve heard about games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons or Misadventures in Money Management, you may know what I\\'m talking about. This recently released Animal Crossing, for example, is getting a lot of attention and not just for the usual reasons. It actually teaches players about basic financial concepts in a way that kind of sneaks up on them as they get involved in buying and selling real estate and goods, building infrastructure—even investing. Using games to teach money and finance isn\\'t new, but as video games become more sophisticated—and concern about screen time becomes more of an issue in households where everyone is sheltering in place—I think it could make sense for parents to turn what often is a battleground into an opportunity. A virtual economy can teach real-life lessons Studies have suggested that playing video games can actually improve decision-making skills, memory and strategic thinking. Take this a step further and it\\'s not hard to see how games that include sophisticated virtual economies can help players make better real-life financial decisions. For instance, Animal Crossing: New Horizons includes a market that makes the concept of buying low and selling high real as players use in-game, virtual currency to buy a particular commodity (in this case, turnips) at varying prices. The goal, of course, is to sell them at a higher price. But investing is only one financial activity. There are all types of life-like transactions from making mortgage payments to buying furniture to setting up a store—even saving in a bank that offers interest at changing rates to reflect current times. Success in the game requires an understanding of supply and demand, smart spending, managing your game currency wisely and more. Does that sound like fun? Yes! Does it sound like life? Yes, again! There are financial literacy games for all ages But you don\\'t have to rely on the latest video game craze to get your kids—or yourself— involved. Realizing the potential of games to bring financial literacy to life, nonprofit organizations like Next Gen Personal Finance (NGPF) have developed several financial games to teach practical money skills to students. NGPF is just one of many. Here are a few more to explore: The FINRA Investor Education Foundation created the Con \\'Em If You Can game to teach middle school through college players how to recognize and defend against fraud. The Stock Market Game, supported by SIFMA (Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association) gives high school students the chance to invest a hypothetical $100,000 portfolio. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau offers the game Misadventures in Money Management, a game particularly for military service members on how to avoid financial pitfalls. The Council of Economic Education has partnered with the makers of Minecraft\\'s Education Edition to help teachers show students how economic decisions make a positive or negative impact on their built environment. And the list goes on. Whether you\\'re a football fan or a classic comic book lover, there\\'s a financially focused videogame that will not only keep you engaged but also help you improve your financial skills. A lot of fun—and a bit of caution Don\\'t get me wrong. I\\'m not advocating that you give in when your kids push for more screen time. My husband and I have two grown boys who loved (and still do love) their game time. I can identify with the frustrations many parents go through with managing your children\\'s love for gaming. My husband and I nearly tore our hair out trying to reduce screen time when they were younger. But maybe you can use some of these financial video games as a bargaining chip—giving them screen time for the right type of game. That in itself could be kind of a financial lesson. You might even tie some of the lessons they learn online to real-life experiences with their own money, helping them earn, save and budget for things they want. As with any online activity, set up parental controls as appropriate and help your child take steps to protect passwords and personal information to avoid hacking and fraudsters. However, when it comes to actual investing, I caution everyone to remember that it\\'s not a game. Online investing apps can make it easy to \"play,\" but financial decisions—especially when investing—are serious business. I\\'m all for making financial learning fun, but when it comes to managing real money, be sure to use all the critical and strategic thinking skills you may have learned in the virtual world to make well-thought-out decisions that actually make sense in real life.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My husband and I are curious about long-term care insurance. It all seems so confusing. How can we decide if (and when) we should buy it, and if so, what kind? —A Reader Dear Reader, Not only am I glad you\\'re investigating one of the biggest risks to retirement security, I\\'m also really happy you\\'re looking at this issue together. If either one of you ultimately needs long-term care, it will impact you both. Long-term care (LTC) insurance comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, but all policies have some features in common. I\\'ve talked about some basics and the importance of LTC insurance before, but choosing a policy requires some extra thought. Here\\'s what you need to know. There are two types of policies—standalone and hybrid Traditional, standalone policies just cover LTC. They\\'re simpler, but premiums can increase over time and benefits are typically \\'use it or lose it.\\' In other words, it\\'s possible you\\'d pay increasing premiums over decades, and then suddenly pass away without ever using the benefit. New \"hybrid\" policies combine LTC benefits with life insurance or lifetime income (annuity) benefits. While hybrid policies are more complex, they\\'ve increased in popularity, largely because the insured or a beneficiary receives some benefit even if there\\'s no LTC claim. Additionally, many hybrid policies limit the period for paying premiums (for example in a lump sum or over 10 years), protecting you from having to pay a larger premium in the future. LTC insurance is not health insurance Both standalone and hybrid LTC insurance are designed to cover what the industry calls \\'activities of daily living,\\' or ADLs—not general healthcare. Medicare doesn’t cover this type of custodial care, which helps with eating, bathing, dressing, continence, transitioning, and toileting, or if you have cognitive impairment. In general, LTC policies will begin to pay benefits if you\\'re unable to perform two out of the six ADLs. LTC insurance isn\\'t cheap—but not having it can be a lot more expensive There\\'s no two ways around it. LTC insurance is expensive. In general, insurance companies base their prices on the probability an event will occur and the cost of providing a benefit. In the case of LTC insurance, both are high: The lifetime probability of needing help with at least two activities of daily living or of being cognitively impaired is 68 percent for people age 65 and older. The average national monthly cost for a private room in a nursing home is $8,821 per month (2020). Like life insurance, LTC insurance is cheaper the younger and healthier you are. Additionally, policies for females are more expensive than for males due to higher potential claims and longer life expectancy. As a general guideline, purchasing a LTC policy makes the most sense between ages 50 and 65. That\\'s because if you buy it when you\\'re young, you\\'ll most likely be paying premiums for decades; if you wait too long, the cost may be prohibitive or a change in your health may make you ineligible. Several key factors determine the cost of a LTC policy; for example, number of years of coverage, maximum monthly or daily benefit caps, the wait period before the policy pays, and any inflation rider. The longer the coverage, the higher the caps to benefits, the shorter the wait or elimination period, and the greater the inflation protection, the higher the costs will be. To give you a ballpark sense (based on the 2019 American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance Price Index Survey), the average cost for an initial $164,000 pool of benefits (which could increase over time) for a 55-year old male would be about $2,000 per year; $2,700 per year for a female. Your circumstances will help you decide You shouldn\\'t buy LTC insurance if the premium will blow your budget. Period. A good guideline is that premiums shouldn\\'t be more than 7 percent of your income. If you don\\'t have much in savings, your only source of income is Social Security, or you\\'re on Medicaid, you shouldn\\'t buy a LTC insurance policy. At the other extreme, people with substantial assets who are confident they\\'ll be able to pay out of pocket for care needn\\'t purchase LTC insurance. A financial planner can help you make this assessment. If you\\'re in-between, you might be a good candidate for long-term care insurance if you\\'re in good health, can afford the costs (including possible premium increases), don\\'t want to use most or all of your assets and income to pay for long-term care, and don\\'t want to burden family or friends. It isn\\'t all or nothing If you don\\'t medically qualify or just can\\'t afford to purchase the amount of LTC coverage you might want, don\\'t despair. When it comes to paying for long-term care, there\\'s room to be creative. First, it may not be necessary to buy a policy to cover all potential LTC costs. For example, if a married couple only buys a policy for one spouse, they still have some protection in place. Alternatively, some LTC policies allow spouses to purchase a joint policy with a common pool of benefits, which may be more affordable. Second, some states offer special Medicaid asset exemptions for persons purchasing qualified LTC policies, known as \\'Partnership\\' policies. These policies can increase the amount of financial resources you can protect and still qualify for state LTC assistance. Finally, be sure to consider other resources you may have available. This can include family support such as help from an adult child or family member, community resources, health savings accounts (HSAs), home equity, pensions, Social Security, as well as other types of insurance. For example, while a LTC policy can serve to “shield” financial resources, a life insurance policy can “replace” financial assets to surviving beneficiaries, including a spouse. Ultimately, figuring out the best way to pay for potential long-term care can be complicated, so talk with your financial advisor and an insurance agent to understand your options. Be an informed shopper. A Shopper\\'s Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance is one great resource. And whether you ultimately decide to purchase LTC insurance or not, planning for long-term care costs is an important part of everyone\\'s overall financial plan. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'A reverse mortgage could help you \"age in place,\" but it\\'s essential to weigh the benefits, costs and risks.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My wife and I are in our 60s and looking at ways to reduce our expenses when we retire. We\\'ve considered downsizing, but after 27 years our house and the neighborhood still fit us. Our home is finally paid for and is pretty manageable except we worry about being able to pay for major repairs or healthcare in the future. Would a reverse mortgage make sense for us? —A Reader Dear Reader, I\\'m glad you asked this question because so many people are in exactly your situation, wanting to \"age in place\" rather than move to a smaller, less expensive home or a retirement community. But as you point out, maintaining a large home and paying for health care and other potential expenses can be challenging. Congratulations on paying off your mortgage; that\\'s a major accomplishment and will certainly help your budget. If you still find yourself short of cash, a home equity loan (HELOC) or a cash-out mortgage could be options, but both would require you to make monthly payments. And as you suggest, a reverse mortgage could also make sense, provided you understand exactly what you\\'re getting into and how it ties into your larger financial picture. On the plus side, a reverse mortgage will allow you to tap into a portion of your home\\'s equity without having to make monthly payments. On the downside, the fees and interest charges are typically higher than those for a cash-out refinance or HELOC. When combined with the amount of money you borrow, this can significantly erode the equity that you\\'ve built up in your home. Let\\'s go over more particulars so that you\\'ll be able to make an informed decision. Note: There are several kinds of reverse mortgage programs. I\\'m covering (and suggest that you only consider) what is known as Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) or \"heck-ums.\" That\\'s because HECMs are regulated and insured through the federal government by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Federal Housing Authority (FHA). Other types of reverse mortgages don\\'t have these protections. Reverse mortgage basics A reverse mortgage is a loan that uses your home as collateral. You can use the proceeds for anything from supplementing your income, to paying off other debt, to making a large purchase. Your house will remain in your name and the income you receive is tax-free since the money comes from a loan. In addition, no matter how much you owe on a reverse mortgage, you can\\'t owe more than the value of your home (even if the loan balance is larger). One of the biggest advantages of a reverse mortgage is that you\\'re not required to make payments as long as you remain in your home. However, once you leave your home for more than 12 months, sell it or die, the outstanding loan must be repaid along with any interest—typically from the sale of the home. Eligibility requirements Not just anyone can get a reverse mortgage. First, the youngest borrower must be at least 62. And the home must be your primary residence. You can\\'t take out a reverse mortgage on a second home or an investment property. You also must be able to demonstrate that you can maintain the property and pay property taxes, insurance, HOA fees, etc. And finally, you must own your home outright (or those who have a mortgage must pay it off with either the reverse mortgage proceeds or other funds before they can use the proceeds for anything else). How much you can borrow The amount you can borrow is dependent on your (and your spouse\\'s) ages, the value of your home, and interest rates. The older you are, the more equity you have, and the lower the interest rate environment, the larger the amount you can borrow. There\\'s a limit on how much you can take out the first year and an overall limit to how much of the value of the home you can borrow against. In 2022, the HECM FHA mortgage limit is $970,800. So even if your home is worth $3 million, the HECM will only let you borrow against $970,800 of its value. You would then be able to borrow anywhere from 35-75 percent of this amount, depending on your age, interest rates, and how much equity you have in the property. Unlocking different retirement strategies Once you have the loan, you can take the cash in a lump sum, a specified amount for a fixed number of years, monthly payments as long as you remain in the home (tenure), a standby line of credit to use when you wish or a combination of fixed or tenure payments with a line of credit. There are a variety of ways you can use a reverse mortgage to your advantage. For example, you could use it to build an income \"bridge\" in order to claim higher Social Security benefits later, protect against having to sell assets during a bear market, pay for taxes on Roth conversions, pay for home renovations, or even buy a new home. It\\'s not free money A reverse mortgage can carry costs of up to several thousand dollars and typically add up to be much higher than a conventional mortgage or HELOC. As a general rule, lenders will charge: 1) mortgage insurance premiums (initial and annual) 2) third-party charges 3) origination fee 4) interest and 5) servicing fees. You can either pay these fees upfront or by financing them over time from the proceeds of the loan. Financing these costs will lower the amount you can borrow and eat away at more of your home equity over time—leaving less to your estate. It\\'s important to understand that with a traditional mortgage you build equity over time. With a reverse mortgage, you deplete equity that you\\'ve build up over time. Some final thoughts Reverse mortgages have gone through a number of changes over the years. Early on they were often heavily marketed as a way to spend on luxuries or used by aggressive salespeople to cross-sell lucrative investment products. While these types of abuses still exist, there are now more safeguards. Today, before applying for a HECM, you\\'re required to meet with a counselor from an independent government-approved housing counseling agency. You can visit HUD to find a counselor, or call the agency at 1-800-569-4287. For the right individuals in the right situation, reverse mortgages can be a uniquely effective way to stay in your home during retirement. But it\\'s essential to think long term, weighing the benefits, costs and risks. What if one of you has a health issue? How will a reverse mortgage impact a plan to \\'leave the house to the kids?\" Or what if you just decide that your current home no longer suits your needs? Talk out all of these scenarios with your wife, your financial advisor, and possibly even your beneficiaries before you sign on the dotted line. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': \"A 401(k) offers a lot of benefits, match or no match. Here's what to think about before changing your contribution.\",\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My employer recently stopped offering a 401(k) match. I've always tried to contribute enough to get the entire match, but now I'm in a bit of a cash crunch and wonder if it makes sense to keep contributing. Is it still worth it? —A Reader Dear Reader, You've probably heard me say many times that specific financial advice depends a lot on your individual circumstances. And this is one of those questions that certainly fits that category. The pandemic has had a major economic impact on employers as well as individuals. According to a national survey by the Plan Sponsor Council of America, more than 20 percent of large organizations had already suspended matching 401(k) contributions as of April. So, you’re not alone and I’m quite sure millions of Americans are asking themselves the same question. To me, saving for retirement should be a universal priority. The beauty of a 401(k) is that it offers tax advantages and makes regular contributions seamless. Having a match on top of that is icing on the cake—but not having it doesn’t negate the other benefits. But here's where your own circumstances come in. When money is tight, you may have to rethink and reprioritize. You don't want to jeopardize your future, but you also don’t want to make imprudent decisions like racking up a huge credit card bill or defaulting on other commitments in order to continue contributing. On the other hand, if your budget still allows you to make regular contributions, you definitely should. In fact, as counter-intuitive as it may seem, now could be the time to increase your contribution to make up for the lost match. (It's possible you’ve been under contributing all along!) It's kind of a balancing act. So before you make a decision, there are a number of things to consider. Start with these questions While your present situation always impacts the way you plan for the future, in times like these you may need to take an even closer look. For instance: How stable is your job? When the company you work for, whether large or small, is looking at its balance sheet to find ways to economize, you want to be realistic about the future of that company. Are there layoffs ahead? A cutback in hours? If you think your position could be impacted, now's the time to make sure you have enough cash on hand to make it financially if your job situation changes. Which brings me to the next point. Do you have an adequate emergency fund? Today's uncertainties have brought the importance of emergency funds front and center. The standard recommendation to have enough cash easily accessible to cover three-to-six months essential expenses may even be an understatement. If your emergency fund is less than adequate, building it up should be a primary focus. Look at your budget. Can you redirect some dollars to this important fund? If there's no other way to do it, you could reassess how much you're currently contributing to your 401(k) in order to balance present financial stability with future security. Have your savings to date been adequate? A common employer match is 50 cents on the dollar for the first six percent of your salary. This means that if you’ve only been contributing up to the match, you’ve been contributing nine percent between you and your employer. That’s good, but below the 10-15 percent that I recommend for someone in their 20’s (an older person just beginning to save may need to contribute even more). If you're behind in your savings already, you’ll likely have to work even harder in the future to catch up. How close are you to retirement? This is a crucial question. If you're far from retirement, you may feel like you have plenty of time ahead to save. But the reality is that the earlier you start saving—and the more aggressively you save—the more time you have to benefit from potential market appreciation and compound growth. Stop saving now and you've lost the power of time. Conversely, if you're close to retirement and still have a way to go to meet your savings goal, every dollar you save now is essential. There’s more to it than the match While getting an employer match is a definite plus—and an opportunity you never want to pass up—there’s more to it than that. Yes, stopping contributions or temporarily reducing your percentage would put more dollars in your pocket and potentially help ease your cash crunch. On the other hand, it's a trade-off, not only in terms of your future security, but also your current tax situation. If you have a traditional 401(k), your contributions are tax-deductible, which lowers your taxable income. Decrease or completely stop those contributions and you potentially increase your tax liability. You also decrease your long-term, tax-deferred earnings potential. If you have a Roth 401(k), you don’t get an immediate tax benefit, but the ability to take tax-free withdrawals in the future is huge. It doesn't have to be all or nothing If you need some extra money now for essential expenses or to boost your emergency fund, reducing your contribution (rather than stopping it completely) could make sense in the short term. But promise yourself you'll recommit to saving more as soon as things turn around. Because match or no match, when it comes to long-term retirement saving, contributing as much as you can to a 401(k) is one of the best things you can do. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'Natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires and drought can have a major financial impact on the areas in which they occur.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Prior to Hurricane Laura making landfall in Louisiana and the wildfires in California and parts of the West igniting, the U.S. had already experienced 10 different billion-dollar natural disasters this year.1 The frequency and costs of major natural disasters have been rising over the past 40 years, and we think it\\'s a risk that municipal bond investors should pay attention to. Beyond the human toll, climate shocks have the potential to erode a municipality\\'s tax base, create economic disruptions, strain liquidity and impair assets, among other issues. We don\\'t believe that climate shocks pose a significant risk to the muni market as a whole, but they do pose a risk to some issuers—and that risk isn\\'t currently priced into the muni market, in our view. While we don\\'t want to minimize the human toll, and we\\'re well aware that climate change has become a hot-button issue, municipal bond investors can\\'t ignore the fact that natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and droughts can have a major financial impact on the areas in which they occur. Leaving aside the question of why the pace of natural disasters has been accelerating, we will take a look below at how climate and weather disasters may affect issuers in the municipal bond market. The number of natural disasters costing at least $1 billion has increased since 1980 Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), \"Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Overview\" (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/). Data as of 07/08/2020. Note: The annual average does not include 2020. Disasters historically haven’t affected the broad market Historically, most municipal issuers affected by natural disasters have been able to manage through the financial impact caused by the disaster. No state or local government rated by Moody\\'s Investors Service has defaulted on its bonds due to a natural disaster. However, downgrades are a possibility (when a bond is downgraded, its yield rises and its price generally falls). Natural disasters don\\'t appear to pose a risk to the broad muni market either. We haven\\'t seen yields rise across the board following past natural disasters. Higher yields would mean that muni investors, on average, are more concerned about the increased risks—but historically, yields have been relatively unchanged following a major natural disaster. The muni market has been resilient to past natural disasters Source: Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index, as of 8/27/2020 and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), \"Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Overview\" (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/), as of 07/08/2020. Yield to worst is a measure of the lowest possible yield that can be received on a bond that fully operates within the terms of its contract without defaulting. Smaller regional issuers are more at risk Although climate shocks haven\\'t posed a past risk to the broad muni market or to large issuers like states, we believe they could pose a risk to some smaller regional issuers in the future. When a climate shock occurs, like a hurricane, flood, or drought, it can result in damaged infrastructure, economic disruption, and outmigration, among other issues. All of these could lead to lower revenues, increased expenses, or a combination of both. Issuers with smaller tax or revenue bases are more at risk compared to issuers with broad revenue bases, like states. The muni market hasn’t priced in the risk of climate shocks, in our view Yields for muni bonds don\\'t appear to incorporate the risk of climate change yet. To illustrate, we compared some similarly rated airport system revenue bonds, maturing close to 30 years from now. They were from Denver; Broward County, Fla., which is on the eastern coast of Florida and includes Fort Lauderdale; Miami; Houston; and Chicago. The risk of a climate shock, such as a hurricane or flooding, over the next 30 years is arguably much greater for Broward County, Miami, or Houston than for Denver or Chicago. However, yields for all bonds were nearly identical. In other words, investors weren\\'t getting higher yields for the potential risk of climate shock in this scenario (caveat: These are just a few examples in a market that has $3.6 trillion bonds outstanding). Spreads for issuers more likely to be pressured by climate shocks are similar to issuers less likely to be affected Source: Bloomberg, as of 8/31/2020. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. What to do now We suggest the following steps for investors concerned about the impact climate change could have on municipalities: 1. Diversify by area When investing in individual bonds, we recommend holding at least 10 different issuers with differing credit risks. This includes issuers in different locations. As a reminder, we recommend that most investors in all states, other than New York and California, diversify nationally. 2. Choose areas that are less likely to be affected by climate changes and shocks It\\'s no surprise, but location matters. Areas like the Midwest are most likely to be affected by extreme heat whereas coastal areas are most likely to be affected by sea level rise. We don\\'t advocate avoiding issuers in these areas completely but be cognizant of the risks when you are looking at issuers there. 3. Focus on higher-rated issuers and do additional due diligence Historically, issuers with more financial flexibility—a quality that is often associated with higher credit ratings—have been better able to manage through the financial disruption of a climate shock. Muni issuers whose finances were already under pressure, which are usually already lower-rated, may be at risk of downgrades—and therefore price declines—because of the added strain. When a bond is downgraded, it reflects the opinion of the credit rating agency that the issuer has less financial flexibility to meet its debt service. For example, before Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, New Orleans had already been struggling financially and was rated BBB+ by S&P—near the low end of the investment-grade spectrum. The storm devastated the city and caused massive damage from which the city took years to recover. Immediately following Hurricane Katrina, S&P placed the city of New Orleans general obligation (GO) bonds and several area issuers on credit watch in expectation of a decline in revenues. Approximately two months after Katrina, S&P downgraded many New Orleans issuers, including the GO debt, to B – which is considered \"junk.\" The credit rating for the city\\'s GO bonds has since recovered to AA-, but it took eight years to do so. At the other end of the spectrum is Hurricane Sandy\\'s impact on New York City in 2012. Sandy was the fourth-costliest storm in U.S. history. Although there was substantial damage along the coastlines of New Jersey, New York, and other areas, there was little financial impact on New York City, the economic hub of the region. Due to the city\\'s already strong financial position, as indicated by its AA credit rating at the time, it could more easily respond to the negative impact from the storm. The city\\'s credit rating was unchanged following the storm. 4. Invest in issuers whose revenues are less impacted by climate shocks General obligation bonds, for example, tend to be backed by property or sales taxes and have historically been less financially impacted by climate shocks. Some revenue bonds, on the other hand, are more likely to be impacted by a climate shock. A revenue bond is a type of municipal bond issued by an entity that earns revenues from more business-like operations to pay their bonds back. An example would include a water and sewer facility, an airport, a college, or a not-for-profit hospital. Broadly speaking, we think that more business-like enterprises, like a health-care facility, airport, or toll road, are at a greater risk than a state government or local general obligation bond from the financial impacts caused by a natural disaster. If the disaster causes a slowdown in economic activity, revenues could decline for issuers in the affected areas. For example, following Hurricane Katrina, S&P lowered the rating on Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport\\'s general airport revenue bonds to BB from A because of a \"dramatic drop\" in passenger traffic and uncertainty regarding future demand for airline travel in the area. The airport\\'s credit rating has since recovered and the bond are rated A- by S&P. 5. Choose shorter-term bonds Since Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, the territory has lost roughly 4% of its population. Over time a declining population can result in a smaller tax base. Population trends often take years to develop so a focus on short-term munis can help reduce this risk. Be cautious with longer-term munis that are lower-rated and are in areas where climate shocks are probable. Unfortunately climate shocks, like hurricanes, floods, and fires, are likely to continue. However, muni investors can take steps to lessen the risk on their portfolios. Investing in a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that is well-diversified can help reduce the risk of a small number of issuers facing credit pressures due to a climate shock. Consequently, it most likely won’t have a large impact on the funds value. However, investors in individual bonds should take notice of the risks that climate shocks may pose as it\\'s generally hard to achieve adequate diversification for every dollar invested using individual bonds.

       "   'abstract': 'A new survey finds that Americans see financial literacy as part of the solution to some of the country’s biggest social issues.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, Today, I’d like to turn the tables and ask you a question: Let’s say you could design a basic high school curriculum. Outside of core courses like Science, Math, and English, how would you rank adding financial literacy as a requirement—as compared to other topics such as health and wellness, career development and college planning, arts and music, and sports? This is just one of many questions that my team and I recently posed to thousands of Americans through a national poll. If you put financial literacy at the top of your list, you’re in agreement with 63 percent of our respondents. Let me back up a minute. We first fielded our poll in February with the goal of assessing the importance of financial education in today’s world. Of course, at that time we had no idea of the health crisis that was about to upend just about every aspect of our lives. Therefore, a few months later in June, concerned that the pandemic might change the results, we repeated several key questions. Somewhat to our surprise, the results stayed the same. Even in the midst of a global health crisis, the majority of Americans expressed the same sense of urgency for improved financial literacy, even prioritizing financial education over health and wellness education. Looking deeper, we also asked our survey participants to reflect on their personal money habits, the role that financial literacy plays in society, and their thoughts on how we can improve our national financial IQ. Let’s take a closer look at what we learned—and how we can use these insights to create a more financially secure future for all Americans. Too many Americans are living on the edge For me, the most unsettling finding in our survey was that half of our respondents said they would face financial hardship if they had to cover an emergency expense of $1,000 in the next 30 days (and one-third would struggle to come up with $500). This is consistent with previous studies, most notably one done in 2019 by the Federal Reserve. As troubling as this sounds on the surface, the reality is even more serious. The implications of not being able to pay for an emergency—from possibly avoiding medical treatment to eviction or even having to drop out of school—can be devastating and long lasting. Perhaps because of this acute vulnerability, the majority of our respondents also said they wished they had learned about the value of saving money at a younger age. If they could turn back the clock, they said they would also teach their younger selves basic money management, how to set and work towards financial goals, and how to invest. When asked about the future, the majority believe that teaching the next generation personal finance basics will better prepare them to face the unexpected and will have a positive impact for years to come. A lack of financial literacy contributes to social inequalities Another powerful statistic we uncovered is that 89 percent of our respondents believe a lack of financial literacy contributes to larger social issues—from poverty, to fewer job opportunities, to wealth and gender inequality. I agree—100 percent. The need for financial literacy is especially urgent for women and minorities, who continue to face unique challenges at home and in the workplace. Yes, we've made some strides. But for the most vulnerable segments of our society, increased financial stability, improved confidence in financial decision-making and expanded opportunities would be a life changer—impacting everything from getting a college education, to supporting a family, to following a chosen career, to starting a business. Financial literacy isn’t a cure-all, but it is an essential key to unlocking doors to opportunity and financial security. Americans are looking to our schools I've been advocating for more financial education in our schools for two decades, and our survey respondents overwhelmingly agree. When asked who (outside of family) should have the primary role in providing financial education, two-thirds of our respondents said our schools. When you think about it, it just makes sense, but currently only 21 states mandate some degree of financial education in their schools. This is helpful for these more fortunate students, but the reality is that every child in America should be taught the fundamentals of money management including budgeting, saving, and investing. To do any less, in my opinion, is nothing short of neglect. We must all be part of the solution When I look back to February when we first fielded our poll, that pre-pandemic world seems like a completely different universe. But now that our vulnerabilities have been so dramatically exposed, it's time for all of us to do whatever it takes to improve our individual and national financial health. Parents, talk openly and honestly with your kids about your financial challenges and successes. Teach your kids to live below their means so they can save for an emergency and for the future. Educators, fight for more teacher training and financial literacy courses in your schools. Employers, incentivize your employees to save for their retirement, and for a rainy day. Elected officials and community leaders, recognize that Americans are hungry for more financial knowledge so that they can make better choices and face the future with confidence and independence. We need sustained leadership and increased partnerships at all levels to advance financial literacy efforts. And perhaps most importantly, every single one of us needs to continue in our individual quests to learn more about how to manage our money. Life evolves, emergencies happen, and the world changes. It's up to all of us to secure our financial future, for ourselves, our families, and future generations. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': \"In spite of significant gains in education and employment, women still aren't investing aggressively enough. Why?\",\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, Women's Equality Day is celebrated on August 26th and this year it has a special meaning. It marks the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which gave women in the U.S. the right to vote. This important achievement opened the door to other opportunities, and we’re now outpacing men in college and advanced degrees, we comprise 47 percent of the workforce, we’re entering previously male-dominated fields and we’re getting elected to public office at unprecedented rates. But in spite of all this improvement, there's at least one area where we still lag behind men—investing. And to me, this is a lost opportunity with long-term consequences. How women are still financially behind A 2018 Schwab financial literacy survey of the money attitudes of young adults demonstrated that young women were half as likely as young men to have an investment account. That's not to say the women weren't interested in finances. They worked several jobs, saved, paid off debt and saw the importance of a financial plan. They just didn't invest. So why is this? A famous study conducted in the late 90s by Brad M. Barber and Terrance Odean concluded that, even though women had many traits that would make them good investors, they were far less confident than men in their investing ability. Data from several studies over the years show that even when women have investment accounts, they hold the majority of their money in more conservative holdings like bonds and cash. Is this just a crisis of confidence or is something else working here? Why women need to start investing now There are lots of statistics about the gender pay gap worldwide. And in the U.S., women still only earn 82 cents to a man's dollar. Plus, it's well acknowledged that women, on average, outlive men. So the importance of saving and investing to help make up for this deficit is obvious. Earning fewer dollars means women need to save and invest even more. Living longer requires even more retirement savings to not outlive your money. To me, the solution is to get women not only to invest—but also to invest more aggressively when appropriate. The question is how? What we can do about it—together and individually Like so many things, I believe it comes down to taking the mystery out of investing. Often the more we know about something, the less intimidating it is. So for those of us in positions to support financial education—financial planners, educators, employers and parents—the first line of offense is to get the information out there. Start by helping women and girls understand the basics. Encourage them to think about their goals and put market risk in the context of long-term market opportunity. If appropriate, you might even help someone open an account and choose initial investments. And everyone can help themselves by taking these crucial steps: Begin with an emergency fund. The first step to financial security is having enough cash in a savings account to cover at least three to six months’ worth of unexpected expenses. This fund will not only help you in case of an emergency, but can also give you the confidence to start investing and help weather a market downturn. Look to retirement. Whether you're in your 20s or your 40s, you can't afford to wait to start saving for retirement. And even though women are known to put others’ needs first, when it comes to retirement, you have to think of yourself. Take full advantage of a company retirement plan like a 401(k). In fact, this is a great way to begin investing. Contribute at least up to the company match, more if possible. Don't have a company plan? Consider an IRA. The point is to save as much as you can as soon as you can. Living to 90-plus is becoming more common. You need to be prepared. Invest in stocks. Your first thought may be that you don't want to take the risk. Market downturns definitely happen as we've recently seen, but being too cautious can also put you at a disadvantage. Stocks are an important part of any portfolio because of their long term potential for growth and higher potential returns versus other investments like cash or bonds. Here's a statistic I mentioned in a previous column: from 1926 to 2019, a dollar kept in cash investments would only be worth $22 today; that same dollar invested in small-cap stocks would be worth $25,688 today.1 So where to begin? Many broad-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds make it easy to invest in a cross-section of stocks. An index fund or target-date fund can make it even easier. Using a robo advisor can also be a good way to begin. You don't have to know a lot to start; you just need to know where to start. Plan for other financial goals. What are your other goals—a down payment on a home, a child's education or a vacation? Investing a portion of your savings in stocks may help you reach those goals faster with the caveat that money you think you'll need in three to five years should be in less risky investments. Stock investing should ideally be long-term, understanding how much risk you can stomach, and how much risk you can afford to take. Ask for help and advice. When you have questions, ask your benefits administrator, your broker, even a knowledgeable friend or family member—but ask. There are also lots of online investing resources to explore. Need more? Consider working with a financial advisor. A financial advisor is sort of like a personal trainer, someone to guide you and keep you going when you might otherwise be tempted to call it quits. He or she should understand your feelings, situation, and goals. Never hesitate to ask questions, including how your advisor is paid. No time like the present Time is a crucial factor in investing. If you have many years ahead of you to invest—and you commit to keeping your money invested—time will likely help you weather the inevitable market ups and downs. That's not to say you can't start investing later in life. But, again, I want to stress that money you'll need in the short-term shouldn't be in the stock market. That said, I encourage everyone—not just women—to make the most of their hard-earned savings and build financial independence through investing. It doesn't take a lot of money; it just takes getting started. And there's no time like the present. 1Schwab Center for Financial Research.

       "   'content': 'Market shocks are an inevitable part of investing—but that doesn\\'t make them any easier to stomach. Whether you\\'re just starting out or you\\'ve been saving for decades, watching your hard-earned gains evaporate overnight can cause you to question the entire enterprise. \"When the market is going up and up, it\\'s easy for investors to think they\\'re more comfortable with risk than they actually are,\" says Mark Riepe, head of the Schwab Center for Financial Research. \"But the S&P 500® Index\\'s recent drop into bear-market territory may have forced people to confront their true risk tolerance.\" So, how do you go about reassessing your tolerance for risk, come what may? Ask yourself these three questions. 1. How much can I stand to lose emotionally? Investing is an act of faith—to say nothing of willpower. The assets that offer the highest potential reward are often the riskiest, but if you can steel yourself against occasional surges in volatility, you\\'re more likely to reach your long-term goals. The question is, how much risk can you really handle? To help answer that question, consider the downsides and upsides of five hypothetical portfolios: More pain, more potential gain Consider five hypothetical $25,000 portfolios–from conservative (smallest allocation to stocks) to aggressive (largest allocation to stocks). The greater the allocation to stocks, the greater the potential downside . . . but also the greater potential upside. After 40 years, the portfolios with greater stock allocations had significantly larger values than those with smaller allocations. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research.

The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to represent a specific investment product. Historical returns are weighted averages of the performances of the indexes used to represent each asset class, include the reinvestment of dividends and interest, and are rebalanced annually. The example does not reflect the effects of taxes or fees. The indexes representing each asset class are: S&P 500® Index (large-cap stocks); Russell 2000® Index (small-cap stocks); MSCI EAFE Index (international stocks); Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (fixed income); and FTSE 3-Month Treasury Bill (cash investments). Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Although portfolios with larger allocations to stocks delivered higher returns over time, they were also more volatile—which may not work for everyone. If you need the money in the next few years, for example, you should choose a more stable investment mix. The same is true if you simply can\\'t bear to see your portfolio plummet in value. \"It\\'s perfectly reasonable to say, \\'I\\'m willing to accept lower returns in exchange for more stability,\\'\" Mark says. \"But that means you may have to save more—or ratchet back your spending expectations—to compensate.\" Indeed, reducing your exposure to stocks and other relatively high-risk, high-reward assets during your peak earning years comes with its own kind of risk: falling short of your goal. \"Market turbulence feels risky because it\\'s something you have to face again and again,\" Mark says. \"But the more pernicious risk comes from undercutting your long-term returns because there\\'s often no coming back from that.\" To help manage your emotional response to market volatility, consider cutting back on how often you review the performance of your long-term accounts. In fact, research suggests that the less often people check their investments, the more risk they may be willing to take—and the better their returns are likely to be over time: Less is more In one study, in 1997, participants who received yearly feedback on the performance of their hypothetical portfolios had a higher risk tolerance than those who received monthly feedback. Source: Richard Thaler, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman, and Alan Schwartz, \"The Effect of Myopia and Loss Aversion on Risk Taking: An Experimental Test,\" The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 05/01/1997. Additional research also found that receiving price information less frequently led to professional traders (in a highly realistic experimental setting) investing 33% more in risky assets, which resulted in 53% higher profits than traders who relied on constant updates.1 \"You can\\'t wish your emotions away,\" Mark says, \"but you can take steps to keep them in check.\" That said, there may be reasons to review your portfolio more often. \"You should check in on your investments and your broader financial plan anytime your situation changes substantially.\" 2. How much can I stand to lose financially? While many people think about risk in terms of their ability to endure losses emotionally, there\\'s another component to risk that\\'s equally important: your capacity to recover financially. \"Time is a big factor here,\" Mark says. \"When you\\'ve got a decade or more until you need to tap your savings, short-term volatility isn\\'t a big risk. But if you\\'ll need the money in, say, five or fewer years, a market downturn can be devastating.\" Be that as it may, your financial capacity for risk may not square with your emotional tolerance for it. An investor in his 40s, for example, probably has 20 or more years until retirement, which should allow him to invest aggressively. But some people simply can\\'t tolerate the ups and downs of holding that much stock, regardless of their age or time frame. Conversely, even aggressive investors can be waylaid by adverse life events like losing a job. \"If you need to tap your long-term savings to help make ends meet, your capacity for risk can shrink overnight,\" Mark says. \"In such situations, downshifting your risk exposure to help preserve capital could absolutely be the right approach.\" Of course, in a perfect world your financial plan would have a built-in cushion for such emergencies. For example, Schwab recommends having at least three (and ideally six) months\\' worth of essential expenses saved in a highly liquid account. \"The COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated how quickly things can take a turn for the worse,\" Mark says. \"With an emergency fund in place, you\\'re less likely to need to tap your long-term investments to cover short-term expenses.\" If you\\'re nearing or in retirement, however, your emergency fund should be large enough to cover at least a year\\'s worth of expenses, with another two to four years\\' worth saved in relatively liquid investments. \"Keeping that much cash on hand will help you avoid having to sell assets during a downturn,\" Mark says. 3. How well do I know myself? \"Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom,\" wrote Aristotle. Unfortunately, human beings are notoriously bad at predicting in advance how they\\'ll actually respond to a given set of conditions. That\\'s why Mark recommends asking someone close to you to rate your risk tolerance. \"You might think you\\'re comfortable with risk, but your spouse or a close friend may be able to identify patterns of behavior—such as your tendency to play it safe in other areas of your life—that you\\'re unable to recognize in yourself.\" Financial advisors are ideally suited to this role because their experience with a broad range of clients can lend some perspective on where you fall along the spectrum of risk tolerance. As they get to know you, they may also be able to help you identify whether you\\'re acting with your head—or your heart. \"An advisor can help curtail the emotional responses that might otherwise get the best of you,\" Mark says. Sleep easier In the end, figuring out how much risk you can really handle is an art as much as it is a science. \"Sure, we can give you guidelines based on your age or time frame, but it ultimately comes down to how much you can stand to lose—both emotionally and financially,\" Mark says. \"Once you know that, you can put together a plan that balances your long-term need for growth with your near-term need to sleep at night.\" 1Francis Larson, John A. List, and Robert D. Metcalfe, \"Can Myopic Loss Aversion Explain the Equity Premium Puzzle?

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I'm concerned that my son is in a financially abusive relationship. Because his fiancée claims to be better with money, she manages all their finances, including his salary, and controls their accounts. As a result, he's totally reliant on her for anything he wants, even spending money. I don't see this as healthy. I worry that she's purposely keeping him dependent on her. Am I being overly concerned? —A Reader Dear Reader, You're absolutely right to be concerned. While it can make sense for one partner in a couple to take the lead in managing finances, allowing someone to take total control is another matter. And over time, that control could turn into an abusive situation with long-term consequences. There's a growing awareness of financial abuse and a realization that it's not uncommon. According to a 2017 survey of millennials by Centsai, an online financial wellness community, 68 percent of female respondents said they'd been a victim of financial abuse. What may come as a surprise is that 40 percent of male respondents also said they had suffered financial abuse. And it can go beyond money. Many people don’t recognize financial abuse as a form of domestic violence. But in fact, nearly all victims of physical domestic abuse report that their partner also uses financial control as a weapon. In fact, financial dependence is one of the main reasons many victims don’t leave an abusive relationship. So while your son may not express his own concerns about this situation, I would encourage you to bring up your reservations, and perhaps offer him some insight into healthy ways for couples to manage their money together. Here's some perspective to help you. Financial abuse can be subtle and come in many guises It’s not just fraud or theft. Financial abuse can happen when someone takes complete charge of another person's finances, as in your son's situation. What can initially seem like a simple matter of practicality could turn into a power play to control the other's behavior. Often when the abuse is gradual, it can be harder to recognize. Hiding purchases or taking small amounts of money over time are common tactics that are easily overlooked. But it can grow into more overt actions like forging checks, opening credit cards without the other person's knowledge, hiding or withholding money, and using money as a form of manipulation and intimidation. Other forms of abuse may affect a victim’s ability to work by blocking access to a car or interfering with a job. It can destroy assets, credit—and confidence On the financial side, financial abuse can have devastating and long-lasting consequences. Investment losses or damaged credit can take years to rebuild. If lawyers need to be involved, it can add thousands of dollars and take more time to resolve. Emotionally, the effects of financial abuse can lead to depression and anxiety, ultimately making it even more difficult for the victim to regain their financial independence and long-term security. Fear of embarrassment or fear of additional abuse often makes victims reluctant to get help on their own, prolonging the situation. It's not just about couples As I mentioned, financial abuse can impact men and women alike. And it's not just couples that need to be aware. While young millennials are more commonly targeted in new intimate relationships or friendships, senior citizens are especially vulnerable to having a relative, friend or caregiver steal money. And don’t think that being in a certain occupation or having a certain level of education or income makes one immune. It occurs in all work situations and all economic levels—from members of the military to teachers to physicians—and in all areas of the country. Start a conversation—the sooner the better With this information in mind, bring up the subject with your son without questioning his fiancée's motives. Tell him you're concerned because if they're planning a future together, it's important that they're on the same page financially. For instance, have they talked about their mutual goals and how they're saving for them? Is he comfortable with how she's managing their money and does he share in the decision-making? Does he have their account numbers and easy access online to the accounts? Be sure he's aware that his retirement saving is up to him, and discuss whether he's contributing to a 401(k) or IRA. It may be that your son just lacks the knowledge and information to team up with his fiancée financially. A difference in financial literacy isn't uncommon in couples, but getting both partners on the same page can actually bring them closer. To help, start by sharing your own financial knowledge with your son and point him to some online resources that might give him the basic information he needs to start a conversation with his fiancée about their money. Her response to his interest in knowing more about their finances could be telling. Emphasize the importance of financial independence To me, it's important for each partner in a relationship to have a certain amount of financial independence. It's equally important for every couple contemplating marriage to have open and honest conversations about their personal values, which will impact their long-term financial goals as well as their day-to-day money management. A healthy financial relationship isn't so much about who pays the bills and who does the investing. There's no right or wrong way to share the financial responsibilities. But it's absolutely essential that each partner understand where the money is and have equal access to it. A situation in which one partner is controlling everything and keeping the other in the dark is concerning and possibly dangerous.

       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, In early March, the COVID-19 pandemic brought the 11-year bull market to a crashing halt. Since that time, the markets have recovered and then some but have been plagued with extreme volatility, leaving individual investors frightened and confused. While every investor knows that risk comes with the territory, the recent wild gyrations are enough to make even the hardiest investors feel unsure. So it comes as no surprise that I’m getting a lot of questions about how to protect a portfolio. People want to know if the standard advice has changed. The good news is that even though some points of execution have been fine-tuned, the fundamental principles of asset allocation and diversification remain the best ways to control risk. Let’s take a look. Asset allocation and diversification: Still the best investment strategy Asset allocation and diversification seem pretty similar and a lot of folks confuse the two, but they\\'re actually quite different. A key to creating a sound investment portfolio is to understand that difference and how the two work together. Asset allocation is the way you divide your money among major investment categories like stocks, bonds, cash and other types of investments, some of which are riskier than others. Therefore, this division into the various asset classes should be based on how much risk you\\'re comfortable taking and how soon you\\'ll need your money. While stocks have the highest return potential, they also carry the highest short-term risk. Cash, on the other hand, has the lowest return potential, but the least amount of short-term risk. Bonds are somewhere in between. Any money you\\'ll need within the next three to five years should be kept in lower risk investments. Asset allocation was first introduced as a way to manage risk in the 1950s. Research showed that a portfolio\\'s overall risk and expected return was a result of how each underlying investment performed individually as well as how investments behaved together. By choosing a variety of investments that react differently to market conditions—or those that have a low correlation to each other—an investor could reduce overall risk. Diversification takes this concept a step further by spreading your money between different types of investments within each asset class. For instance, instead of one stock or bond, ideally you would have many. Dividing even further, you should have different types of stocks, such as large cap, small cap and international. And within those divisions, you can diversify further by investing in different sectors (i.e., technology, healthcare, telecommunications) and different industries within the sectors. In the case of bonds, you can diversify within government, government agency, corporate, international, and high yield (“junk”) bonds of different maturities. Your ultimate goal is to find investments that don’t move lock-step with one another. That way, when one investment goes through a rough patch, another will hopefully compensate. You might say that asset allocation lays the foundation for your portfolio, and diversification builds the floors and rooms. With the two working together, you have greater opportunity for your investments to perform differently under various market conditions. One investment might go up when the other goes down—and balance your risk. Adapting to changing market realities So what, if anything, has changed? As first became apparent during the Great Recession of 2008, globalization has made markets more susceptible to external shocks, causing increased volatility and stronger correlations between asset classes. This surprised investors who had expected different asset classes they held to zig while others zagged and instead experienced that as asset classes zigged, the others would zig too—or zagged by a much smaller amount. This doesn’t mean, however, that diversification and asset allocation didn’t work; they just didn’t provide the level of protection that one would have hoped for. If anything, this experience shows us that we need asset allocation and diversification more than ever. Market volatility only reinforces their importance. The relatively new availability of low-cost \"non-traditional\" asset classes can help. Investments like real estate (real estate investment trusts or REITs), commodities (energy, agriculture, precious metals), Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and international bonds have historically had low correlation to traditional asset classes—moving differently in different markets—so adding small amounts to your portfolio can increase your diversification, potentially lowering your investment risk over time. The exact amount you use depends on your situation and investment preferences. Diversification can’t always protect you against short term market declines, but it historically has been a great defense against long periods of poor returns which can be more destructive. It remains a great strategy. How to stay on top of it all But you can’t stop there. Once you\\'ve built your well-diversified portfolio, it\\'s also essential to stay involved. In general, it’s smart to review your portfolio and rebalance at least yearly to stay within your target mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon—but in times of extreme volatility, you might want to do this more frequently, perhaps quarterly. Alternatively, you can rebalance when your investments fall outside of 5 percent of your target allocation. And while it\\'s never a good idea to try to time the market, it can make sense for some investors to make small changes to their portfolio to attempt to either take advantage of market opportunities or minimize losses. This doesn’t mean that you\\'d move in and out of the market all together, but rather rebalance and make small shifts to respond to changing market conditions. There\\'s a lot to think about, yes, but bottom line, asset allocation and diversification remain essential tools for protecting your portfolio. The more broadly you diversify, perhaps with the addition of new types of investments, the more you can potentially reduce risk.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I recently inherited a traditional IRA from my father. Can I cash out just some of the money if I need it, or do I have to take it all out now? —A Reader Dear Reader, I’m sorry to hear of your loss. As I’m sure you know, an inheritance can bring up conflicting emotions, placing the positive of financial gain against the sadness of losing a loved one. Complicating the situation further, certain inheritances—such as an IRA—are more difficult to sort out than others. In addition, changes under the SECURE Act passed in 2019 mean new options beginning in 2020. A beneficiary’s relationship to the deceased and when he or she inherited the IRA will determine exactly what those options are. Spouse versus non-spouse beneficiaries The first thing to understand is that IRA inheritance rules differ depending on whether the beneficiary is a spouse or non-spouse. A spouse has almost limitless options, including treating an inherited IRA as his or her own, even to the extent of converting it to a Roth. A non-spouse beneficiary like yourself, however, generally has much more limited choices. As a non-spouse, you can either take the IRA money in a lump sum or, in some cases, as required minimum distributions (or a combination of both). Required minimum distributions for inherited assets before 2020 For retirement accounts inherited by a non-spouse before 2020, the proceeds can be distributed over your lifetime (often referred to as “stretch IRAs”). Taking mandatory withdrawals over time can ease your tax burden, but the process is a bit more complicated than taking a lump sum. The first thing you have to do is open an inherited IRA in the name of the original account holder for your benefit. Just like the original account holder, you won't be taxed on the assets until you take a distribution, so your tax hit is spread out. There is no 10 percent penalty for early withdrawals. After that, you may have one more choice to make depending on your father’s age when he passed away. Here, in a nutshell, are your options: If your father was under 70½ when he died, you have two options for taking distributions: The Life Expectancy method, in which you must take an annual required minimum distribution (RMD) spread over your own life expectancy, based on IRS life-expectancy tables and determined by your age in the calendar year following the year of your father’s death. Distributions must begin no later than December 31 of the year after the year of death, and will be reevaluated each year. Of course, you can always take more than the RMD if you wish. The Five-Year method, which allows you to take distributions of any amount at any time up until December 31 of the fifth year after the year your father died, at which time all assets must be fully distributed. If your father was over 70½, you must use method number one, the Life Expectancy method. The five-year option doesn't apply. And one more thing: with the Life Expectancy method, if your father didn't take an RMD in the year of his death, you must take an RMD by December 31 of that year. Note that the new rules under the SECURE Act do not affect existing inherited accounts. They only apply to accounts that are inherited in 2020 and beyond. Required minimum distributions for inherited assets after 2020 Under the new SECURE Act, retirement assets must be distributed within ten years if the IRA owner died on or after January 1, 2020. In other words, you can take all or part or none any given year, as long as it’s all distributed by 10 years. However, there are exceptions for spouses, minor children, disabled individuals and persons less than ten years younger than the decedent. These individuals—sometimes referred to as ‘eligible designated beneficiaries’—can still withdraw or “stretch” out funds on the basis of life expectancy allowing them to defer distributions from inherited retirement accounts for a longer period of time. (Once minors reach the age of majority he or she will need to distribute the entire account within 10 years.) The age of the decedent when he or she died doesn’t matter. If you take the assets as a lump sum As I mentioned, as a non-spouse, you can take the assets all at once. The upside is that you have access to all the money right away, and there's no 10 percent penalty for early withdrawals. The downside is that you'll have to pay income tax on the distribution at your ordinary income tax rate, which could be quite a sum depending on the amount of the inheritance. Another concern is that the distribution itself could bump you into a higher tax bracket, increasing the amount of taxes you have to pay. Therefore, a lump sum may not be the most tax- efficient way to access the assets. Looking at the positive As you can see, there's a lot to think about. I suggest talking to your tax advisor before making a choice. You could also consult IRS Publication 590, which goes into greater detail on all aspects of IRA withdrawals. While the rules are complex, taking mandatory withdrawals under even an accelerated ten-year time table does have its benefits. For one, the undistributed assets can keep growing tax-deferred—which can be a significant boost over time. This choice also allows you to manage the assets according to your own goals and time horizon. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, If I asked you to rate your financial know-how on a scale of 1-7 (with 7 being the highest) where would you place yourself? If you're like the Americans who participated in the 2018 FINRA National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), you'd probably give yourself a pretty high score. In that study, 76 percent of respondents placed themselves in the 5-7 range. But self-perception is one thing; reality is another. Because the same study found that only 34 percent could correctly answer at least four of five basic financial literacy questions on topics such as mortgages, interest rates, inflation and risk. Curious about your own answers? Why not take the Financial Literacy Quiz now? It not only gives you an immediate score, it also shows you how you compare to others in your state. But whether the quiz confirms your knowledge or serves as a personal wake-up call, the generally low results of the NFCS definitely demonstrate the need to improve financial literacy in our country. Financial literacy: It's more than just math I think the Financial Literacy Quiz is a good starting point because it deals with everyday money situations. Whether you're putting money in a savings account, carrying a balance on a credit card or considering taking out a student loan, you need to understand how compound interest works—either for you or against you. When you're budgeting for the future, you need to be aware of how inflation can lower your buying power. If you're choosing between a 15- or 30-year mortgage, it's important to consider not only your monthly payment, but also the interest you'll pay over the life of the loan. Investing for the future? You have to understand the relationship between risk and return and how to choose investments accordingly. It isn't just learning how the numbers work. Real financial literacy means understanding the concepts that are fundamental to good decision-making. It can help people stay out of debt, plan and save for the future, and make wiser investing choices. And it doesn't stop with doing well on a quiz. Financial literacy is a skill that involves taking positive actions, and that continues to evolve along with our lives. It's not just for kids We often focus on kids when talking about financial literacy and recent financial literacy scores from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) demonstrate why: American students' scores remain just average compared to their peers worldwide, and we performed worse than Estonia, Finland, Canada, Poland and Australia. Average isn’t good enough in a globalized economy and increasingly complex financial landscape. We need to do better. As you may know, I'm a strong advocate for teaching young people financial concepts at an early age. And I'm encouraged that the number of states that require high school students to take a course in personal finance is growing (currently 21). But while kids definitely need to be taught personal finance early on, the need for basic financial literacy extends to everyone regardless of their age or life stage. Everyday, as technology changes and the types of financial products expand, people of all ages and walks of life are met with new and different financial situations. From shopping for a car or home to saving for retirement to planning for healthcare, individuals now face more complex financial decisions, and need to be sufficiently financially literate to take the necessary steps to protect themselves and their loved ones. Let's face it; there's a lot at stake. Whether you're signing up for employee benefits, managing student loans or deciding when to take Social Security, you want to know what you're doing. A little financial education goes a long way The good news is that there's tangible proof that financial education works. According to the 2018 NFCS, nearly half of Americans (49 percent) who have received more than 10 hours of financial education report spending less than they earn, compared with 36 percent of people who received less than 10 hours of financial education. Research from the 2020 Council of Economic Education Survey of the States shows that students who receive financial education borrow more sensibly, from student and personal loans to credit cards. Results from the PISA assessment show that young people and adults in both developed and emerging economies who have been exposed to high quality financial education are more likely than others to plan ahead, save and engage in other responsible financial behaviors. And in my personal experience with the Boys & Girls Clubs, kids who take the Money Matters course not only make better money decisions, they have more confidence and greater hope for the future. Let's improve all our scores Whatever your own scores on the Financial Literacy Quiz, whether you're a parent, a teacher, an employer or a concerned member of your community, there are things you can do to help promote financial education for everyone. For instance, the Global Financial Literacy Center offers FastLane, with practical ideas and action plans for groups and individuals. On CheckYourSchool.org, you can find out if the schools in your area offer financial education and how you can start or reinforce local financial literacy programs. DonorsChoose offers Lesson Plans & Activities for Educators created by teachers in the field, for teachers. There's a growing global awareness that financial literacy is an essential life skill that means not only greater prosperity, but better choices, increased confidence, and the ability to more successfully handle real-life financial challenges. Ultimately, it means a better, more just world. I hope you'll join me in taking action to support financial education—for yourself and for all of us. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': \"Note: Due to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, required minimum distributions (RMDs) for IRAs were waived for 2020. Learn about the RMD waiver > Dear Carrie, I turn 70 this year and am working part-time. I don’t necessarily need the income but I like my work and it gives me money to spend on a few “extras.” I have a few dollars left over each month and recently read that I can still contribute to an IRA. With required minimum distributions around the corner and tax season here, I’m wondering if this is a good idea? —A Reader Dear Reader, According to a recent GALLUP survey, 63% of Americans plan on working part-time in retirement. And I think that makes a lot of sense. After all, working part-time not only provides some extra income, it’s also a way to stay active and engaged. To my mind, it’s an ideal scenario. As you point out, the new SECURE Act has changed how you can treat your savings after age 70. Another change is the start date for required minimum distributions (RMDs). Let’s review the RMD rules first, then take a look at the various accounts you can use for savings, beginning with IRAs, and then also look at employer plans and taxable accounts. New RMD rules Since you won’t turn 70½ until 2020, you fall under the new SECURE Act rules. You must take your first RMD by April 1st of the year after you reach 72. For all subsequent years, you must take the RMD by December 31st of the year. This includes the year in which you were paid the first RMD. In other words, you would also be on the hook for the current year’s RMD by waiting until April 1st of the following year to take your first RMD—a double hit. This age 72 requirement is for most retirement accounts, including traditional IRAs, SEP and SIMPLE IRAs, and qualified plans such as a 401k, 403b, and 457. Roth IRAs remain exempt. More on this below. However, others who turned age 70½ in 2019 or earlier still fall under the old pre-SECURE Act RMD rules. (According to those rules, you could defer your first RMD until April 1st of the year after the year in which you turned 70½.) Whichever rules you fall under, it is important to pay attention because the penalty for not complying with RMDs is stiff: 50 percent of the amount that should have been withdrawn. Traditional IRAs Under the new SECURE Act if you have earned income, there's no age cap for contributing to a traditional IRA (previously you had to stop the year you turned age 70½). This change puts traditional IRAs on par with Roth IRAs, which never had an age cut-off. However, contributions you make to a traditional IRA may or may not be deductible. The amount you can deduct may be limited if you or your spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work and your income exceeds certain levels. If neither you nor a spouse is covered by an employer's retirement plan, you can deduct the full amount. If you aren’t able to deduct contributions to a traditional IRA, contributing to a Roth may make more sense, assuming you fall under the income limits. Keep in mind that those who are 70½ or older and making contributions to a traditional IRA, SIMPLE IRA or SEP IRA will still need to take RMDs, even if they’re still working. Does it make sense to contribute to an IRA while being subject to RMDs? In short, yes. This is because RMDs require you to withdraw only a portion of these accounts. By contributing to your IRA, you're effectively replenishing your retirement savings. If you can deduct the IRA contribution, you also offset some of the tax hit from taking RMDs. Employer retirement plans If you’re working after age 70½ you won’t need to take an RMD from a 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b) account until you leave that employer. This can be a convenient way to save and defer taking RMDs. Expanded eligibility rules under the SECURE Act also make it easier for employers to enroll long-term part-time employees into their retirement plan. Many employers also offer post-tax Roth 401(k)/403(b)/457(b) plans, which can be a great option. Nonetheless, keep in mind that unlike Roth IRAs, these plans are subject to RMDs if you aren’t working (in accordance with the age cut-offs discussed above). Roth IRAs If you’re working only part-time and you meet certain eligibility requirements, a Roth IRA can be a great option. You can continue to contribute indefinitely, and because Roth IRAs aren't subject to RMDs, your savings can accumulate tax-free for longer. Taxable Accounts Remember that you can always invest in a taxable brokerage account no matter your age—whether you have earned income or not. While taxable accounts don’t offer tax deductibility like traditional IRAs, aren’t tax deferred, and don’t offer the potential for tax-free earnings like a Roth, taxable accounts are eligible for 0-20 percent long-term capital gains rates—which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates. There’s also no RMD with a taxable account. I think working part-time and continuing to save can be a winning strategy for both your financial and physical health in retirement. The extra income can help improve your lifestyle and the extra savings can help better prepare you for the unexpected. It’s never too late to save more! And now, thanks to the SECURE Act, you have more options than ever. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I have money sitting in a low-interest savings account that I've been planning to invest but I keep procrastinating. Should I take the plunge now or wait to see if the market falls more? I understand the concept of buying low but it makes me nervous to invest so much now if the markets go down more. —A Reader Dear Reader, This is a great question and I’m so glad to be able to respond. Recently I’ve been hearing from many investors like yourself who are caught off base and not sure how to react. And given the extraordinary volatility of the markets (in fact, March 2020 was the most volatile month in the stock market's history), this hesitancy is completely understandable. But as someone who has lived through other crises, from the technology blow-up in 2000 to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the Great Recession in 2008, I’d like to offer some perspective, a tactic, and hopefully some reassurance along the way. A look back in time First, some historical perspective about the stock market. A dollar invested in Treasury Bills in 1926 would be worth about $22 through the end of April, 2020. In contrast, a dollar invested in the large U.S. company stocks in 1926 would be worth about $8,368. Yes, the road to more riches in the stock market was much, much rockier, with lots of sometimes dramatic ups and downs, but the outcome was overwhelmingly positive long-term. Dollar-cost averaging to the rescue Which brings me to an approach I believe will help. I briefly mentioned this tactic, called ‘dollar-cost averaging,’ in last week’s column, but I’d like to go into more detail here. Here’s how it works: Every month (or at any regular interval; for example, every two weeks if you're automatically adding money to your 401(k) from your paycheck), you invest a set amount of money, regardless of how the stock market is performing. The beauty of this approach is that when the markets are down and prices low, you're able to purchase more shares for your money. Conversely, when markets are up and prices high, you purchase fewer shares. Here’s a hypothetical example. Let's say you invest $100 the first day of every month for six months in a fund whose value fluctuates wildly month to month: from $10 per share to $5, to $6, back to $5, to $8, and then back to $10. With dollar-cost averaging over this six-month period, you invest a total of $600 dollars and purchase just a tad over 89 shares, for an average cost of $6.73/share and an ending value of about $892. If instead you'd invested the entire $600 at the beginning of the six months, you'd have only purchased 60 shares, with a much higher average cost of $10/share that would be worth $600 at the end of the six months. Of course, the results will vary depending on the real numbers. If the fund had continued to decline, which you state is your biggest fear, with dollar-cost averaging you'd have purchased even more shares over the six months. On the other hand, if the fund had continued to go up every month, you'd have been better off investing all of your money at once instead of spreading it out. As I pointed out earlier, while the road can be rocky (particularly over the short term), over longer periods of time the stock market tends to rise. In this way, dollar-cost averaging isn’t a guarantee of the biggest profit, or an absolute protection against a loss, but it is a great way to stay the course during a volatile market. An antidote to market timing A built-in benefit of dollar-cost averaging is that it is an antidote to market timing. We all hear about people who want to find that perfect moment to invest and make a killing. And I hear you when you say that you don’t want to invest just to see your values go down. But at Schwab we have a saying that it’s time in the market, not timing the market, that matters. In fact, the length of time you invest matters much more than entering the market at the best time. Let me share some more statistics that illustrate this point. Investments in stocks have outperformed cash over every 20-year period from 1926 to 2019, by a large margin. During these 90-plus years, the average ending wealth for an investor who put $2,000 a year in cash investments for 20 years is approximately $64,500. The average ending wealth for an investor who put their $2,000 a year in the stock market with perfect timing (always investing at the low) is approximately $175,000. And the most interesting data point of all is that the investor who put their $2,000 in the market on the first day of the year, without any thought for timing, would end up with approximately $162,000.1 In other words, they made almost as much as the perfect timer, and outperformed the procrastinator by a three-fold margin. Let me repeat: perfect market timing (which in reality, even the experts can’t implement) doesn’t make nearly as much difference as consistency, year over year. And one of the easiest ways to do that? Dollar-cost averaging. Invest for the long term The biggest message I’d like to share is that investing in the stock market is a long-term endeavor. Although the volatility we've experienced lately has been extreme, dealing with volatility is part of investing. Because the stock market is very reactive to all sorts of external events, most of which we can’t predict, money you'll need within four to five years typically should not be in stocks. (Historically, the average time from the peak in an up market to the trough in a down market and back up again has been about three and a half years. The current COVID-19 downturn could be longer or shorter.) To illustrate, let’s go back to our dollar-cost averaging example. It's possible the fund you purchased would continue to decline for many months. If you then needed the money and were forced to sell, you'd have to accept that loss and that could affect your ability to meet your financial goals. But if you're investing for a long-term goal, the temporary decline doesn’t matter as much. In fact, that temporary decline may give you the opportunity to purchase more shares, potentially setting you up for a bigger profit if the fund goes up. Despite the wild gyrations of the last several months, the stock market remains the best place I know to build long-term wealth. Again, it's not a way for the average investor to make a quick profit. But for investors who have a long timeframe, the stock market is likely exactly where you want to be. Start slowly, but start now and continue to invest regardless of market conditions.

This is part of what makes investing so hard. It can take a long time for investing to pay off and along the way there will most certainly be challenges. Historically, though, every market downturn has been followed by new highs. It may take months, or even years, but if we look at history, eventually the markets recover.

Let’s take a look at a few strategies that many investors overlook. Buying on sale Hearing that you’re still adding money to your investments is music to my ears. It’s not easy to buy when markets have dropped, but this may actually be the best time. Why? When markets are down and you invest new money, you're buying at lower prices. While there’s no guarantee if or how long it may take your investments to rise, it’s still a good bet based on market history. Despite all the volatility over the short term, over the long term, it pays to be an investor. Dollar-cost averaging When market volatility is so high, it’s easy for your emotions (mostly fear) to get the best of you. I worry that new investors will stay on the sidelines, thereby missing out on future market gains. And even seasoned investors can panic, wreaking havoc on their investment plan. That’s where the value of dollar-cost averaging comes in. Dollar-cost averaging is just financial-speak for investing the same amount of money regularly (say, every month), regardless of what the markets are doing. When prices are high, you buy fewer shares. And when prices are depressed, as many are today, you buy more shares with the same amount of money. By investing regular amounts, like you're doing in your 401(k), as prices go up and down, you buy more shares when things are cheaper and fewer shares when things are more expensive. By wading in gradually, as opposed to investing all your money all at once, dollar-cost averaging can help you limit your losses in the event the market declines. Roth conversions When you convert money from a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a Roth, you're subject to paying income taxes on all of the untaxed contributions and earnings. That can add up to a pretty big tax bill depending on the amount you're converting. Higher reported income as a result of a Roth conversion can result in higher Medicare premiums and how much you pay in taxes on Social Security. That can be an unwelcome surprise. But by doing a Roth conversion when your portfolio is down, you can potentially save some cash in taxes. For example, if you were converting 100 shares of stock now worth $50/share as opposed to $100/share, your Roth conversion is now 50 percent cheaper. In other words, you're converting the same number of shares, but at lower prices, which can lower your tax bill. A bear market can be a great time to consider a Roth conversion. But before you convert, consider several factors including: Is your tax rate this year likely to be lower than when you will need the converted assets? Do you need the money within five years? Can you pay the taxes with other taxable account assets? Make sure you understand how a Roth conversion will impact your overall financial plan and consult with your tax or financial advisor. Tax-loss harvesting If you have losses in taxable accounts like a brokerage account, you can take advantage of a technique called tax-loss harvesting. (It won’t work in retirement accounts like an IRA or 401(k) because losses in a tax-deferred account can’t be deducted.) By selling assets—like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs—at a loss, you can offset the taxable liability from selling an investment that has a capital gain. You can deduct up to $3,000 in ordinary income taxes each year above this amount and carry over any remainder into future years. Look at a market decline as an opportunity As improbable as it may seem, there can be a bright side to a down market for disciplined investors. The biggest risk of a steep market decline and volatility is that you'll panic and abandon your plan. Instead, consider taking advantage of the opportunities and strategies above. If you have questions about your long-term plan, talk with a trusted tax or investment advisor for help. They can help you see the big picture, focusing on your long-term objectives, and perhaps capitalizing on market dips along the way. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I find myself in the unfortunate position of needing some cash in the midst of this uncertain market. I have a small emergency fund but that’s not enough. What’s the best way to generate additional cash? —A Reader Dear Reader, First, congratulations on having a rainy day fund. Even if it’s not enough, simply having a savings account shows you’re planning ahead. Emergency savings are your first and best line of defense. But sometimes when it rains, it pours, and in really tough times, you can be left short of what you need. Let’s talk about some options. Take stock of what you’ve got Before you start pulling funds from any account, take a moment or two to look at all of your accounts. Are you forgetting anything? You might be surprised at what you find. This is a little like checking under the cushions for loose change. Having a complete net worth statement and consolidating accounts can make this easier. Then take a look at the various accounts you have set up for specific goals. Different accounts will have varying rules for withdrawals as well as different tax implications. With this big picture in mind, you’ll be better able to make the best decisions. Start here Checking, savings, and money market accounts are the best place to start for several reasons. First, you can withdraw money from checking accounts at any time, although money market and savings accounts may have a few more restrictions. (Typically you’re allowed six “convenience” or electronic/online transfers or debit card withdrawals per month.) Second, since your money is in cash, you generally don’t have to worry about timing (although cashing in certain accounts like CDs before they mature could cause you to forfeit interest as a penalty). And finally, tax implications for these taxable accounts are very low. Next consider brokerage accounts Your next option might be other taxable accounts like a brokerage account. The big gotcha is that because your money is likely invested in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange traded funds, you may give up future gains or lock in losses by selling sooner than you had planned. When you withdraw money from a brokerage account, you may need to pay tax on your gains. On the plus side, capital gains rates can be lower than the ordinary income tax rates you'll pay on withdrawals from retirement accounts like a traditional IRA or 401(k). You may also be able to harvest losses to offset gains when selling, and deduct up to $3,000 against your income. Last on the list for withdrawals are retirement accounts Retirement accounts are usually the last place you want to pull money from for two reasons: 1) once you withdraw funds, it may be very challenging to make up lost retirement savings, and 2) the tax consequences are typically the highest because withdrawals, or ‘distributions,’ from either a traditional 401(k) or a traditional IRA are normally subject to ordinary income taxes plus a 10 percent penalty for those under age 59½. Additionally, if your money is invested, you may be looking at selling at a loss. (But unlike a brokerage account, you can’t use losses to offset gains.) However, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, Congress waived the penalty for 2020 on withdrawals up to $100,000 for those individuals who are directly impacted. Those individuals will also be able to stretch the income tax bill over three years. Alternatively, they can roll the money back into a 401(k)-type plan or an IRA within three years, and skip the tax payments. Roth IRAs are different. First, you can withdraw your contributions without any tax consequence at any time. Second, provided you're over age 59½ and the Roth has been established for at least 5 years, you can withdraw all earnings income tax free. Roth accounts can be a great place to withdraw a large lump sum. For more help on taxes and penalties when making a withdrawal from a retirement account, be sure to talk to your financial advisor and tax professional. Borrowing may be an option Another approach would be to borrow money to meet your short-term needs. This only makes sense if you're confident that you'll be able to handle the payments; missing payments can damage your credit score, cost you more money, and spiral down from there. Let’s review your options. Borrowing against your home: Home Equity Line of Credit and Home Installment Loans—A home equity line of credit (HELOC) or home equity installment loan is basically taking a second mortgage on your home. Interest rates on these types of loans are generally low, but that’s because you're borrowing against your home. Missing a payment could lead to foreclosure. Borrowing against yourself: Credit cards and personal loans—Charging your expenses on a credit card can be convenient in the moment, but the high interest rates are potentially lethal if you need to carry a balance month to month. Personal loans can also have very high interest rates, especially if you have a low credit score. Borrowing from your retirement: 401(k) Loans—As I mentioned above, I generally think of all retirement funds as sacred. That said, taking a short-term loan from your 401(k) may be a viable option, provided you're convinced you'll be able to pay the loan back in the near future. Just be certain to understand all the rules, how the payments affect your paycheck and the tax consequences if you lose your job or miss a payment. Defaulting on 401(k) loan payments can lead to taxes and penalties. Borrowing from nontraditional lenders: Pay day loans and pawnshops—Finally, using nontraditional lenders like payday or vehicle title loans or a pawnshop may be quick and easy but dangerous and costly. Avoid these borrowing options at all costs. To have to come up with money quickly that you hadn’t planned for can be unsettling. But you may have more options than you think. Make sure to look at all of them and consider how your choice could affect other areas of your financial plan. If you’re strategic and careful, you’ll have the best chance to get through your crunch unharmed. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I'm 56 and have both a traditional and a Roth 401(k). Right now I contribute the maximum to my Roth each year. I plan to roll the Roth 401(k) into a Roth IRA before 72 to avoid having to take an RMD. Two questions: Do I need to open a Roth IRA five years prior to the rollover to meet the 5-year rule? And can I contribute to a Roth IRA even though I max out my Roth 401(k)? —A Reader Dear Reader, I rarely get questions regarding a Roth 401(k) rollover, but as this type of retirement plan becomes more widely available, I'm sure more and more people will be looking for similar answers. So thanks for asking. I think you're right on target with your basic idea. With a Roth 401(k)—unlike a Roth IRA—you must take a required minimum distribution (RMD) beginning at age 72 (for those born on or after July 1, 1949) if you’re retired. So the idea of rolling your Roth 401(k) money into a Roth IRA before that magic age makes a lot of sense. With your money in a Roth IRA, rather than being required to take a certain amount out of your retirement savings each year, you can choose how much, when—or if ever—you want to make withdrawals. But as you suggest, there are certain things you need to be aware of to make sure you can take full advantage of all the Roth IRA benefits. Digging into the 5-year rule One of the key benefits of a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) is that, while contributions aren't tax-deductible, both contributions and earnings can be withdrawn tax and penalty free once you reach age 59½. (Note that 401(k)s may have additional rules around withdrawals.) That can make a huge difference in your tax liability during retirement. There's only one catch: To get this total tax-free benefit, either type of Roth account has to be open for five years. The clock starts ticking January 1st of the year you make your first contribution. That seems fairly straightforward. However, what most people might not realize is that when you rollover a Roth 401(k) to a Roth IRA, the clock is reset. And in this case, it's the timing of the Roth IRA that counts. For example, let's say you've had a Roth 401(k) for 10 years and you've also had a Roth IRA for five years. If you roll your Roth 401(k) into your Roth IRA, there's no problem. You've met the 5-year rule. But now let's say you've only had your Roth IRA for three years. Even though your Roth 401(k) meets the 5-year rule and then some, if you roll it into your three-year-old Roth IRA, you'd have to wait another two years before you could withdraw earnings tax-free (although, as with any Roth account, you could withdraw your contributions tax-free at any time). So to answer your first question, yes, it could make sense to open a Roth IRA at least five years before you plan to rollover your Roth 401(k). However, it's not enough to open it. You have to make a contribution for the five-year time period to start. The problem is that not everyone is eligible to do so. The ins and outs of opening and contributing to a Roth IRA The easy answer to your second question is again, yes, you can potentially contribute to a Roth IRA even if you contribute the yearly maximum to a 401(k). In fact, it's an ideal retirement savings scenario to contribute the maximum to both. And it's something I highly recommend if you can afford it. For 2022, you can contribute up to $20,500 to a 401(k) with a $6,500 catch up if you're 50 or over. You can contribute up to $6,000 to a Roth IRA with a $1,000 catch up (if you're 50 or over). Together, that's a sizeable savings. So on the surface, it would appear you're good to go. However, although there are no income limits for contributing to a Roth 401(k), there are yearly income limits for contributing to a Roth IRA, and that could throw a wrench in your plan. For 2022, if your adjusted gross income (AGI) is $144,000 or over for single filers ($214,000 or over for married filing joint) you won’t be eligible to make a Roth IRA contribution. Some additional considerations You say you're contributing the maximum to your Roth 401(k), but you may want to consider splitting your contribution between your traditional 401(k) and your Roth 401(k). This provides a bit of tax diversification, giving you a tax deduction now as well as tax-free withdrawals later. And the tax deduction might also have a side benefit of lowering your AGI, possibly making you eligible for a Roth IRA. It's all worth some consideration.

       "   'abstract': \"Ready to panic? Don't. In times of turmoil, sticking with your plan and staying invested is the best strategy.\",\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, The widespread impact of coronavirus has had everyone on edge. And while some parts of the economy are opening up, I’ve been hearing from many of you who are rightfully concerned about ongoing market uncertainty. Seeing your portfolio balance fluctuate dramatically is worrisome for any investor, especially newer investors who have only seen the market rise, and older investors who are near or in retirement. But before you panic, remind yourself that shock and surprise are hallmarks of the stock market. How long will this last? What’s next? No one knows for sure, but there are positive things you can do to keep your investments on track and help you stay cool, calm and collected. 1. Stick to your plan The urge to do something—anything—can be overwhelming. The problem is you often wind up making things worse, either by selling too low immediately after a market downturn and missing out on future gains, or by chasing performance after markets take off. Often, the best strategy is to do nothing. This is where having a plan really pays off. A plan reminds you of why you’re investing and goals that are important to you. A good financial plan is also strategic, but not written in stone. As your goals change, it evolves along with your situation. Modern financial plans often use advanced computer simulations to allow you to evaluate probabilities of different “what if” scenarios, including the impact of stock market corrections and other life changes on your goals. Don’t have a plan? It’s not too late. You can create one on your own, or better yet contact an advisor to review your situation. 2. Keep things in perspective Even during recent market declines, investors were still up from the bottom of the great financial crisis in March of 2009. Keep in mind that the higher the market, the smaller percentage a large point drop represents. How much a drop in the market will impact you depends on your overall investment allocation and where you are in relation to your financial goals. Remind yourself of your long-term goals. Not looking at your portfolio too frequently can actually help. While you may be able to look at your investments at any time, it’s often a good idea to match your “look interval” with your investment time horizon. To put this another way, if you’re trying to lose 20 pounds in a year, weighing yourself every hour—in grams—is counterproductive and frustrating. If you have a balanced portfolio that is lined up with your risk tolerance and time horizon, looking at your retirement account daily isn’t necessary and can cause unneeded stress. For most people, quarterly or annual reviews should be sufficient. 3. Don’t time the market People instinctively want big gains without having to bear losses. However, trying to avoid the pain of losses can lead people to not taking enough risk, indiscriminate selling or holding on to a risky or losing investment for too long. These types of behaviors can have all sorts of negative consequences, from not being able to reach your financial goals to a large tax bill. Attempts at “getting out” or “getting in” at the right time—known as market timing—can easily backfire. As we’ve seen, markets can march along steadily for long periods of time and shift—up or down—with blinding speed. Rather than trying to time the market, base your investment strategy on the twin pillars of asset allocation and diversification. Your asset allocation (the way you divide your investments between different asset classes such as stock, bonds, and cash) should reflect your willingness and need to take on risk. Diversification adds another level of control because all of your holdings will likely not go up and down at the same time, or at the same level. This means that at all times, some parts of your portfolio will likely be doing better than others. 4. Ignore (or at least filter) the noise There is a tendency to be easily influenced by recent news, events, or experiences. Admittedly, it’s hard to tune out the racket of 24/7 market news. But this can lead to unnecessary or erratic trading and cause you to stray from your plan. Take time to ask questions and fact-check sources. Adopt a broad view of your situation. Working with an advisor can often help you discover another point of view and point to strategies and options you may not have considered. 5. Focus on what you can control The reality is that markets are constantly changing. And while the stock market has gone up over the long term, it’s anybody’s guess what it will do in the short term. You can’t predict or control the market. But you can control how you manage your investments, your savings rate, having a financial plan and how you react to events. I can’t tell you how long an up or down market will last. No one can. What I can tell you for certain is that following these five steps will increase the odds of reaching your long-term financial goals—and getting a better night’s sleep.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I'm a single parent with two middle-school age kids and was just laid off because COVID-19 regulations forced my employer to shut down. I'm worried I may be out of work for a while. I received a small severance and have a 401(k), but that’s about it. What’s the best way to get through the next few months? Can I draw money from my 401(k)? What about health insurance? –A Reader Dear Reader, As I said in a recent column about getting through tough financial times, the current crisis is impacting millions of hard-working and responsible Americans who suddenly find themselves in a financial crunch they could never have imagined only a few months ago. My heart goes out to every one of you, especially those of you who are single parents. But although things can feel like they're spinning out of control now, the key is to stay positive and take action. Here are some concrete steps you can take right away to help you both financially and emotionally. File for unemployment If you haven’t already, do it now. The state you live in and the amount you made over the past year will determine how much you get. It won't replace your entire paycheck, but can certainly help. Also, the federal government has increased benefits due to COVID-19, by adding an extra $600/week for up to four months. Check with your state for details. Careeronestop.org is a good resource for unemployment updates and linking to your state's unemployment insurance website. Look into COBRA If you work for a company with at least 20 employees, you may be able to continue your group health insurance through COBRA for up to 18 months. The catch is that premiums can be a lot higher than you paid as an employee. Contact the benefits department at your previous employer and get the facts including the cost and the process for making the switch. Then do some comparison-shopping before you elect COBRA. You may be able to find a lower-cost policy through your state's or the federal ACA exchange at healthcare.gov. You may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period if you lose health coverage through your employer or the employer of a family member. Whatever you do, health insurance is a must for you and your children. You don't want an illness or injury to jeopardize you or your family—especially now. Do some careful personal accounting With a reduction in income, it's more important than ever to get a handle on your expenses. Here's what I suggest you do first: Focus on essentials—List what you spend on your mortgage or rent, utilities, phone/internet, groceries, insurance premiums, debt payments—anything you have to pay each month. This will help you decide where you can most easily cut back for a while. Prioritize your debts—Debts can't be ignored, but they can be prioritized. Once you have your essentials covered, consider temporarily paying only the minimum on mortgage/rent, car loans, student loans and credit cards. Be proactive and contact creditors if you’re struggling before they reach out to you. Look at your budget in light of your resources. With this information in front of you, calculate how much money you have on hand and how long you can get by. Include your severance, unemployment benefits, child-support if you get it, and any emergency savings. Don't forget to include the stimulus payment you may qualify for under the recently passed economic relief plan. Review your 401(k) options I’m glad you mentioned having 401(k) savings, because that will be a very valuable resource down the road. You basically have four options: Leave the 401(k) with your employer plan. Roll over to a new employer. Roll over to an IRA. Withdraw or cash out the 401(k). It’s important to understand differences in fees, taxes and risks with all options. Discuss your situation with a tax and financial advisor if you need more help. Be careful about taking a 401(k) withdrawal Your present situation may be difficult, but you still have to protect your future. While your 401(k) could be a resource if you remain unemployed for a long time, I suggest using it only when absolutely necessary. On the positive side, new rules under the CARES Act allow you to take an early distribution of up to $100,000 from a retirement account in 2020 penalty-free, as long as it's related to the coronavirus. Taxes on withdrawals can also be spread out over three years. Plus, you can avoid the taxes entirely if you pay back the distribution within three years. Discuss this option with a tax advisor before you make a decision. Even so, if you have any other sources of cash, for instance a HELOC if you own your home, you may want to explore those options first. Check into other forms of assistance From mortgage forbearance to eviction protection to utilities not cutting off services for nonpayment, there are a number of ways to get some economic relief during these difficult times. Don't hesitate to check into—and take advantage—of them. Talk to your mortgage lender or landlord, contact your phone, internet and utilities service providers. Now, more than ever, people are willing to help. Include your kids as you look to the future If you haven't talked openly to your kids about your new economic reality, now's the time. In fact, at their ages, they can be part of the solution. Get their ideas on how you could all cut back. What are some things they're willing to postpone until you're working again? If you include them in the process, they'll be less resistant—and perhaps you'll all be less anxious as you get through these next few months together. And then, once you’re back on an even keel, it will be time to revisit your long-term planning and saving, including building a several month cash reserve for the next emergency. In the meantime, take advantage of all the resources available to you, and prioritize all of your spending. Focus on what you can control as you care for yourself and your children. Together, you'll find your way to a brighter future. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': \"Here's what to do—and not do—to help minimize taxes in retirement.\",\n",
       "   'content': 'Most retirees don\\'t have enough invested to live off the interest alone—even when combined with Social Security, pensions, and other nonportfolio income—so at some point they\\'ll need to start liquidating their investment assets. The challenge is doing so in a way that minimizes the drag from taxes. After all, every dollar lost to taxes is one you can’t spend. \"Fortunately, not all investments are subject to the same tax treatment,\" says Hayden Adams, CPA, CFP®, and director of tax planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, \"and if you liquidate them in a tax-efficient way, you could help your savings last longer.\" With that in mind, here\\'s a step-by-step approach to making tax-smart withdrawals in retirement. Step 1: Take your RMDs If you\\'re 72 or older, start by taking the required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your tax-deferred retirement accounts. Failure to do so means getting hit with a 50% penalty on the difference between what you withdrew and what was required. \"Because of the penalty, RMDs should be your first stop when tapping your retirement portfolio,\" Hayden says. (Most financial institutions—including Schwab—can help calculate your RMDs when the time comes, or you can estimate them ahead of time using an online calculator.) Whatever you withdraw will be taxed as ordinary income, so if you don\\'t need this money to cover your living expenses, consider depositing it into a taxable brokerage account, where you could potentially put it back to work in the market. Step 2: Tap interest and dividends Next, withdraw the interest and dividends—but not the original investment—from your taxable accounts. \"Leaving the original investment untouched means it can continue to grow and potentially yield more dividends and/or interest in the future,\" Hayden says. Interest is taxed as ordinary income—unless it\\'s from a tax-free municipal bond or municipal bond fund. Dividends, on the other hand, are often taxed at the lower capital gains rate of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on income level—provided certain requirements, such as minimum holding periods, are met. Step 3: Collect principal from maturing bonds and CDs Many retirees rely on bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs) to generate regular income. Laddering such investments—that is, buying bonds and/or CDs with staggered maturity dates and reinvesting the principal as each comes due—can help provide a steady stream of income from interest payments while evening out your portfolio’s yields over time. However, should you still need cash after exhausting RMDs (if you\\'re of age) and your interest and dividends, the principal from a maturing bond or CD is often the next place to turn. Generally speaking, you won\\'t owe any taxes on your original principal, so long as you hold on to a bond or CD until its maturity date; an early sale will trigger capital gains taxes if you earn a profit on the sale. Step 4: Sell additional assets as needed If the income generated from Steps 1 through 3 isn\\'t enough to cover your expenses, you\\'ll need to sell additional assets to close the gap. But which accounts should you tap first—and in what proportion? If you have modest tax-deferred savings or your RMDs aren\\'t likely to push you into a higher tax bracket, depleting your taxable brokerage accounts first leaves your tax-deferred assets to potentially grow until RMDs kick in. To tap your taxable accounts most efficiently: First, part with investments that have lost value. Your losses can be used to offset any gains you may realize—a strategy known as tax-loss harvesting (see \"Using a tax loss to get a tax break,\" below). \"And if you don\\'t realize any capital gains, you can use those losses to offset up to $3,000 of your ordinary income per year until all your losses have been used up,\" Hayden says. Just be sure you don’t violate the wash-sale rule by repurchasing the same or \"substantially identical\" securities within 30 days before or after the sale, lest your losses be disallowed. Next, focus on selling investments you\\'ve held for more than a year to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates. You can sell these appreciated investments as part of your regular portfolio rebalancing, using whatever\\'s necessary to meet your spending needs and reinvesting the remainder in underweight areas of your portfolio. If you have significant tax-deferred savings, it\\'s possible that your RMDs could push you into a higher tax bracket once they kick in, especially after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. If you suspect this could be the case, you may want to consider drawing down your tax-deferred accounts and your taxable savings at the same time. With this approach, you take withdrawals from both your tax-deferred and taxable accounts in amounts proportionate to their balances. For example, say you have $800,000 in a traditional IRA and $200,000 in a brokerage account for a total of $1 million in savings. If you require $50,000 from your portfolio to fund your spending, you’d take $40,000 (80%) from your tax-deferred IRA and $10,000 (20%) from your taxable brokerage account using the tax-efficient withdrawal strategy mentioned above. \"This strategy can help smooth out the potential spike in income caused by RMDs, which may reduce your total taxes paid in retirement,\" Hayden says. Distributions from your tax-deferred accounts will be taxed as ordinary income, so the order in which you sell them doesn\\'t matter from a tax perspective; however, you should still draw them down in a way that maintains your target asset allocation. Using a tax loss to get a tax break A hypothetical investor who realized $20,000 in short-term capital gains and has $25,000 in unrealized capital losses, could use tax-loss harvesting to cut down her tax bill. Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Assumes a 32% combined federal/state marginal income tax bracket, with short-term capital gains taxed at the ordinary income tax rates. The example is hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to represent a specific investment product and the example does not reflect the effects of fees. Step 5: Save Roth accounts for last \"Generally, it\\'s in your interest to hold off on tapping Roth assets for as long as possible,\" Hayden says. That\\'s because: Withdrawals are entirely tax-free starting at age 59½, provided you\\'ve held the account for at least five years. Roth IRAs aren\\'t subject to RMDs—you can leave these assets to grow indefinitely during your lifetime. Withdrawals are also tax-free for your heirs. \"The laws could always change, but at least for now it’s one of the best assets you can pass on to the next generation,\" Hayden says. Unlike Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s are subject to RMDs—which is why it might make sense for some people to roll over any existing Roth 401(k) accounts into a Roth IRA. Be aware, however, that converting a Roth 401(k) to a Roth IRA could reset the five-year holding requirement—unless funds are rolled into an existing Roth IRA, in which case they benefit from the holding period on that account. If you\\'re considering a rollover, it’s best to check with a financial advisor before you decide. Get help if you need it While some retirees enjoy actively managing their investments, others might not want to get bogged down in the intricacies of handling their withdrawals and taxes. \"Determining which assets to sell can be complex, and some savers would really benefit from working with a financial advisor, a tax professional, or an automated robo-advisor,\" Hayden says (see \"Creating tax-smart withdrawals during retirement,\" below). \"Either way, managing your tax liability can be an effective way to help keep more money in your pocket and potentially extend the life of your savings.\" Creating tax-smart withdrawals during retirement Schwab Intelligent Income™—a feature of Schwab Intelligent Portfolios®—is an automated investing solution that generates a predictable, tax-smart, monthly paycheck from your investments.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My partner and I recently had our first child and are trying to get our finances in order. We met with an attorney to put together a will, and she mentioned that we might need life insurance. I do have a policy through work, but now that I'm a new dad, I don’t know if it’s enough. Can you advise me on how much I need and the best type? —A Reader Dear Reader, Congratulations on being a new father! I’m sure you have a lot on your mind, so I’m gratified to hear that you’re thinking about your finances at this important time in your life. And I’m especially glad to hear that your attorney brought up life insurance. Insurance is designed to help you cover an unlikely event that could be financially catastrophic. In the case of life insurance, you’re protecting your dependents from the loss of your future earnings. For example, a life insurance policy can pay your mortgage, college tuition, or even funeral costs so that your surviving dependents will be able to continue on with their goals and maintain their lifestyle. Anyone like yourself who has someone counting on them for their financial welfare will likely need life insurance. Young families in particular have more debts and fewer financial assets, so life insurance is often critically important. Retirees with no debts and enough savings, on the other hand, may not need life insurance at all. And it’s not just the breadwinner that may need life insurance. While a stay-at-home parent or full-time homemaker may not bring in a paycheck, they provide innumerable services (for free!) that would cost thousands of dollars to replace. Life insurance needs evolve with time Some families only need life insurance until the kids finish college and the mortgage is paid. Other families, though, for example those with a special-needs child, may need insurance for a lifetime. It’s important to understand that your life insurance needs will change over time. Make sure to review your coverage with any major life event like moving, the addition of a new family member, changing jobs, or buying a new home. Zeroing in on the amount of insurance you need One of your first decisions is how much life insurance you need. An aggressive sales person might try to sell you more than you need, so it’s smart to begin your process with what is generally referred to as a “needs-based” analysis. Start with a net worth statement, which is simply a list of all your assets and liabilities. Next you’ll want to review your income and expenses, and include any future liabilities (e.g., additional debts, college costs) and future financial resources (e.g., Social Security survivor benefits) that might come along. The amount of insurance you need will be the difference between the two. Some individuals might also want to incorporate charitable, business, and other legacy goals. The more complicated your situation, the more it makes sense to meet with a trusted financial advisor, insurance professional, and possibly an estate planning attorney. And in the final analysis, make sure the insurance fits within your budget. It doesn’t make sense to purchase a policy that you can’t afford. Timing matters It’s often better to buy life insurance sooner rather than later. Life insurance is cheaper the younger and healthier you are; a big health change can even make you uninsurable. It’s like that old expression, the best time to buy flood insurance is before the flood. Don’t delay. Understand the two main types of life insurance The two main types of life insurance are term and permanent. Term insurance is sometimes called “if I die” coverage. It covers you for a fixed period of time like 1, 10, 20 or 30 years. At the end of term, most policies lapse. Because most life insurance needs are finite (at some point most kids will be on their own and the mortgage paid off), term insurance is very cost-effective. Permanent life insurance (whole life, variable life, universal life, among other types), on the other hand, is described as “when I die” coverage. As long as you pay enough in premiums to keep the policy in force, a death benefit will pay out. Coverage is designed to last a lifetime. These policies will have additional features, including the ability to build savings or “cash value” that some individuals find attractive. In a way, the difference between term and permanent life insurance is like the difference between renting versus buying a home. Term insurance (like renting) is the most cost-effective solution over shorter periods of time and makes the most sense for most families. Permanent insurance (like owning) is more expensive up front, but allows the policy owner to build equity over time, and can be the best choice for families who know that they will continue to need insurance far into the future. Also, you don’t have to choose one type of policy over the other. You can mix and match to get the right coverage. Group vs individual policies You mention that you have group life insurance through work, but that may not be enough. Group policies have limited underwriting, so if you're in worse than average health it could be a great solution. If you're in better than average health it might be cheaper to purchase individual coverage that's customized to your needs. Also, if you opt for group insurance, you should check to see what happens when you leave the company. You can buy individual insurance on your own or working with an agent. Take your time to understand what you're buying, why an agent might be recommending it, and the financial strength of the insurance company that's backing it. Shop around and do your homework. Insurance isn’t the most exciting thing to think about, so it can easily fall to the bottom of our to-do lists. That said, I view it as important to almost every financial plan—for dads and moms. And life insurance, in particular, can be one of the biggest gifts that you ever give to protect your growing family. Congratulations again! Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'For new graduates looking for a job in this difficult market, smart money management is crucial.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, I’m hearing from lots of students and recent grads about how uneasy they are about entering the labor force in this difficult economic climate. With unemployment numbers at a record high, it’s no surprise that the estimated 4 million new college graduates will have a particularly challenging time this year. But all is not lost, especially for those of you who are determined and smart about your search. Here are a few tips. Be aggressive in your job search I’m not going to sugarcoat it. Looking for a new job is hard, even under the best of circumstances. And it’s really hard right now. While you may have a lot of talent to offer, the competition will be extra fierce. Understand that your most valuable asset is what economists call your “human capital.” That is the ability over time to convert all of your skills, energy and talents into work that will generate income and can build financial wealth. In other words, don’t just think about your major when considering who might hire you. Think of all the skills and experiences you have to offer an employer. But realize that no matter how qualified you are, your job search could take weeks or months longer than usual in this environment. Don’t have an updated resume? Get busy. Not sure who’s hiring? Aggressively follow every lead. If you think commuting or relocating is for someone else, you might want to reconsider. And if you’re short on experience, look for internships, unpaid opportunities, or part-time jobs. Some of these positions may be temporary but others may evolve and wind up permanent. Be conservative with your spending and liberal with your savings Now isn’t the time to adopt a “YOLO” attitude about your finances. Don’t have a budget? Start putting one together. Prioritize and decide where you can cut expenses. Cheaper phone plan? Unneeded subscriptions? Put it all on the table. Make savings a big part of your budget, starting with an emergency fund. Your goal is to eventually build this fund to cover three to six months of essential expenses, but any amount you’re able to set aside is a plus. If you find an employer who offers a 401(k) match, take full advantage of it. But make the match the minimum. Save more when and if you can. Be sure to have health insurance Don’t try to get away without health insurance. You can stay under a parent’s plan until age 26, even if you live in a different location. You can also shop for plan coverage through healthcare.gov if you don’t have coverage through a job or a parent. Use caution with individual or short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans. These plans could be cheaper in the short run but extremely costly over the long run with pre-existing exclusions, limited benefits and large out-of-pocket expenses if you get sick. Don’t take any unnecessary chances with your health. Be aware of rules for student loans For most federal student loan types, after you graduate or leave school you have a six-month grace period (sometimes nine months for Perkins Loans) before payments are due. And now, to address financial hardships caused by COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Education will automatically suspend payments on most federal student loans from March 13, 2020 through January 31, 2022. No interest or penalties will accrue on loans during this time. (Normally, for most loans, interest still accrues during any grace period.) After January 31 2022, this payment suspension and interest waiver will end. Taking advantage of this program won’t affect your credit and the loans won’t go into delinquency or default. It also means collection agencies shouldn’t call or write you during this period. However, if you'd still like to make payments during this period, you can. This could be a good option if you can afford it because the entire payment will go towards principal, reducing the total amount you pay and helping you pay off the loan faster. (Borrowers who already have an income-driven repayment plan can ask to have their monthly payment recalculated at any time to allow them to make payments and still cover essentials as their income changes.) Private student loan options vary by lender, so check with your lender. Some additional good news is that with interest rates dropping, refinancing may make sense. You could save a bundle in interest, but take care to understand what existing benefits and protections you might be trading off. Whether your loans are federal or private, contact your lender or loan servicer for more eligibility requirements. If you don’t know who your loan servicer is for a federal loan, visit studentaid.gov/login or call 1-800-4-FED-AID for assistance. Be proactive in reaching out to other creditors Federal regulators are encouraging banks and businesses to work with their customers to help them through temporary financial hardships due to COVID-19. Therefore, if you're having difficulty making any type of payments, contact the lender and ask for help. This includes contacting your bank or landlord regarding your mortgage or rent as well as credit card or auto finance companies. If they don’t know you’re struggling, they can’t help you, so don’t hide. Be connected and optimistic While you are actively seeking a job, your friends and family can be your most important anchors. Reach out to them on a regular basis, and don’t hesitate to share your fears or your successes. Sites like LinkedIn can be a great way to expand your professional network. Talking with peers can lead to stronger friendships and camaraderie as well as to new job leads. My heart goes out to young people who are facing such a challenge at this point in their lives. Take care of yourself physically and emotionally so that you're ready to jump on opportunities. We'll get beyond this crisis, and your future will soon come into clear focus.

       "   'abstract': 'Not sure how to choose the best guardian for your kids? Start by asking yourself some important questions.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My husband and I can't come to an agreement on who to appoint as a guardian for our three young children. He says his brother, I say my sister. How can we reach an agreement? —A Reader Dear Reader, Although my kids are now grown up, your question takes me right back to when my husband Gary and I were trying to make this same decision. Like you, we were fortunate enough to have a few choices, but choosing among them seemed impossible. And let's be honest, there are always pros and cons to every possible choice, because no one, no matter how special, can really take your place. Because it's such an emotional decision—and because it's so important (if you don't name a guardian, the state will choose one for you)—I think the best way to go about it is to make a list of all the important considerations. Then you and your husband can examine each one from a practical perspective as well as an emotional one and, hopefully, come to an agreement. That's what our estate planning attorney helped us to do and I'm happy to pass his insights on to you. Ask yourself these questions Answering the following questions will help you zero in on what's most important as you consider the possibility of someone else raising your children. Does the prospective guardian share your values? Whether it's religious, moral, political or personal, ideally you want someone to raise your children with the beliefs and attitudes that you hold dear. Of course, no two people think exactly alike, but if, for instance, you want your kids to grow up in a socially liberal environment, you'd want a guardian to have an open mind on social issues. How intimately does this person know you and your family? How comfortable are your kids with this person? The closer your kids are to a potential guardian, the easier it will be on them during what is a very difficult transition. How many children does the prospective guardian already have? What is their parenting style? If someone already has a full house, there may not be room for your kids. And in terms of parenting, you want someone who could provide a sense of continuity when it comes to things like discipline and personal responsibility. What's the age and health of the individual you're considering? Since you mention your siblings, age may not be a factor, but it's good to think about these things. Depending on the age of your children at the time, this could be a long-term commitment. Where does the guardian live? Do you want your children to be uprooted? It's one thing to move a toddler across country but quite another to tear a teenager away from junior high or high school where friends and social networks have already been established. Focusing on these issues may point more toward one or another potential guardian. But once you've answered these questions to your mutual satisfaction, there's still another important consideration. Think about financial stability Hopefully you and your husband have enough life insurance to provide for your kids financially through college. It's one thing to ask someone to care for your kids and quite another to ask them to support them. But whatever your financial circumstances, whether it's through personal assets or insurance, your children will most likely have some type of inheritance that needs to be managed carefully. Fortunately, you can choose to appoint both a personal guardian and what's called a guardian of the estate. They don't have to be the same individual. So let's say your sister is the most financially savvy and your husband's brother has the best family set up to care for the children. You could involve each according to their circumstances. However, it's very important that the guardian of the person and the guardian of the estate get along and agree on what's best for the kids. Get the guardian's consent Once you and your husband agree, the next step is to talk to the prospective guardian. Make sure he or she understands why you've chosen them and is willing to take on the responsibility. Actually, I think it's a good idea to have a second choice in case the first one is unable at the time to fulfill the role. Realize that you can revisit your choice every few years Nothing is cast in stone, not even your will. If something changes over the years, don't hesitate to change your guardian choice. No one's feelings should be hurt. The deciding factor should always be what's best for your children at the time. Believe me, I know this whole process isn't easy, and hopefully your guardian will never have to step in. But make the choice now, and put it in writing. Then as you and your family go about living a full and happy life, you can rest a bit easier knowing your kids are taken care of—just in case. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'Times of crisis raise a lot of questions about how to manage your money. Here are three that are relevant today.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, Recently I did my first ever Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA). I was really excited about it, and not just because my kids are Redditors who constantly seek and give advice on the channel. I wanted to have a real-time discussion with people about something that\\'s weighing heavily on everyone\\'s minds: How to manage your personal finances during times of crisis. I had a lively two-hour chat with the Redditors and answered about 40 questions on topics ranging from what to do with stimulus money and advice for new investors to suggestions for recent grads entering the job market during turbulent times and whether I prefer burgers or burritos. It was so much fun, and I hope I offered some actionable advice and helped calm a few fears. I want to extend that conversation to my Ask Carrie readers too, so here are some questions I didn\\'t get a chance to answer during the live event. Curious about what else people were asking? You can check out the full Reddit AMA conversation here. Three new questions about managing money today 1) What would be the best place to park my emergency money? I was thinking of splitting it between a money market fund and a high-yield savings account. I need high liquidity, although I won\\'t need the money for 2-3 years when I plan to purchase a second-hand car. What are your thoughts? You actually have two issues here: 1) Where to put your emergency fund, and 2) How to save for a short-term goal. While they may seem similar on the surface, you really should look at each pot of money differently. An emergency fund needs to be safe, immediately available, and only used if you\\'re in a jam—like a job loss or health issue. Ideally, it should be enough to cover 3-6 months essential expenses and kept in a separate account, preferably an interest-bearing checking account, a high-yield savings account or a money market fund. Once it\\'s there, don\\'t touch it until you absolutely need it. When saving for a goal like a car, it depends on your time frame. Any money you\\'ll need in 3-5 years shouldn\\'t be in the stock market, so you\\'ll want to be conservative here, too. But you have a few more options. A high-yield savings or money market account is one choice. You might also consider CDs or a short-term bond fund, which would give you increased liquidity and possibly a bit more of a return—with a little more risk if rates increase, and interest rates are pretty low across the board right now. But no matter where you put this money, the most important thing is to keep the two pots separate. Then you can relax knowing you\\'re likely covered in case of the unexpected—and you can look forward to buying that car when the time is right. 2) Where should a couple in their mid-30s with two young children and a higher than average mortgage put any extra income? We\\'re looking to invest any savings into something more lucrative for our future. Before we get into investing possibilities, let\\'s talk a bit about your mortgage. Since you say it\\'s higher than average, you might consider using some of your extra money to pay it down more quickly. Or you may do well by refinancing since interest rates are at historic lows. That could save you on interest and help free up more money every month, which you could then invest for your future. Consider how long you plan to stay in the house and the refi costs. As to investing opportunities, before you do anything else, both of you should make retirement a top priority by contributing to a 401(k) or IRA. (Be sure to contribute enough to a 401(k) to capture the maximum employer match.) If you have that covered, you might look into your eligibility for a health savings account (HSA), which is a tax-advantaged way to save and invest for healthcare costs today and tomorrow. Then there\\'s the kids\\' educations. You could set up a 529 account for each and make regular contributions to get a jump on college. All of these opportunities combine potential growth with tax advantages—great for the present and the future. 3) My job is considered essential so I\\'m still working and able to pay my bills. Because I have fewer expenses right now, I actually have some money saved for the first time. How should I go about investing it for the future? I\\'ve always been a paycheck-to-paycheck guy and don\\'t have anything saved for retirement (I\\'m 31). Not sure how to go about it after the stock markets have crashed. I\\'m glad you mentioned retirement because that\\'s exactly where you should begin. If your company offers a 401(k), start contributing at least enough to get any company match. A 401(k) is an easy way to start investing and makes saving and investing automatic. At your age, I’d target saving at least 15 percent (including employer match) and avoid being too conservative with your investments. You have time on your side. With the money you\\'ve saved, I\\'d make sure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of necessary expenses (see question 1) before focusing more on retirement saving above any match. If you don\\'t have a 401(k), I\\'d recommend opening an individual retirement account (IRA) and setting up regular monthly payments to it from your paycheck. You can do this through a bank or brokerage company. You\\'ll have to choose your own investments, but fortunately many broad-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds give you a simple, low cost way to begin investing in stocks, bonds, and other asset classes. There are plenty of reliable websites that give details on funds, including performance and fees, and let you comparison shop. And don\\'t be too focused on the current stock market. Successful investing is about staying in it for the long term. At your age, retirement is a long way off, so you likely have plenty of time to ride out market ups and downs. In fact, when you’re trying to \"buy low, sell high,\" it can be better to invest after a market decline. But the most important thing is to get started. I hope to be doing more Q&As in the future.

But according to a recent survey by the National Foundation for Financial Education®, nearly 9 in 10 Americans say that COVID-19 is making money a primary cause of anxiety. Add to that the need to juggle working from home, child care, home schooling and health concerns and people are being stretched to the limit. Understandably, people are worried about their financial future. Equally understandably, they often don't feel like they have the energy to deal with it. But as overwhelming as it can seem, there are strategies to help you cope and stay calm. As I wrote recently, you may have to think differently to get through these times, but there are ways to do it. And it starts with awareness. Be aware of what you can control First realize that no matter how uncertain you may feel, there are some financial things you can still control. That in itself will help ease your stress. For instance, to a certain extent, you can control your spending. That may mean you have to rethink your budget, but it's in your hands. You can also control the way you prioritize your bills. It may require you to do some negotiating, but it's possible. And you can control how much you save, even if you have to redirect some of your savings to more pressing financial needs for a while. If you're an investor, while you can't control the markets, you can control the way you respond to market events. Trying to time the market is rarely a good strategy, and bailing out at the wrong time can be a costly mistake. So don't. Rather than overreacting to current volatility, thoughtfully rebalance based on your own goals and timeline. Smart rebalancing means systematically selling investments that have increased in value and buying those that have decreased in value. In short, rebalancing can help you limit risk by selling high and buying low. In all these areas, you're still in charge. Try to focus on what you can do proactively rather than reactively. Understand how anxiety affects financial decisions Studies have shown that anxiety has an adverse effect on almost all our financial decisions. Stress can make us spend more, save less, and rack up credit card debt. Kind of like stress eating, we think spending will make us feel better. Saving, however, can provide you with peace of mind that you can better handle unexpected expenses, adapt to changes in income or take advantage of new opportunities. The best way to feel better right now might be to put unnecessary purchases on hold and save more. Put everyday money management on automatic If you haven't already, clear your mind and save time by using bill pay for regular monthly payments like mortgage, rent, utilities, phone, internet, car loans, student loans, even credit cards. All these can be paid automatically through your bank so you don't have to stress about missing a payment. (It might even qualify you for some discounts!) You just have to make sure you have the money in your checking account to cover them. Do the same for your savings. If you have a 401(k), you're already saving for retirement automatically. You can set up regular payments from checking to savings accounts for your other savings goals. Share your fears Still waking up at night with worry? Talk it out. If you have a spouse or partner, work through your financial fears—and your solutions—together. Whether it's your partner, a family member or a trusted friend, listening to another perspective may help you think more clearly. And sharing your concerns and voicing your questions can help you come up with a plan of action. Which brings me to my next point. Reach out to an advisor For added peace of mind, consider talking to a financial advisor or financial planner. There's a misconception that advisors are only for the wealthy. Not so. A financial advisor can help you see beyond today's struggles and feel more confident in the future. And everyone can benefit from that. From everyday budgeting to proper insurance to long-term goal setting for things like retirement or a child's education, a financial planner can make suggestions on how to prioritize your current needs, and outline steps you can take now toward future goals. Even a one-time consultation could offer you a helpful course of action. Plus, there's a whole range of financial advice available to fit any budget. The Foundation for Financial Planning is even working to expand pro bono counseling to vulnerable populations including low-income individuals and families, military personnel and veterans, domestic violence survivors, and people affected by natural disasters like COVID-19 or serious medical crises. Rather than worry about the unknown—prepare for it Coming up with a plan of action during uncertain times can seem counter-intuitive. How can you plan ahead if you don't know what's coming? By being flexible. Think of a plan as more of a process that will evolve over time as your goals, your life and the world around you change. It's a way to replace worry with preparation. To me, the best way to be prepared for whatever the future holds is to follow some tried and true money management principles: spend wisely, set goals, save for emergencies, and invest for the long-term. These are the knowns you can count on to help you reach your financial goals in both good times and bad. Do it for your health While we may not be consciously aware of it, money worries can be detrimental to our physical and emotional health. Conversely, it's been shown that staying on top of our money can have positive side effects. For instance, savings can act as an emotional buffer to reduce anxiety. A financial plan can give you more confidence and help you stay focused. So just as you try to keep physically fit during this particularly difficult time, make a carefully thought out effort to keep yourself financially fit. You don't have to do everything at once, but each extra step you take to manage your money will make you feel that much better—mentally, physically and financially. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, By the time you\\'ve been paying taxes for decades, you get it. The tax code is absurdly complicated and enough to make any of us (myself included) want to run for cover. On the other hand, like me, you probably want to be a good citizen and pay your fair share but not a penny more. Unfortunately, these two realities don\\'t fit together. Just completing your tax return every year can be a monumental task. And figuring out how to manage your tax bill takes even more work. It takes long-term planning, short-term decisions, and a solid understanding of tax concepts. I\\'ll go over some basics here, but I also highly recommend that you enlist the ongoing help of a great CPA, particularly as you first move into retirement. When it comes to taxes, there are both advantages and disadvantages to being a retiree. On the plus side, you may have more control over your income, and therefore more strategies for controlling your taxes. On the minus side, you may well have more at stake, and certainly more to think about. Understand How Different Types of Income Are Taxed Before I get into strategies, it\\'s important to understand how the IRS categorizes (and taxes) different types of income. In the eyes of the IRS, there are three major categories of income, which are taxed as follows: Ordinary income—From wages, self-employment, interest, dividends, etc. Taxation—In 2022, ordinary income is taxed at a marginal rate ranging from 0 percent to 37 percent, with the highest earners paying the most. Note, though, that some interest income is tax-exempt (for example, interest from state and local municipal bonds), and some dividends are considered qualified and therefore receive special long-term capital gains tax treatment. Capital income—From the sale of property. Capital gains and losses can either be short-term (held for one year or less) or long-term (held for more than one year). There are also special categories for things such as collectibles. Taxation—Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. In 2022, long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are not taxable for single filers with up to $40,400 and married filers with less than $80,800 in taxable income. For married filers with taxable income between $80,801 and $501,600 and single filers who have taxable income between $40,401 and $445,850, long-term capital gains and dividends are taxed at 15 percent. For single filers with taxable income over $441,450 or $469,600 for married filing jointly, long-term capital gain and qualified dividend income over that amount is taxed at 20 percent. A 3.8 percent Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) applies to individuals, estates, and trusts that have net investment income above applicable threshold amounts ($250,000 for married filing jointly or qualifying widow and $200,000 for single filers). Long-term capital gains on collectibles are taxed at 28 percent. Passive income—From investments in real estate, limited partnerships, or business activities where participation is \"immaterial.\" Taxation—Ordinary income tax rate. Passive losses can usually only off set other passive income, not ordinary income. Marginal vs. Effective (Or Average) Tax Rate Because taxes are progressive, meaning that we pay a proportionately larger amount of taxes on higher levels of income, there are two tax rates that you need to be aware of: your marginal rate and your effective rate. Your marginal tax rate is the amount of tax you pay on your last dollar of income. For example, in 2022 if you\\'re married filing jointly and in the 22 percent tax bracket, you will pay $22 in taxes for every $100 of taxable income above $83,550 and up to $178,150. This is important, so that you will know, for example, how a bonus or other extra income is taxed. Your effective tax rate is the average tax rate you pay when you take all of your income into account. This is important, for example, if you\\'re figuring out the tax impact of an investment. Your effective rate (also known as the average rate) is most likely lower than your marginal rate. At a Glance: How Retirement Income is Taxed Social Security benefits—Up to 85 percent of benefits taxed at your ordinary income rate. Singles—Income less than $25,000, benefits not taxed; income $25,000–$34,000, 50 percent of benefits taxed; income over $34,000, 85 percent taxed. Married filing jointly—Income less than $32,000, benefits not taxed; income $32,000–$44,000, 50 percent of benefits taxed; over $44,000, 85 percent taxed. Pension income—Fully or partially taxed as ordinary income, depending on whether contributions were tax-deferred. Annuity income—Fully or partially taxed as ordinary income, depending on whether contributions were tax-deferred. Traditional 401(k) Distributions—Fully taxable as ordinary income. Traditional deductible IRA distributions—Fully taxable as ordinary income. Traditional nondeductible IRA distributions—Withdrawals of contributions tax-free, earnings taxable as ordinary income. Roth IRA and Roth 401(k) distributions—Tax-free provided you are 59½ and the funds have been in the account for at least five years. Taxable account—Taxes are assessed annually based on the different kinds of income (ordinary, capital, passive) generated by the investments during the year. When an investment is sold, it is taxed as short- or long-term capital gains (or losses). Interest from municipal bonds is exempt from federal income tax, but gets added back for computing taxability of Social Security benefits (however, interest from \"private activity\" bonds could be included when computing the alternative minimum tax). Income from Treasury bills and bonds is exempt from state (but not federal) income tax. Investment income from interest, dividends, royalties, gains and passive income may also be subject to the 3.8 percent Net Investment Income Tax for high earners. Be Smart About Where You Place Your Investments I\\'ve said it repeatedly: As an investor, your first priority is your asset allocation. Next comes diversification and your individual security selection. But paying attention to your taxes is important, too. To minimize taxes, and therefore maximize what you actually get to keep, put your most tax-efficient investments (those that lose less of their return to taxes) in your taxable accounts and your least tax-efficient investments (those that lose more of their return to taxes) in your tax-deferred accounts—as shown in the following. Taxable accounts are the best place for: Individual stocks you plan to hold for more than one year Tax-managed stock funds, index funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and low turnover stock funds Stocks or mutual funds that pay qualified dividends Municipal bonds and I Bonds Tax deferred accounts such as traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are the best place for: Individual stocks you plan to hold one year or less Actively managed funds that may generate significant short-term capital gains Taxable bond funds, zero-coupon bonds, inflation-protected bonds (TIPS) and high-yield bond funds Real estate investment trusts (REITS) Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k)s are the best place for: Assets that you believe have the greatest chance for the largest return Assets that are the least tax efficient SMART MOVE: If you believe that you will be in a higher tax bracket at a later date (for example, if you\\'re currently delaying Social Security or if you\\'re expecting an inheritance), you can consider converting all or part of your IRA to a Roth IRA. Not only will your eventual withdrawals be tax-free, there also will be no RMDs. Plus, converting your account to a Roth can be a boon to your heirs. Keep in mind taxes are due at the time of conversion and there are other considerations, so check with a professional before doing a conversion. Be Tax-Wise as You Withdraw Your Income To the extent that you rely on income from your portfolio, it\\'s important to consider taxes as you sell investments and withdraw funds. In a nutshell, it\\'s generally best to: Sell from your taxable accounts before tapping your tax-deferred accounts. Sell securities from overweighted asset classes. Sell lower-rated securities before higher-rated securities. If you need to sell high-rated securities from your taxable accounts, sell those that will generate a loss before those that will generate a gain. When it comes to taxes, it\\'s essential to think long-term. But you can have an impact by thinking year-to-year as well. For example, if you\\'ve made a large charitable contribution or have paid extraordinary medical bills, you might be able to take a larger distribution without increasing your taxes. Conversely, you might want to reduce your distributions in a year with unusual income. Harvest Your Losses from Your Taxable Accounts No one wants their investments to lose money. But tax-loss harvesting can turn a loss into a plus, if not an out-and-out win. Here\\'s how the process works: When you sell your investments in a taxable account, you can reduce your taxable capital gain with a capital loss. Both capital gains and capital losses are categorized as either short-term (for an investment that you\\'ve owned for one year or less) or long-term (for an investment that you\\'ve owned for more than a year), which means that almost every sale will create one of the following four results: Long-term capital gain (LTCG) Long-term capital loss (LTCL) Short-term capital gain (STCG) Short-term capital loss (STCL) You net these out with the following three steps: Net your LTCGs against your LTCLs Net your STCGs against your STCLs Net your long-term result against your short-term result to arrive at a single taxable figure Example: In one year, Sam sold several investments in his taxable accounts, resulting in: LTCG: $11,000 LTCL: $6,000 STCG: $5,000 STCL: $6,000 He nets them out as follows: LTCG $11,000 and LTCL $6,000 _ LTCG $5,000 STCG $5,000 and STCL $6,000 _ STCL $1,000 LTCG $4,000 This long-term gain then receives the preferential long-term capital gain rate. However, if the netting process resulted in a capital loss, up to $3,000 can be deducted against ordinary income. Any amount over $3,000 can be carried over as a deduction in future years. CAUTION: If you decide to sell a stock or mutual fund to take a tax loss, but you know that you want to buy it back at a future date, watch out for the wash-sale rule. If you sell a security at a loss and buy the same or a \"substantially identical\" security within thirty days, the loss is generally disallowed for tax purposes. SMART MOVE: If you make a partial sale, your broker is required to report the cost basis for stocks purchased after January 1, 2011. The default method is FIFO, or \"first in, first out.\" Instead, you may be able to minimize taxes by specifying shares with a higher cost basis. Plan Your Charitable Gifts with Taxes in Mind As you plan charitable contributions, there\\'s no harm in lowering your tax bill at the same time. For example, think about the following: You can deduct a percentage of your adjusted gross income for contributions to qualified charitable organizations above the standard deduction if you itemize. The amount depends on the type of asset you give and the type of institution you give. In 2020 under the CARES Act you can deduct up to $300 in cash to qualifying charities if you take the standard deduction ($600 for joint filers). Giving appreciated stock instead of cash. If you donate appreciated stock that you\\'ve owned for more than a year, this can be a win-win for you and the recipient. If you sell appreciated stock, you will owe capital gains tax. But you can gift the stock tax-free to a qualified charity plus potentially receive a charitable tax deduction equal to its full market value. Caution, though: If you\\'ve owned the stock for one year or less, it\\'s considered a short- term holding and you\\'ll be able to deduct only the purchase price, not the full market value. Conversely, it\\'s better to sell depreciated stock before you donate the proceeds. This way you can realize a capital loss, which you can either use on your current year\\'s taxes or bank for future years. Plus, you can still claim the value of the gift as a charitable deduction. If you\\'re 70½ or older, you can make a direct contribution to a charitable organization from your IRA without paying any tax. The downside is that you can\\'t also claim a charitable deduction for this donation. However, it can count toward your RMD.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I recently inherited a traditional IRA from my father. Can I cash out just some of the money if I need it, or do I have to take it all out now? —A Reader Dear Reader, I’m sorry to hear of your loss. As I’m sure you know, an inheritance can bring up conflicting emotions, placing the positive of financial gain against the sadness of losing a loved one. Complicating the situation further, certain inheritances—such as an IRA—are more difficult to sort out than others. In addition, changes under the SECURE Act passed in 2019 mean new options beginning in 2020. A beneficiary’s relationship to the deceased and when he or she inherited the IRA will determine exactly what those options are. Spouse versus non-spouse beneficiaries The first thing to understand is that IRA inheritance rules differ depending on whether the beneficiary is a spouse or non-spouse. A spouse has almost limitless options, including treating an inherited IRA as his or her own, even to the extent of converting it to a Roth. A non-spouse beneficiary like yourself, however, generally has much more limited choices. As a non-spouse, you can either take the IRA money in a lump sum or, in some cases, as required minimum distributions (or a combination of both). Required minimum distributions for inherited assets before 2020 For retirement accounts inherited by a non-spouse before 2020, the proceeds can be distributed over your lifetime (often referred to as “stretch IRAs”). Taking mandatory withdrawals over time can ease your tax burden, but the process is a bit more complicated than taking a lump sum. The first thing you have to do is open an inherited IRA in the name of the original account holder for your benefit. Just like the original account holder, you won't be taxed on the assets until you take a distribution, so your tax hit is spread out. There is no 10 percent penalty for early withdrawals. After that, you may have one more choice to make depending on your father’s age when he passed away. Here, in a nutshell, are your options: If your father was under 70½ when he died, you have two options for taking distributions: The Life Expectancy method, in which you must take an annual required minimum distribution (RMD) spread over your own life expectancy, based on IRS life-expectancy tables and determined by your age in the calendar year following the year of your father’s death. Distributions must begin no later than December 31 of the year after the year of death, and will be reevaluated each year. Of course, you can always take more than the RMD if you wish. The Five-Year method, which allows you to take distributions of any amount at any time up until December 31 of the fifth year after the year your father died, at which time all assets must be fully distributed. If your father was over 70½, you must use method number one, the Life Expectancy method. The five-year option doesn't apply. And one more thing: with the Life Expectancy method, if your father didn't take an RMD in the year of his death, you must take an RMD by December 31 of that year. Note that the new rules under the SECURE Act do not affect existing inherited accounts. They only apply to accounts that are inherited in 2020 and beyond. Required minimum distributions for inherited assets after 2020 Under the new SECURE Act, retirement assets must be distributed within ten years if the IRA owner died on or after January 1, 2020. In other words, you can take all or part or none any given year, as long as it’s all distributed by 10 years. However, there are exceptions for spouses, minor children, disabled individuals and persons less than ten years younger than the decedent. These individuals—sometimes referred to as ‘eligible designated beneficiaries’—can still withdraw or “stretch” out funds on the basis of life expectancy allowing them to defer distributions from inherited retirement accounts for a longer period of time. (Once minors reach the age of majority he or she will need to distribute the entire account within 10 years.) The age of the decedent when he or she died doesn’t matter. If you take the assets as a lump sum As I mentioned, as a non-spouse, you can take the assets all at once. The upside is that you have access to all the money right away, and there's no 10 percent penalty for early withdrawals. The downside is that you'll have to pay income tax on the distribution at your ordinary income tax rate, which could be quite a sum depending on the amount of the inheritance. Another concern is that the distribution itself could bump you into a higher tax bracket, increasing the amount of taxes you have to pay. Therefore, a lump sum may not be the most tax- efficient way to access the assets. Looking at the positive As you can see, there's a lot to think about. I suggest talking to your tax advisor before making a choice. You could also consult IRS Publication 590, which goes into greater detail on all aspects of IRA withdrawals. While the rules are complex, taking mandatory withdrawals under even an accelerated ten-year time table does have its benefits. For one, the undistributed assets can keep growing tax-deferred—which can be a significant boost over time. This choice also allows you to manage the assets according to your own goals and time horizon. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'Keeping your credit score high is important for your financial life—and maybe also for your love life.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, Imagine this scenario: Over a wonderful dinner, you and your sweetheart have discussed the future, what you each want out of life, your dream house, the possibility of a family, and everything seems to be pointing to your happiness. Then the love of your life graciously offers to pick up the tab, hands over a credit card—and the card isn't accepted. And then a second credit card gets the same response. Oops. Should warning bells go off? Or at least a caution light? I've always believed that finance and romance should go hand-in-hand and that couples need to be as open and honest about their financial feelings as they are about everything else. In fact, a study by researchers at the Brookings Institution, the Federal Reserve Board and UCLA narrows the financial focus for couples down to a very quantifiable number: your credit score. The study proposes that matching high credit scores can indicate not only financial compatibility but also a stronger level of commitment in a relationship. So I thought I'd give my readers' love lives a potential boost by talking about the best way to boost their credit scores. Because if there's one thing that can dampen the romance in a relationship, it's not being able to get that loan or that mortgage—or even that perfect job—due to lousy credit. Five steps to better credit Before we get into how to build a better credit score, let's talk about why it's important. Your credit score isn't just about your ability to borrow money. It can affect many aspects of your life. Some companies use credit scores in making hiring decisions, landlords can use credit scores to screen rental applicants, and some insurance companies use your credit score to help determine your premium. Negative credit information generally stays on your credit report for seven to ten years, so mishandling credit today can haunt you for years to come. What can you do now? If you don't know your current score, you can purchase it from one of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion). Or better yet, some financial institutions will provide credit scores for free, so be sure to check with your provider first. To put things in perspective, the top FICO® score is 850; the average is about 706; and 760 or higher will typically qualify you for the best deals. Then, whatever your score, take these steps to keep it as high as possible: Pay your bills on time—Paying your bills on time and in full where possible is the best thing you can do. This alone accounts for about 35 percent of your score. Use credit cards with care—How much and how often you borrow makes up 30 percent of your score. Keep your credit card balances low, no more than 25 percent of your available limit. Increase the length of your credit history—The longer you have credit (and use it wisely), the better your score. Your history accounts for about 15 percent of your score. Minimize new credit requests—Applying for multiple credit cards or loans in a given period of time can lower your score. New credit requests account for 10 percent. Hold different kinds of credit—About 10 percent of your score depends on the type of credit used. A consumer with revolving debt (i.e., credit cards), a car loan, and a mortgage, and who keeps up payments, will have a higher score than someone who uses just one form of credit. Keep in mind that there’s more than just one credit score and there’s more than one credit rating agency. Scoring model formulas and algorithms also periodically change, but following these five guidelines will help keep you on the right track. Why couples should talk about this I believe that good communication about money helps build strong relationships. Being honest and open about your feelings and experiences about borrowing money and using credit can help your relationship grow. If one partner in a relationship can't handle debt, consistently runs up bills he or she can't pay, or regularly falls behind on everyday financial obligations resulting in a low credit score, that can be a harbinger of future financial problems—and perhaps future relationship problems as well. Making a good financial match So if you and your partner are lovingly planning your future together, make sure you're also financially compatible. Talk about your finances and your individual expectations. Lay it all out on the table: what you own, what you owe, your individual and mutual financial goals, and how you'll share every-day and long-term financial responsibilities. Get your personal credit scores. If one of you has a lower score, talk about why, what this means, and how you can work together to raise it. Whether it's saving, paying off debt, buying a house or paying for a child's education, today's perfect romance will be affected by the future financial issues of having a life together—for better or worse. You can make it better by talking about these issues now, boosting your individual credit scores, and perhaps, at the same time, increasing your chances for a long and happy relationship.

To me this positive, practical theme is a perfect segue into not only understanding how money management skills affect your happiness, but also reinforcing the practical steps you can take to help yourself stay healthy financially and emotionally. Because even when external events are seemingly out of control, there are a number of things you can do personally to keep yourself on an even keel. The emotional side of money Think you\\'re the only one who sometimes feels overwhelmed by money worries? Absolutely not. According to a 2019 survey by CompareCards.com, 7 in 10 Americans say they\\'ve cried over something related to their finances. And money was an emotional trigger regardless of age or gender. A 2018 Harris poll found that money was a major source of stress for 44 percent of respondents. The specific causes included low income, the rising cost of healthcare, too much debt, and lack of retirement saving. A Schwab Retirement Survey found that 42 percent of people surveyed who aren’t contributing to their company-provided 401(k) plan said keeping up with monthly bills was the biggest challenge. These findings are troubling not just because a significant percentage of Americans are struggling with money concerns, but because of what those concerns can do to the rest of your life. Financial anxiety affects more than your bottom line There have been a number of studies that show how financial insecurity leads to a host of other problems. Financial issues are linked not only to stress and anxiety in general but also lead to poor physical health and reduced job performance. As we all know, worries about the cost of healthcare are high. There\\'s even an expression in the medical world for the problems a patient has paying medical bills—\"financial toxicity.\" In other words, worrying about large bills and debt can actually make you sick and even increase the amount of pain you feel! When financial stress hits close to home, it can cause relationship problems between spouses, parents and kids, even friends. Childhood poverty has been shown to have far reaching effects on kids\\' physical and mental health. But while there are a lot of concerning statistics, there\\'s some good news too. A 2015 Gallup poll about the link between relationship problems and financial well-being noted that the solution to reducing stress and increasing financial security wasn\\'t as much about the amount of money you have, but more about how well you manage your money. And that\\'s something you can control. Things you can do to feel financially more secure and emotionally better Worry is caused by uncertainty. And while you can\\'t know what the future will bring, you can take steps to get a better handle on the present, and better prepare yourself for whatever lies ahead. Here are some basic money management tips that are important for everyone to review: Know where your money is going—Write down your monthly expenses. How much are you spending on essentials like housing, food and transportation? How much are you spending on extras? Make adjustments so that you don\\'t spend more than you earn. Get a handle on debt—If you\\'re carrying credit card balances, create a payment plan you can stick with. Try to pay more on higher interest debt first, being sure to pay at least the minimum on all debts, including student loans. Plan for emergencies—Aim to put aside enough cash to cover 3-6 months essential expenses in a savings or money market account. Starting from scratch? Aim for $1,000-$2,000 and work your way up from there. Boost your savings—Make savings a part of your monthly budget. Even a small amount saved on a regular basis can make a big difference. Contribute to your 401(k)—Contribute at least enough to get the company match, more if you can. Take advantage of workplace financial wellness programs—See what your company offers in terms of retirement planning, healthcare, and financial education and planning. Money management and happiness There\\'s one more Gallup poll that I find particularly positive. It found that among Americans worried about paying bills, 63 percent said they enjoyed saving more than spending. And I couldn\\'t agree more. Saving as much as you can, controlling your expenses, and feeling like you\\'re in control can reduce your financial stress and help you maintain a positive attitude no matter what life throws your way.

       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, With so many families around the country facing financial challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, I'd like to devote this column to discussing ways that we, as parents, can best help our kids through these challenging times. One of the most insidious parts of this pandemic is that it has undermined our sense of personal safety. For millions of Americans, the toll of medical, emotional, and financial stress is piling up. And it's not just impacting adults; our kids, regardless of whether they're 5 or 15, are likely feeling the effect as well. And although I can't offer a cure-all, I CAN offer one powerful remedy: TALK. Trust me, I know talking about money can be hard. We assign all sorts of values to money—whether that's success, love, security, or even self-worth. Many of us come with our own baggage, which can further complicate things. But the good news is that once you understand and overcome these obstacles and are able to have open, honest, and nonjudgmental conversations about your finances, the resulting clarity and confidence can be powerful, both for you and for the rest of your family. First get a handle on your finances—and your emotions Before you start talking to your kids, it's best to do some prep work on your own. If like so many Americans you're facing a reduced income, there are lots of positive steps you can take to manage your new situation. Although your income may be reduced, it's possible some of your expenses have gone down as well. Or perhaps you have an opportunity to redirect money away from some nonessential extras to focus on higher priorities. As a short-term strategy, you may be able to reprioritize your bills, and take advantage of government benefits and programs that have been designed to assist families in need. If you have a partner, make sure you’re both on the same page. Go over your budget together, and talk out any differences. It won't help if you tell your kids one thing, and your partner has a different take. My hope is that once you've gone through these steps and made a plan, you'll start to feel a little better and a lot more in control. But be sure to address your feelings. In times like this it's natural to feel frightened and anxious. And if you’re overly anxious, your children will pick up on it—and that can only make them fearful as well. So take some time to talk through any stress with your partner, friends, or a trusted professional. And then, once you feel grounded, you'll be in better shape to open up the conversations with your children. Tailor your conversations to your kids' individual needs This may sound obvious, but the kinds of conversations you have with your kids should depend on their age, developmental level, and personality. Some kids like details, others respond better to ideas or general thoughts. Some are more anxious than others. You know your kids better than anyone else, so work with that knowledge. Offer up as much detail as you think appropriate I'm always in favor of being honest. If your teen is responsible and wants to know how you'll cover the rent, tell them. If it means you aren't able to pay into their college fund for a few months, perhaps let them know. In fact, depending on your child, sharing your entire budget—explaining where you're cutting back and why—could provide a valuable lesson in personal finance. That said, as you share details, try to be reassuring. The message you want to send is that you're in control. Even if your family needs to cut back for the time being, let your kids know that the situation isn't permanent. Also emphasize that you're not in this alone, that families across the country are making changes now to ensure a better future. Be open to their questions Money conversations should be a two-way street, between parents, between parent and child, and even between children. Make it really clear to your kids that you’re ready to answer their questions any time. If they're worried about something, make sure they know you want to hear about it. And if you have a child who may be reluctant to speak up, you can start the conversation yourself. However and whenever issues come up, take the time to sit down with your children and listen. Let them know you have all the time in the world for them—because at the end of the day, they are your highest priority, and they need to know that. Share your priorities Money management starts with a budget and then setting priorities. It's never a good idea to spend mindlessly, but this may just be the perfect time to refocus on what’s most important to you, and make sure that’s where your money is going. This type of prioritization can also be a valuable lesson for your kids. If you explain to them, for example, that you decided not to buy a new car because it's more important to fund their education, that's a powerful message. Or if you're putting a major purchase on hold to help their grandparents pay their bills, that's another important illustration of your values. Look to a brighter future Even though money may be tight now, help your children look to the future. If your young children get an allowance or get paid for chores, talk to them about saving it for future goals. Perhaps they want to buy a bike or save up for a special adventure. Older kids might want to save for a bigger goal like a new computer or music lessons. The point is that by looking beyond the current crisis, we also keep our spirits up, envisioning a brighter future. There's no question that people all over the world are being tested in ways we never thought possible. My hope is that families and communities will find strength in themselves and each other, staying connected through many, many conversations—about their fears, their hopes, their joys, and yes, about money.

       "   'abstract': \"Veterans often face significant financial challenges as they return to civilian life. Here's how you can help them.\",\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My son joined the Army right out of high school with the idea of a military career. After 12 years and two tours of duty, he's decided to return to civilian life. I've been reading that vets can face financial problems once they're on their own. Can you share your thoughts on the ways he can get a firm financial footing? —A Reader Dear Reader, Making any type of career change has its financial challenges, but the obstacles—financial and otherwise—that many veterans face as they re-enter civilian life go beyond the ordinary. And it's not only veterans who have financial concerns. According to the Blue Star Families 2019 Military Family Lifestyle Survey, financial issues are the top stressor among active service members and military spouses, as well. But for veterans transitioning to civilian life, the financial stresses can be even greater. For instance, a 2016 survey of participants in the National Foundation for Credit Counseling's (NFCC) Sharpen Your Financial Focus® program found that military veterans held higher auto, credit card and mortgage debt than other participants. And debt is only one aspect of a veteran's new financial reality. According to military.com, financial literacy in general is an ongoing concern for vets. On the positive side, there are a number of financial literacy services available specifically tailored to veterans' needs. I've included a few of them at the end of this column. However, rather than just point your son to an outside resource, you can definitely play a part in helping him become aware of the financial steps he can take to get on the right track. Financial basics for veterans—and everyone The basics of setting up a secure financial foundation are the same for everyone. Some things are obvious, others not. To help your son get started, I suggest having an open and honest conversation about certain financial fundamentals, including: The importance of insurance—One of the most important first steps is securing adequate health insurance. As soon as your son leaves active service, he should contact the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to apply for enrollment in health benefits. While he may have access to VA health facilities and medical care as a veteran, he'll need to look into longer-term health insurance if he has a family. In separating from service he'll also no longer have life insurance unless he converts his Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) to Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI) or has private and/or group life insurance coverage as a civilian. Disability insurance is something he will also need to protect his financial future. Building a good credit score—Establishing good credit and a good credit rating is a necessity. Encourage your son to stick to one or two credit cards, ideally with low interest and no fees, and to charge only what he can pay off each month. Talk to him about the importance of limiting the amount of credit he uses and paying bills on time. This will help him build a good credit score, which can in turn help him get a lower interest rate on a car loan or mortgage. In certain circumstances, a credit score can sway a landlord's choice of a tenant. Plus, credit history can also potentially affect job opportunities. Having an emergency fund—Having enough cash to cover three-to-six months of living expenses in an accessible savings account is essential for everyone. It won't earn much interest, but it will be there if and when your son needs it. Creating a budget—Sticking to a budget can be a challenge for everyone, but particularly for someone who isn't used to handling the details. Help your son list his essential expenses, such as housing, food, clothes, utilities, insurance, phone, Internet and transportation. Then have him list nonessentials such as entertainment and travel. You may take these things for granted, but he may be surprised at all the different expenses he'll now have to cover—and the choices he may need to make. Avoiding scams and deceptive financial practices—A 2017 AARP study found that veterans are twice as likely as other citizens to be the victims of financial fraud. According to this study, an astounding 80 percent of vets report having been targeted by financial scammers. In fact, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) received more than 34,000 complaints between October 2018 and September 30, 2019 alone from veterans and their families who were the target of scams and illegal and deceptive financial practices. Your son can learn how to protect himself by visiting the CFPB website, which also includes information specific to veterans leaving the service. Saving for the future—Now that he's a civilian, your son's future is in his own hands. Talk to him about his goals, both short- and long-term. If you can get him to make saving—and eventually investing—a regular part of his financial life, you'll be helping him not only avoid future pitfalls, but achieve future dreams. Financial literacy resources especially for veterans As I mentioned, there's a keen awareness of the financial pitfalls that veterans face. Fortunately, there are several services specifically designed to help veterans handle their new financial responsibilities. Here are just a few: Transition Assistance Program (TAP) is an extensive program designed for servicemembers separating from the military covering everything from finding a career, going back to school, or starting a small business. Military.com has a whole range of information for vets, from benefits to jobs to personal finance. Veterans Financial Coalition brings together a diverse group of organizations with the shared goal of serving the financial education and consumer protection needs of veterans. Veterans Plus offers financial literacy programs designed and delivered by veterans, including one-on-one personalized phone coaching, and military and veterans' family outreach. The National Financial Educators Council provides complimentary financial literacy resources, training and support to organizations that serve veterans and active duty military personnel. These are just some of the programs available. You may find others by researching veterans' services organizations in your own area. Best of luck to your son. I appreciate that after years of serving his country, adjusting to the day-to-day financial obligations of civilian life as well as planning for the long-term can be a difficult transition. And I want to thank him—and all military personnel as well as their families—for the service they provide and the sacrifices they make. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'From small personal gestures to larger contributions, if you want to give back, now is a perfect time.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, From singing on the balcony to community cheers for those on the front lines to young people grocery shopping for elderly neighbors, people around the world are reaching out in support of others during these difficult days. If there's a bright spot to what we're all going through, it's that a crisis seems to bring out a positive side of our human spirit—the desire to help. Today, with so many people facing extraordinary personal and financial challenges, there are lots of ways for all of us to help. From small personal gestures to larger contributions, if you have the desire to give back to your community, now is a perfect time. Show your appreciation by giving what you can While many of us stay safely at home, there are others performing extra services. Are you having your groceries delivered? Ordering take-out? Tip generously. Or how about buying gift cards from a small business or restaurant? Whatever and however you give, any extra dollars you add will be greatly appreciated—and are well deserved by those out there risking their own safety for the good of others. There are also many people who help us in our everyday lives whose incomes have taken a big hit—people like nannies, housekeepers and landscapers. If you have the means, consider keeping them on your personal payroll. If that's not possible, consider offering to pay them something in advance until things get back to normal. The extra money you can afford to give will mean a tremendous amount to the individuals you pay. But don't overstretch your finances; give only what you can. Even a little can mean a lot. And the fact that you care enough to offer may mean even more. Small personal gestures have a big impact Of course, it isn't always about giving money. Check with older neighbors to see if they need something from the market or the pharmacy and offer to pick it up for them. A friend of mine in her 70s made such an offer to her 90-year-old neighbors. Then she was offered the same courtesy by some 50-year-olds who live across the street! No matter your age or your need, just knowing that someone else is willing to look out for you can make all the difference. Supporting your community expands your reach As incomes are reduced for many people, so are contributions to community charitable organizations like food banks and other services for families in need. If you're uncertain what exists in your community, do a little local research. Feeding America has a tool for finding your local food bank. Great Nonprofits can help you zero in on organizations in your area, giving you information about what they do and what they need. Also, think about the skills you have and how you could give of your time. Are you particularly tech savvy? Maybe you could offer assistance to teachers struggling to keep up with offering classes online. Are you good with a sewing machine? Sewing masks for friends, extended family or even local merchants could become a new specialty. Or consider reaching out to a local senior community. Helping isolated seniors could be as simple as making a phone call to say hello. It's easy to give locally or globally Many organizations are expanding their programs to meet specific COVID-19 related needs. Two that are particularly meaningful to me are DonorsChoose and Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA). DonorsChoose is helping teachers provide materials to their students now learning from home. BGCA has created a relief fund to provide meals, offer virtual learning and more. Global Giving is a crowdfunding organization currently providing COVID-19 relief. Organizations such as UNICEF and Save the Children focus specifically on helping kids around the world through this crisis. And of course there are so many more organizations in need of support. Do your research before you give—and beware of fraudsters If you're uncertain where to direct your contributions, want to zero in on a specific charity, or compare charitable organizations, sites such as Charity Navigator or Candid (formerly known as GuideStar) are excellent resources. You can get detailed information about the purpose, track record, financials and reliability of hundreds of nonprofits. They also provide advisories about charities that don't meet specific standards. And in a world where fraudsters are rampant, this is especially important. The Federal Trade Commission warns that fake charities and fundraisers use the same tactics to reach donors as legitimate charities, whether face-to-face, by email, phone or social media. It's especially important to do your research before giving out any personal information or making a donation. Make giving a tax-smart part of your financial plan I always encourage making giving a part of a financial plan. It's not only a way to share your good fortune, but also can have tax advantages for you and your family. To encourage giving and make it easier during the pandemic, the CARES Act provides a new “above the line” charitable contribution deduction of up to $300 if you claim the standard deduction in 2020-2021. For people who itemize deductions, it also expanded the limits on charitable contributions from 60 percent up to 100 percent of adjusted gross income for 2020-2021. Donor-advised funds are a great way to give today and tomorrow A donor-advised fund provides another great way to save on taxes at the same time that you contribute to causes you care about. You can donate cash or investment securities (like stocks) and then use the funds to make grants to most 501(c)(3) organizations. Any money not distributed may be invested, potentially increasing the amount available to give. While contributions to a donor-advised fund aren’t part of the CARES Act expanded charitable deduction limits, you can typically gift appreciated stock directly to your donor-advised fund without having to pay capital gains taxes. This can leave you with even more money to direct to your favorite charities. Your tax or financial advisor can help with the details. To me, giving back—no matter how you choose to do it—has a lot of benefits for both the giver and receiver. And in times like these it's especially important, not only as a financial strategy, but as a very personal gesture with immediate results that can have a lasting effect.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I just lost my job and received my final paycheck with a small amount of severance money. I’ll probably need the money over the next few months, especially if my job search takes a long time, but would like to invest it in the meantime. Where’s a good place to put it? –A Reader Dear Reader, I’m sorry to hear about you losing your job. It’s a difficult time for so many right now. Thankfully, though, the severance you received is a bit of a life raft. And although I understand your desire to invest these funds, my sense is that it would be better for you to prioritize safety over growth. Let’s walk through your options while you’re between jobs and may need access to the funds. Investing’s big three There are three major variables to consider any time you invest money: your natural ability to deal with risk, the amount of risk you can afford to take, and the amount of time until you will need your money. All three are important considerations. Therefore, even though you may temperamentally take risk in stride, you have to think about what it could mean to your finances if you lost some (or all) of this money. Also consider that the shorter your time frame, the more careful you have to be because you may not be able to ride out a decline. As you review your options below, your goal is to find the best balance between liquidity (how quickly and conveniently you can access your cash), safety (the return of your money), and yield (the return on your money). In general, the safer and more liquid the account, the lower the rate of return. And in your case, my feeling is that you should accept a lower return in order to safeguard what is now your emergency fund. Where to stash your emergency fund cash The following are all insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 per account holder, per bank, per ownership category and therefore considered very safe. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) insures checking and savings accounts at credit unions up to the same limits. Interest-bearing checking account—You can write checks and may have easy ATM access to your cash. Savings account—Withdrawals are typically limited to six per month (unless you go to the bank in person). These usually pay more interest than checking accounts. Money market deposit account—A high-yield savings account that may offer limited check writing privileges (over certain minimums) while generally providing higher yields than a checking account. Short-term certificate of deposit (CDs)—These offer higher yields, the longer the term to maturity. Penalties apply if you withdraw early. Alternatively, if you have a brokerage account, you could consider investing your money in a money market fund. Technically, these are a type of mutual fund that primarily focus on stability and capital preservation. The underlying investments are conservatively invested in very short-term IOUs. It's important to note that money market funds are not insured by the FDIC so it's possible to lose money, but they generally offer higher yields than the accounts above. Whatever type of accounts you use, each company's products differ, so it's important to ask questions to understand fees, interest rates, minimums, risks, and potential withdrawal restrictions. A look to the future Although it's understandably tempting to want your money to grow, my advice to everyone is to always maintain an emergency fund that will cover a minimum of three to six months’ worth of necessary expenses. And in times like the present, when we're facing exceptional challenges, a bigger fund that will cover a longer period of time may be even more prudent. For now, I strongly advise you to consider stashing your emergency fund cash in one of the accounts we’ve discussed. In the future, once your career is back on track and we're past the COVID-19 emergency, it will be time to consider putting your extra savings (beyond what you've earmarked for emergencies) in investments with more potential for growth. Despite the current crisis, I remain a firm believer in the power of investing to achieve our long-term goals. We will get past this crisis. But in the meantime, best to focus on keeping our families and essential savings safe.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I heard that there are some recent changes to FICO scores. What’s different, and how will it affect me? —A Reader Dear Reader, FICO scores are odd creatures. We’ve all heard of them, we may even worry about them, but few of us actually understand what they mean in practice or how they are calculated. And sometimes, as you point out, they can change—just adding to the confusion. Some good news, though, is that even though a few of the details have shifted, the foundational principles of credit scores remain the same. Let’s start with a few basics, discuss what’s changed, and then review the steps you can take to build and maintain your score. Why is FICO changing? Credit rating agencies periodically update their scoring methodologies to reflect improved analytics and new data. Lenders are now reassessing borrower risks. As a result, some banks and credit card companies are already pulling back in certain areas, lowering credit limits for consumers who have poor or shaky credit histories and tightening auto-loan underwriting by increasing borrowing rates. How is FICO changing? While the exact formulas used to calculate credit scores are proprietary, the new FICO score is reported to give more weight to rising levels of debt, higher debt utilization (the ratio of the amount you borrow relative to the amount of credit available to you), and late payments. Unsecured personal loans (those that don’t require collateral like a home or car) are also being reconsidered. On the positive side, individuals who have been making timely payments, paying off debt, and using less of their credit line may see their scores improve. Other recent changes to credit scoring models over the past few years have helped new borrowers with limited credit histories and individuals with tarnished credit histories by considering things like timely rent, utility, cell phone, and cable payments as well as bank account balances. Why your credit history is so important Your credit history and resulting credit score can affect more than your ability to borrow money. Banks, stores, employers, landlords, and insurance companies may all have an interest in your credit history. For example, a poor credit score can increase your costs for home and auto insurance. Late payments and collections can lower your credit score and therefore affect a landlord’s willingness to rent you a new home. Current and prospective employers may be able to use your credit history when doing a background check. This can impact your ability to get a job, your eligibility for a promotion, or your ability to keep a job. Ways to build and improve your credit score While it’s true that FICO scoring models have changed, the fundamentals of building and maintaining a good credit score remain basically the same. Don’t be late. Paying your bills on time has the biggest effect on your score. Be careful about how much you owe. Less is better. Increasing loan or credit card balances not only has a negative effect on your credit score, but increases the cost of carrying debt. Avoid maxing out lines of credit. Try and keep your debt to less than 30 percent of the amount you are able to borrow. Only apply for credit that you need. While it’s important to shop around, if you apply for a lot of credit over a short period of time, it may appear to lenders that your economic circumstances have changed negatively. Check your credit report at annualcreditreport.com at least once a year for errors. Your report won’t include your score, but it will show you your history and what creditors and other parties are seeing. Contact your creditors if you are facing difficulties due to COVID-19. This includes your landlord, mortgage, credit card, auto loan and insurance, student loan, utility companies, and other service providers. Alternative payment options including postponing payment, partial payments, or grace periods may be available to you under the new Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act without harming your credit. These options may not be automatic. Do not assume you are eligible for any relief options. Continue to monitor and protect your score It's essential to understand that your credit score acts as your proxy in the financial world. Your score is used to judge your financial stability and reliability. Therefore, regardless of how opaque the system may seem, or how the models may change, it’s important for you to do everything in your power to protect and enhance your score. If you currently have a good score, congratulations—and keep up the good work. If you have some dings in your credit history, take action, but be patient as it can take time for your score to improve. Be proactive. The time to act is now. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': \"Falling interest rates may have you thinking about refinancing your mortgage but here's what else to consider.\",\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, With interest rates so low, I'm thinking of refinancing my mortgage. What do I need to know? —A Reader Dear Reader, Interest rates are on a lot of people's minds these days. For savers, rising interest rates are a plus, but borrowers benefit more when interest rates are low. For homebuyers and existing homeowners with a mortgage, lower interest rates can mean saving thousands in interest charges. But whether it makes sense to refinance your own mortgage depends on several factors. What kind of mortgage do you have? There are two basic types of mortgages: fixed and variable. A fixed-rate mortgage locks in both your interest rate and monthly payments for the life of your loan. An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a hybrid, with a fixed interest rate for a specified initial term—say, five years—after which the interest rate may reset or fluctuate, typically depending on prevailing interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect fixed and adjustable mortgages differently. While adjustable rate mortgages may be affected by short-term rate changes, fixed mortgage rates tend to be more closely aligned with the 10-year Treasury note. Therefore, if you have an ARM, a decrease in the short-term federal funds rate may lower your rate. If you have a fixed-rate mortgage, you should instead pay attention to long-term bonds like the 10-year Treasury note. Although these rates are related, they aren’t the same and can act differently from one another. Sometimes they both may decrease, or both may increase. Or one may go up, while the other goes down. Bottom line, pay attention. When rates decline, you may have an opportunity to refinance either your fixed or adjustable mortgage at a lower rate. But rates aside, deciding whether or not to refinance depends on a lot of personal factors. So you first need to ask yourself some questions and look at some specifics. What's your goal? People refinance for a lot of reasons. Do you want to lower your monthly payment? Reduce the length of your mortgage? Take out extra money for home improvements? These are important initial questions. If decreasing your payment is a top priority and you can lower your interest rate by .5 to 1 percent, it's probably worth the effort. For instance, lowering the interest rate on a $350,000 30-year fixed mortgage by 1 percent could lower your monthly payment by about $300 a month. On the flip side, if your goal is to shorten the length of your mortgage and you refinance that amount for 15 years, your monthly payment would go up, but you'd save a considerable amount in interest over the life of the loan. How long will you be in the house? Refinancing usually involves paying points and fees. Points basically represent interest you pay upfront to get a lower rate on your loan. It's not uncommon for points and fees to add up to 3-6 percent of your loan. You can pay this out of pocket or, often times, add them to the balance of your loan. However you pay them, it will take time to get to the breakeven point where these additional costs are offset by the lower rates, so you have to think realistically about how long you intend to be in your home. If you plan to sell in the near future, the extra cost of refinancing may outweigh the monthly short-term savings. How much home equity do you have? Just like with the down payment on a first mortgage, if you have less than 20 percent equity in your home, you'll likely have to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI). PMI fees can range from less than half a percent up to about 1.5 percent of your loan. While that may not add a considerable amount to your payment, if your goal is to reduce your monthlies and you have very little equity, you may want to reconsider. Do the math As you can see, it becomes a numbers game. A good way to start is to run some different scenarios using an online mortgage refinance calculator. That way you can see how it all adds up and decide on the best combination of rate, monthly payments, costs and loan term for you. Be aware that to get the best rate, you need to have a good credit score, so you might want to get a head start by looking at your credit report at annualcreditreport.com. The higher your credit rating, the lower the interest rates you will qualify for. Also, take steps to pay down outstanding debt like credit card balances and be prepared to meet any unexpected closing costs. Take care to avoid opening any credit lines during the refinancing process. And if you're increasing your loan balance or shortening the loan term, each of which could increase your monthly payment, make sure you're being realistic about your ability to handle the new payment from your income. The last thing you want to do is to shortchange your retirement savings or emergency fund for the sake of your mortgage. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': \"Today's financial reality may mean creative budgeting, reducing expenses and getting help when needed. Here's how.\",\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, Today we often hear the phrase, \"extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.\" And while it\\'s usually used to refer to large scale problems and solutions, I think it can apply much closer to home as more and more people are faced with a fast-changing financial reality. It\\'s not just about the markets and investors. This new reality affects everyday decisions in how we spend, how we save, and how we protect ourselves and our families. To cope with this new reality, we have to think in new ways, reprioritize and get creative so that we make the most of the resources we have and potentially figure out how to make do with less. But when it comes to money, being creative doesn\\'t mean the old ways of managing are thrown out the window. On the contrary. To me, it means looking at tried and true methods and applying them creatively to your own situation, starting now. Because like so much in this precarious world we currently live in, getting a jump on the situation will help you better survive both in the short and the long term. Whether you\\'re trying to conserve your finances, need to adapt to a loss of income, or need some extra financial help, you have options. If your income is stable, rethink your budget to maximize your resources Don\\'t think of budgeting as \"doing without;\" think of it as doing your best. With restaurants, gyms and movie theaters closing in many parts of the country—at least for a while, you\\'ve probably been spending less. So if your income is stable, this is an opportunity to rethink your needs and wants, reprioritize your expenses, and plan better for the future. If the current situation doesn\\'t bring home the importance of being prepared for the unexpected, nothing will. If you\\'ve had trouble saving in the past, this could be an opportunity in disguise. Put what you don\\'t spend on today\\'s extras toward the future—whether that\\'s your emergency fund, retirement or a child\\'s education. And if, in the past, those \"extras\" caused you to overspend and get into debt, this is your chance to change those habits. Use this enforced saving to pay down your credit cards. If your income has dropped, try to lower fixed costs to make the most of what you have When changes in income make it hard to cover essentials, it\\'s not just a matter of rethinking your budget and eliminating extras, but of figuring out how to lower fixed costs. Here are some tangible ways to do that: Shop smart to lower food costs. The USDA has a website to help you make healthy, lower-cost choices. Review your utility bills to see if you can lower usage, and contact your providers about lower-cost options. Negotiate fees with cable and internet companies. Look at your cell phone usage and what you may be paying for things like unlimited data that you may not need. Cancel streaming or other services you don\\'t use. Review your auto insurance coverage and deductibles. If you’re not driving much, you may be able to lower your premiums. Actually, re-evaluating your fixed costs and looking for ways to save is a smart move at any time. You may find that the changes you make to cover today\\'s circumstances have long-term benefits, giving you more money to direct toward other goals when things get better and cash isn\\'t so tight. If you’re struggling to make ends meet, make a game plan for the short term Right now, a lot of people—especially gig workers, part-time employees, and those who\\'ve recently been laid off—are trying to figure out how to get through the next few months. First, review your resources and decide what you can cover. If you\\'ve depleted your savings but you\\'re still employed, take a hard look at any automatic savings plans. Consider deferring any savings for a child\\'s college education. And if you’re contributing more than the company match to a 401(k), you might reduce that percentage temporarily. Avoid borrowing if you can. Next, prioritize your bills, putting housing, utilities and health insurance at the top of the list. For the time being only, consider paying the minimum on credit card balances, car loans and student loans. Be extra careful about reducing or cutting any of your insurance coverage. That could wind up being penny-wise and pound foolish. Take advantage of extra help if you need it If cutting your budget isn\\'t enough to make ends meet in the current environment, take heart. More help could be available. For instance: If your income has been impacted by the pandemic, you may be able to lower or suspend your mortgage payments for up to one year in some cases. Contact your lender. If you\\'re having trouble paying your rent, talk to your landlord about your situation and your options. Some states and municipalities are providing eviction restrictions for impacted individuals. In response to COVID-19, federal law allows states to expand and increase unemployment benefits to more people, including a supplemental $600/week for up to four months. Apply at your state unemployment office. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires certain employers to provide employees with paid expanded family and medical leave related to COVID-19 through December 31, 2020. Talk to your employer. New laws make it possible for most federal borrowers to suspend student loan payments for two months. Contact your loan servicer. Many utilities and phone companies have stopped cutting off services for nonpayment. Call them. If you know you\\'re going to fall short, don\\'t just let bills become overdue. Reach out to providers and creditors. Under these unusual circumstances, many are willing to work with you, but it\\'s up to you to let them know. Think of the future It\\'s hard to think about the future when you\\'re struggling in the present, but try to keep looking forward. If you have income, be smart about every penny and if you can, keep saving. If you have kids, talk to them about how tightening your belt now will help you get back to normal when things turn around. Reach out to friends and family to get—and give—moral support. Don\\'t be shy about asking for help. While the present may seem a bit bleak, I believe the future is still bright.

       "   'abstract': 'Your feelings about risk can change in volatile markets, but consider your goals and timeframe before taking action.',\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, My husband and I plan to retire in the next five years or so. He thinks we should move away from stocks because they’re too risky, especially given all the recent market volatility. I don’t want to miss out on the potential for gains once the markets straighten out. What are your thoughts? —A Reader Dear Reader, It’s a fair question. While it will be several years before you'll need to rely on your investments for your retirement ‘paycheck,’ a bear market can quickly wipe out years of savings and investment gains, as we’ve recently experienced. On the other hand, once things turn around, a bull market can boost your ability to spend. My first reaction is that you and your husband are both correct. As investors, we continue to evolve depending on our circumstances, and retirement is when we might want to move away from the risks of the stock market. That said, many of us are fortunate enough to enjoy a long and active retirement, so will continue to benefit from having the potential for growth that stocks can provide. And regardless of your life stage or current market conditions, the basic investing principles of asset allocation, diversification, holding down costs, and regular rebalancing still hold. Let’s take a closer look at the steps you can take now to prepare for a secure future—no matter what the market does. First understand where you are now Before you make any changes to your investments, take inventory of where you are now. Start with your net worth—your assets (investments, cash savings, equity in your home or other real estate) minus any liabilities (all your debt, including your mortgage). Next, examine your annual cashflow by comparing your expenses to your income. Hopefully, you’re in the black, including annual savings since that's the key to any successful retirement. Have a clear plan Once you know where you stand, run the numbers (or rerun them if your plan hasn’t accounted for big changes) to see if you’re on track to reach your retirement goals. One general guideline is that you can safely withdraw about 4 percent of your portfolio with adjustments for inflation from a well-diversified portfolio (including around 30-60 percent in stocks) for approximately thirty years. To get more specific, I suggest you work with a financial professional to create a personalized financial plan that takes into consideration all aspects of your financial life. A financial planner can also help you examine options by running various “what-if” scenarios. Understand risk Every kind of investment has risks, just different kinds and levels. Nothing is risk free. When you and your husband discuss exposure to the stock market, you’re setting what financial professionals call your ‘asset allocation.’ This is important because your mix of assets plays the largest role in controlling the amount of risk and potential return in your portfolio. A portfolio heavily weighted in stocks has the most potential to grow, but also the biggest potential to lose value, especially in the short term. On the flip side, a portfolio that doesn’t include stocks will have very limited growth and increase the risk that your money won’t last your entire retirement. Cash has the least amount of risk over short periods of time, but the greatest long-term risk of losing value compared to inflation. Bonds fall somewhere in between and, like cash, may add ballast to your portfolio when investment seas get rough. Wise investing involves making choices that take into account these trade-offs. Stay diversified Another foundational principle of successful investing is diversification. Commonly described as “not putting all of your eggs in one basket,” it means owning different types of investments within each asset class. For example, a diversified portfolio of stocks would include large, small, foreign, and domestic companies in different sectors of the economy. This is because different investments are less likely to all go up or down at the same time. If your portfolio is concentrated in just a few individual stocks, you’re not diversified. Rebalance As markets shift, so will your portfolio. If the stock market has been on a tear, you’ll likely find yourself over weighted in stocks. On the flip side, if the stock market drops as it has recently, you can find yourself underweighted in stocks. What's one fix? Rebalancing. Rebalancing is a bit counter-intuitive because it involves selling things that have gone up and buying what’s not done so well. This is what's meant by “buy low and sell high.” Although there are no hard and fast rules about how often to rebalance, it’s smart to do it at least annually. Another approach is to rebalance if your portfolio is more than 5-10 percent out of alignment, as can happen when markets have dramatic swings. Rebalancing is simpler in tax sheltered accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s as there are no tax consequences. That said, when you rebalance a taxable account you may be able to lower your tax bill by taking advantage of ‘tax-loss harvesting.’ This is essentially selling an investment that has lost money and using that loss to reduce your taxable gains, potentially offsetting up to $3,000 of ordinary income. It's best to consult with a financial planner or tax professional to understand how this may work for you. Reduce costs Low expenses help improve your results no matter what the market does. Take time to understand investment fees, sales loads, commissions, and other account servicing fees. To get this information, read your prospectuses and statements carefully. If you have questions, consult with a trusted financial advisor. And if costs don’t look reasonable, look for lower cost alternatives. Maintain exposure to stocks and stay involved As you get older, it can make sense to gradually reduce how much you have in stocks. A general guideline is to have about 40-60 percent in stocks at your retirement date depending on your risk tolerance and individual circumstances. As you continue in retirement it's generally still wise to maintain at least 20-30 percent in stocks. The key is staying involved. If you have a well-thought-out plan and a balanced portfolio, rebalance on a regular basis, stay diversified, watch costs, and consult with a financial planner when you have questions, you’ll be well on your way to a financially secure retirement.

       "   'abstract': \"Themes of equality and opportunity during Women's History month reinforce the importance of financial independence.\",\n",
       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, As you may know, I'm a big champion of financial independence, and the month of March gives me a special opportunity to talk about the importance of women taking control of their finances. Why March? Two reasons. First, the entire month is declared Women's History Month, this year honoring women who have fought and still fight for voter rights. Second, Tuesday, March 8th is designated International Women's Day. Both urge women to engage and work for a more equitable world, whether in politics, business, or personal relations. I like the fact that these themes encourage women to be active and strong, and to use their talents to provide greater opportunities for everyone. And to me, one of the most effective means of doing that is through financial independence. I believe that by taking control of their finances, everyone can be not only individually strong, but also strong partners and strong members of their communities. However, for women it's even more important. For us, financial independence is more than a matter of strength; it's a matter of necessity. Take charge of your finances—take charge of your life Statistically we live longer than men and earn less. According to a 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics report, median weekly earnings for full-time salaried women are just 81 percent of what men earn. On top of that, we're often faced with discrimination in terms of wages and advancement opportunities. All of which means we have to work harder, save more, and be our own advocates. So I'd like to use this March to encourage women everywhere to take charge of their finances as an important step in negotiating a better situation for themselves and their families. To me, financial independence is empowering. By taking charge of your finances, you're taking charge of your life. Here are some ideas on how to do just that. 1. Make retirement a top priority Women are known to put others' needs first, but when it comes to retirement, you have to think of yourself. Take charge of your own financial future by taking full advantage of a company retirement plan. Contribute at least up to the company match, and much more if possible. Don't have a company plan? Open an IRA. The point is to save as much as you can, as soon as you can. Ideally you'll start in your twenties to save about 10-15 percent of your annual salary (including any contributions from your employer). If you start later, that percentage goes up precipitously. For instance, wait until age 40 and ideally you'd want to sock away 25-35 percent of your annual salary. That may sound like a lot, but retirement can be long—particularly for women. Many financial planners recommend that you anticipate living until 90-plus in retirement planning calculations. You need to be prepared. 2. Don't just save—invest Part of that preparation is making the most of your money, and that likely means investing. Your first thought may be that you don't want to take on the risk. But while stock market downs are definitely a reality, there's also a risk in being too cautious. Not investing in the stock market can mean missing out on long-term gains that can help you achieve your goals. For a goal like retirement with a long time horizon, you ideally want a diversified portfolio that has the potential for growth. This means having a portion of your money invested in the stock market and accepting the almost certain market swings. While that can sound daunting, it doesn't have to be if you keep your eyes focused on your end goal. And you don't have to go it completely alone. 3. Team up with an advisor When it comes to investing and managing your money, having a support team can be a great confidence booster. Even if you're just starting out—and especially as your assets grow—consider working with an advisor. I think of a financial advisor sort of like a personal trainer, someone to guide you and keep you going when you might feel overwhelmed or tempted to call it quits. An advisor can help you look at the big picture and build a portfolio to match your goals. Plus, working with an advisor who understands you can be a major source of peace of mind. So think about the type of person you'd be most comfortable with. A lot of women prefer to work with a female advisor. But gender aside, look for someone you can communicate with easily. Of course, how often you want to interact with an advisor is up to you—a one-time consultation or periodic check-ins, in-person or virtually. Just make sure you understand how and how much your advisor is paid. Costs matter. 4. Have a financial plan To really get on top of your finances, you may want to work with a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ (CFP®) professional to develop a comprehensive financial plan. A recent study published in the Journal of Financial Planning found that households working with a financial planner made better overall financial decisions. I'm a huge advocate of a comprehensive financial plan because it goes beyond saving and investing and helps you look holistically at all the interrelated parts of your financial life. It reviews your income, expenses, investments, retirement planning, insurance needs, income taxes, estate planning needs, and—most importantly—how they all work together within the context of your goals. Plus it gives you a roadmap to follow and a plan of action. It starts with you Financial independence isn't just about how much money you have. It's also about having the confidence to make your own decisions. Female or male, single or married, we all need to be in control of our financial lives. But women especially need to take greater charge. By doing so, we can each be part of the drive for a gender equal world—for ourselves and for future generations. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I\\'m 59 and recently suffered a severe injury that prevents me from working, possibly for several years. How do I qualify for Social Security disability benefits? —A Reader Dear Reader, I wish there was a quick and easy answer to your question, but unfortunately there\\'s nothing quick and easy about Social Security disability benefits (SSDI). There are a lot of rules and regulations regarding these benefits, and it\\'s tough to qualify for them. In fact, most applications are denied. For instance, according to SSA statistics over the past several years, an average of 64 percent of disability claims were denied. I don\\'t mean to sound discouraging, just realistic. Because while it appears that you do meet a couple of the qualifications—you\\'re under your full retirement age and you have a medical condition that is expected to last at least one year—the application and screening process is generally arduous and slow. I can walk you through the basics so you\\'ll have some information to draw on as you start the process. Basic SSDI qualifications As I said, there are very specific regulations around disability benefits, and qualifications are strict. To qualify: You must be younger than your full retirement age (FRA). You need to have accrued enough Social Security work credits to pass two earnings tests: the \"recent-work test\" and the \"duration-of-work test.\" The credit requirement is a sliding scale, based on your age (fewer years the younger you are). At age 60 you must have had Social Security-covered employment for five out of the last ten years. You also must have worked at Social Security-covered employment for a total of at least 9½ years. Your medical condition must be so severe that you are incapable of working and it will last for at least one year or until death. You can\\'t earn more than a minimal amount of money ($1,350 per month in 2022; $2,260 per month if you\\'re blind). However, there\\'s no limit on the amount of assets or unearned income you have or how much income your spouse has. There are certain medical conditions that automatically define you as disabled. The SSA maintains a list that you can get at www.socialsecurity.gov/disability. If your condition is on this list, the application process may be a bit faster. It\\'s worth checking into. How benefits are determined If you qualify, your benefit is based on your average lifetime earnings. Generally you\\'ll receive the same amount that you would receive from Social Security at your FRA. The average SSDI monthly benefit is $1,282 (as of 2021). It\\'s important to realize that once you reach your FRA, SSDI benefits are automatically switched to your Social Security retirement benefit. You don\\'t receive both. Also be aware that your benefit may be reduced in certain circumstances, for instance if you receive other state or federal benefits such as worker\\'s compensation. As a side note, you get automatic Medicare coverage after you\\'ve received SSDI benefits for two years, regardless of your age. Family benefits On the bright side, your family members may also be able to collect benefits based on your disability once you qualify—up to 50 percent of your basic benefit subject to a \"family maximum\" of between 150 and 180 percent of your benefit. These family members include: Your spouse age 62 or older provided you were married at least one year. Your spouse at any age if he or she is caring for your child who is age 16 or younger, or disabled. Your unmarried children under age 18. Your children under age 19 if full-time students (through high school), or disabled. Severely disabled children over age 18. Similar to spouses, ex-spouses also can collect if age 62 or older as long as you were married at least 10 years, or at any age if caring for your child who is 16 or younger, or disabled. The application process You\\'ll have to compile a library of information about yourself, your work history, and your medical condition, and complete numerous forms. The more thorough and accurate you are from the start, the more likely you are to speed up the process. It can be extremely helpful to work with a disability attorney to help you navigate the process, but make sure you understand any fees, costs, and services upfront. If your claim is approved, your first check will cover the sixth full month after your disability began, with payment starting the next month (for the month prior). If your claim isn\\'t approved, you can appeal the decision—but you generally have to do so within sixty days. A bit of good news here is that you may have a better chance of being approved on appeal than you had on the first go-round. The SSA states that an application for disability benefits can take three to five months, so if you believe you qualify, don\\'t delay. You can apply online at www.socialsecurity.gov/disability or by calling 1-800-772-1213. You can also contact your local Social Security office. Best of luck! Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': \"How much income do you need to replace in retirement? There are guidelines—and then there's reality.\",\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I\\'ve heard that generally speaking you can get by on 70-80 percent of your annual income in retirement. Is that really a reliable estimate? —A Reader Dear Reader, A lot of people would certainly sleep better knowing they had enough money to live comfortably in retirement. That\\'s why we have approximations like the 70-80 percent guideline. They give people an estimate to work towards, which is a step in the right direction. But a guideline is one thing—and reality can be another. So your question gets right to the heart of the matter: How much of your annual income do you really need to live comfortably in retirement? If only the answer were as simple as the question. Guidelines are static While I\\'m all for giving people a starting point, one limitation of guidelines is that they assume that life is a constant. Which is far from reality. For starters, in this instance are we talking about 70-80 percent of your income needs at age 40 when you might be raising a family, saving for college and carrying a large mortgage? Or your income just before retirement, when your financial obligations are most likely very different? Should it be based on your peak earning years? And are we talking about gross income in a single year or net income? (Generally, it\\'s considered gross income, not your take-home pay.) Plus, the result of using a single year\\'s income as a basis might be that you end up with less money than you need for the standard of living you envision in retirement—or conversely it might have you struggling to save more than you\\'ll actually need. Retirement is dynamic Another assumption is that retirement expenses will be constant. That, too, isn\\'t accurate. While certain essential costs of living may remain the same—and some costs may go down, such as work expenses, taxes, and mortgage payments—the way retirees choose to spend time during different phases of retirement may require more or less income. For instance, you may have heard the concept of the \"go-go,\" \"slow-go,\" and \"no-go\" years. Often retirees spend more in their early retirement years on things like travel and entertainment, and may need 100 percent or more of income to live the lifestyle they want. The middle retirement years may be focused closer to home, with more nights in than dinners out, and expenses may go down. Costs in the later years of retirement can often be a function of health and longevity, with medical and long-term care costs warranting a larger percentage of income. Retirement spending isn\\'t a straight line. Research has shown that while some retirees need more than 80 percent of their previous income throughout retirement, others can get by with closer to 50 percent. And those percentages can fluctuate within the course of a retirement. It\\'s very individual. Your situation is unique General guidelines can’t factor in things like your risk tolerance, size of your family, or your lifestyle. These are unique to you. So bottom line, to understand how much you will need to have a comfortable retirement, you have to get specific. Start by doing a sample budget. You might divide it into three categories: needs, wants and wishes. Needs are the things you can\\'t do without like housing, everyday living, health care, insurance and taxes. Wants are the nice-to-haves like travel and nights out. Wishes are where you can let yourself go—include all the things you\\'d do if you had unlimited time and money. Now it\\'s up to you to decide what\\'s realistic. With your lists in front of you, add up your sources of reliable retirement income: Social Security, a pension, or income from an annuity. Your savings will have to make up any difference between the total of your income and your spending. The percentage of income you need to replace in retirement to cover your projected expenses is also a function of how much discretionary income you have. If money is tight and you use most of your income to cover essentials, chances are you\\'ll have to replace a larger percentage of that income in retirement just to get by. If, on the other hand, you\\'ve had the good fortune to have a fair amount of discretionary income, you may have more latitude in deciding how you might cut back in retirement and consequently replace a lower percentage. Boost your confidence with a personalized plan To get back to your question, I think it\\'s okay to use the 70-80 percent guideline if you\\'re pretty far from retirement and only looking for an approximation. Using a higher percent guideline is better if you’re more conservative. Either way, the closer you get to retirement the more specific you need to be. To me, the key to confidence is to plan ahead. Recent research by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) found that only 42 percent of people had actually tried to calculate how much they\\'ll need to save to live comfortably in retirement. And that\\'s where the uncertainty comes in. On the positive side, Schwab’s 2019 Modern Wealth Survey found that 56 percent of people who were planners felt “very confident” they would reach their financial goals compared to only 17 percent of non-planners. So to really understand how much retirement income you\\'ll need, dig into the details. Plug some numbers into a retirement planning calculator. Consider talking to a financial planner who can help you with how much you can spend, discuss how inflation and taxes come into the picture, and put together some \"what if\" scenarios based on your personal situation. In the meantime, pay off your consumer debt, consider reducing fixed costs like a mortgage, and even experiment with living below your means. That way you\\'ll not only be able to save more now while you have your full income, you\\'ll get used to living on less. That may be the ultimate way to personally understand what percentage of your income will be enough to live comfortably and confidently through all the phases of your retirement.

       "   'abstract': \"Funding a grandchild's education can be complicated business. Be sure to consider all of your choices before making a decision.\",\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I\\'d like to set up an educational fund for my new grandchild. I understand the tax benefits of a 529 account, but am also interested in gifting appreciated stock. What are your thoughts? –A Reader Dear Reader, Congratulations on your new grandchild! I also applaud your generosity. What a fortunate child to have such a supportive family. You\\'re also wise to weigh your options. A gift of appreciated stock can be a great way to fund education. On the other hand, as you mention, a 529 account has several advantages, but a 529 only accepts cash, not stock or other assets. As is so often the case, the devil is in the details. Regardless of whether it\\'s you or your grandchild who ultimately sells the appreciated stock, that person may be hit with a tax bill that can include not only federal capital gains tax, but potentially also net investment income tax and state taxes. New rules under the 2020 SECURE Act repealed the changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that had made gifting appreciated stock to a minor problematic. (Under the 2017 law, assets owned or sold under a child or grandchild’s name were often hit with tax rates faster and higher than assets sold by a parent or grandparent. This is no longer the case.) As a grandparent you have a few ways to gift the stock You can gift the stock in-kind and have it sold under the grandchild’s name. Under this strategy, the child may pay less in taxes than the grandparent, thus increasing the size of the gift. You can sell the stock and gift the after-tax proceeds to your grandchild. This can make sense if you pay lower taxes on the sale than your grandchild would. Alternatively, you can make a gift of the stock to your grandchild at your death. This takes advantage of a \"step-up\" in basis, which means paying no taxes on any previous appreciation on the stock. In this way you may be able to make an even larger gift, but the downside is you won\\'t be around to see it. A big part of your decision will be based on the difference in the total tax burden for you versus your grandchild in selling the stock. In addition, you\\'ll want to weigh the pros and cons of placing college funds in a custodial account versus a 529. Let’s take a closer look. A few tax basics for the grandparent When anyone sells stock in a taxable account, they may have to pay capital gains taxes on any appreciation from the sale. Whoever owns the stock is also subject to income taxes from dividends paid out when holding the investment. The capital gains tax rate is based on how long the stock has been held. Appreciation on stock held for one year or less is taxed at ordinary income tax rates where the highest federal tax rate is 37 percent. On the other hand, long term capital gains (LTCG) rates that vary from 0-20 percent apply if the investment is held for more than one year. Fortunately, when you gift property, your grandchild assumes your holding period. So, your grandchild doesn\\'t need to wait another 12 months to sell the stock to be eligible for LTCG rates. Note that single individuals with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) more than $200,000 and married filers with MAGI more than $250,000 will also owe an additional Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)—sometimes called the Medicare surtax—of 3.8 percent on top of LTCGs. While the current (2021) federal top marginal tax rate on LTCGs is a combined 23.8 percent, taxpayers also have to pay state and local income taxes on their capital gains income. The state tax rate can vary from 0 percent in states like Florida and Nevada that don\\'t levy an individual income tax to as high as 13.3 percent in California. So where you and your grandchild live may be another variable to consider. Don\\'t forget that gift taxes may apply if the amount you are gifting is over $15,000 (2021). It is unlikely that taxes would be due, but check with your tax preparer about whether you should file a gift tax return. Lastly, ask your tax and financial advisor about other taxes that could come into the picture when selling stock; for example, increased taxes on Social Security or Medicare. What you need to know about the new “Kiddie Tax” laws The Kiddie Tax is a special tax rule for minors who have unearned income, such as interest or dividends paid by an investment. One of the main goals of gifting appreciated stock to grandchild or child is to \"shift\" the taxable income of that asset from a higher tax rate (yours) to a lower tax rate (your grandchild\\'s). You could pay less in taxes to Uncle Sam, and your child would get a bigger gift. A win-win. Under the SECURE Act, the first $1,100 of a minor child\\'s investment income (interest, dividends, and other unearned income) is not taxed. The second $1,100 is taxed at the child\\'s tax rate. After that (a total of $2,200), additional income is taxed at the parent’s marginal tax rate (this is the Kiddie Tax). A child is generally considered a minor for Kiddie Tax purposes if he or she is under 18 or a full-time student under age 24 at the end of the tax year. With a custodial account, your gift might not be used for education If you decide to gift your grandchild the stock (as opposed to cash), you\\'ll likely place it in a custodial account. Using a Uniform Gift to Minor\\'s Account (UGMA) or Uniform Trust to Minor\\'s Account (UTMA) gives you control over the assets, but only until the age of majority (usually 18-21 depending on the state). At that point, though, you have to understand that your grandchild has full rights to spend the money any way he or she wishes. In other words, your grandchild might decide to use the money for a car, not college, and you have to be comfortable with that possibility. Also keep in mind that assets held under the child\\'s name, including UGMAs/UTMAs, are looked at less favorably than 529 assets if applying for financial aid. Is a 529 plan a good option? Now let’s look at a 529 plan. I\\'ve written about 529 plans extensively in the past, and I believe they provide a great tax-advantaged way to fund an education. In fact, they are the most popular education savings plan for savvy families for good reason. But as I mentioned above, 529 plans can only accept cash. Still, the proceeds of the stock sale could ultimately be used to fund a 529. A grandparent- or parent-owned 529 has lots of pros, including the following: Provides for more control over the gift to ensure that it\\'s is used for education Can be more advantageous if applying for need-based financial aid in the future May be eligible for a state tax deduction Offers tax-free growth on qualified distributions That said, remember that 529 accounts are specifically designed for education costs. Under the SECURE Act, up to $10,000 can now be used to repay qualified student loans (for the beneficiary or any siblings). Be aware that some states may consider this a non-qualified distribution and may reclaim state tax benefits you received. Check with your tax advisor. If you want your grandchild to be able to use the funds for something other than an education, a 529 account may not be the best choice. Withdrawals from a 529 that are considered \"non-qualified\" are subject to ordinary income taxes and a 10 percent penalty. Your gift can combine the best of both approaches Rather than an \"either/or\" decision, you could open both a 529 plan and a custodial account, possibly funding different accounts in different years. In the future, a UGMA/UTMA could be used to cover expenses for your grandchild (like clothes, a car, summer camp or flights home from school) not covered by the 529. Gifting as part of an inheritance could allow for a bigger gift Taking a completely different tact, you should understand that a gift of appreciated stock at your death results in a \"step-up\" in the cost basis, potentially greatly reducing the tax liability. This can be a good option, especially for older grandparents closer to the end of their retirement who might be able to make a larger gift of the appreciated stock as part of their estate. Next steps As you can see, finding the best way to fund a grandchild\\'s education can be complicated business. There are lots of moving parts so it\\'s important to consider all your options before making a decision. Most of us will do well to work out the specifics with a tax advisor and financial planner. These experts can help you refine strategies such as the timing of the gift and tactically combining a 529 plan with a custodial account.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I’m an unmarried, 100 percent disabled veteran. My VA disability compensation is my only source of “income.” Are there any tax-advantaged investment vehicles (besides IRAs) for me to grow my (already) tax-free disability benefits? I have very limited income but I’d still like to invest for my future. What’s the best way for a disabled veteran to build wealth and break the cycle of poverty when we can’t take advantage of IRAs or 401(k)s? —A Reader Dear Reader, I’m forever thankful and in awe of the tremendous sacrifice that you and so many other veterans have made for this country to protect our many freedoms. Thank you for your service. Unfortunately, as you point out, your lack of “earned income” does indeed eliminate certain options like a 401(k). In a similar vein, I often hear from retired readers who are also frustrated because they want to continue to save and invest. Being a disabled veteran further complicates this issue. However, there are still options available to help you build wealth. Let’s first take a look at some tax-advantaged choices and then turn to taxable options. All can be effective ways for you to invest for your future. What counts as earned income? Under IRS rules, \"earned income\" consists of taxable wages, salaries, tips or some other form of paycheck. While long-term disability payments before 65 can be considered earned income, VA disability payments, military or other private pensions, and Social Security are not considered earned income. Neither are interest and dividends from investments, unemployment benefits or child support. Additionally, under the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, alimony received by someone divorced or separated after December 31, 2018 is no longer considered earned income. This means that none of these sources of income can be used to contribute to an IRA, 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b). While that may be disappointing, you can still save and invest. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) HSAs are one of my favorite tax-advantaged investing options and I’ve written about them in earlier columns. Contributions are 100 percent tax-deductible, your savings grow tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free if used for qualified health expenses. To contribute to an HSA, you must have a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), and you can\\'t be enrolled in Medicare. Veterans with an HDHP may still be able to contribute to an HSA if they receive hospital care or medical services administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs for a service-connected disability. 529 Achieve a Better Life (ABLE) Accounts/529A These tax-advantaged accounts are a form of special needs trust for individuals disabled before age 26 (you can open one later if you were disabled before age 26). ABLE accounts allow individuals and families to contribute up t0 $15,000 (2021) a year with a lifetime total contribution of $100,000 without impacting certain means-tested federal/state aid benefits like Supplemental Social Security (SSI), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Medicaid. Contributions are not federally tax-deductible, but distributions of investment earnings are federally tax-free if used for qualified disability expenses. These qualified expenses are written pretty broadly and may include education, housing, transportation, employment training and support, personal support services, health care expenses, and other expenses that help improve health, independence, and/or quality of life for the designated disabled beneficiary. ABLE accounts were designed from 529 College Savings Accounts and are sometimes also called 529A accounts. There are about 40 states that offer them and each has its own cost structure, investment options, and rules. You can open an ABLE account in any state that accepts outside residents into their program. (By the way, you don’t need earned income to contribute to 529 College Savings Plans either.) ABLE contributions may also be eligible for the Saver’s Credit, which is a type of tax credit that can reduce your tax bill. You can learn more about ABLE accounts at ABLE NRC. After-tax annuities Another tax-deferred option for those without earned income, these are also referred to as non-qualified deferred annuities. Key benefits include no contribution limits and no required distributions. That said, withdrawals of earnings prior to age 59½ are subject to ordinary income rates and an additional 10 percent early withdrawal penalty. In their purest form, annuities are designed to provide guaranteed income. They can be a good solution for some individuals seeking retirement income; however, they can be complex and have higher costs than other investment options. Be sure to work with a trusted professional before you proceed. Another option—spousal IRAs You say you\\'re unmarried now, but I want to mention spousal IRAs because they\\'re one of the most overlooked opportunities for married couples to save for retirement. Spouses without earned income can still contribute to an IRA if they are a joint filer with a worker who does have earned income. Brokerage accounts The main investing option is a regular brokerage account, which allows you to invest in everything from mutual funds, to ETFs, to individual stocks and bonds. A brokerage account isn\\'t tax-sheltered so you’re subject to taxes on the interest and dividends you receive and on gains from the sale of investments. You can lower the tax bite by using tax managed or low turnover exchange traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds. A powerful benefit of taxable accounts is that if an asset is held for more than one year, any gain on its sale may qualify for the long-term capital gain rate of 0-20 percent, as compared to 10-37 percent ordinary income rates that apply to IRAs, annuities or 401(k) withdrawals. There are no limits to how much you can save, and you can make penalty-free withdrawals at any time. As I always remind readers, do your research before you invest and be mindful of your risk tolerance and time horizon. You can always save and invest As I hope you can now see, there are potentially many effective ways for you to invest if you don’t have earned income. As a disabled veteran, you’ll want to be extra careful about any earnings or savings strategies that may impact any means-tested benefits you may be receiving. Contact an attorney and work with the VA for more assistance. That said, I encourage you to take full advantage of both tax-deferred and taxable accounts. If you continue to save and invest over time, you will be well on your way to a financially secure future. Best of luck, and once again, thank you for your service. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'There are generous exclusions for capital gains on the sale of a home—but timing is crucial.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, Two and a half years ago my husband and I moved from a home we had owned and lived in for ten years. At that time we bought a new house and have been renting out the old one. Will we have to pay capital gains if we sell the old house? —A Reader Dear Reader, Great question—and good you\\'re asking it now. That\\'s because, while there are generous exclusions allowed when it comes to capital gains on the sale of a home, timing is crucial and the clock is ticking. Under current laws, if you sell your principal home and make a profit, you can exclude $250,000 of that profit from your taxable income. And that\\'s just the exclusion for an individual. Married couples can exclude up to $500,000 (if both spouses each meet the ownership and use tests below). So, depending on how much of a profit you make on the sale, you and your husband could potentially have no capital gains tax bill at all. I say \\'potentially\\' because in order to claim the maximum exclusion, you have to pass what the IRS calls the ownership and use tests. This means: You have to have owned the house for two years. You have to have lived in the house as your principal residence for two out of the last five years, ending on the date of the sale. There are a few exceptions to these rules—for example, if you had to move before owning the home for two years because of a job change or because you experienced what the IRS designates as an \"unforeseen circumstance,\" such as a divorce or natural disaster. In these situations the IRS will allow you to prorate the exclusion. And interestingly, the two years residency doesn\\'t have to be consecutive—you just have to have lived in your home for a total of 24 months out of the five years prior to the sale. It sounds like you easily pass the ownership test. However, since you\\'ve been out of your prior home for two and a half years, you have only six months left to meet the residency requirement. So there\\'s no time to lose. Here\\'s what I suggest to help you determine your potential taxes and maximize your exclusion. Calculate your cost basis To determine capital gains on the sale of your home, you simply subtract your cost basis from the selling price. But what exactly is your cost basis? It\\'s not just the purchase price. It also includes certain settlement fees, closing costs and commissions associated with both the purchase and the sale (excluding escrow amounts related to taxes and insurance, etc.—see IRS Publication 523 for more information). Add to this the cost of significant capital improvements (but not repairs) you made over time for renovations, additions, roofing, landscaping, and other upgrades. All of these improvements will increase your cost basis, and therefore lower your potential tax liability. Hopefully, you’ve kept good records because this can add up! On the other side of the equation, there are a few things that can reduce your cost basis. A lower basis will increase your profit, and potentially your tax. For example, if you have a home office and have claimed depreciation over time, you now have to subtract those deductions from your cost basis. Or if you received tax credits for energy-related improvements, you have to subtract that amount as well. Estimate sale price and capital gains Now estimate your sale price and subtract your cost basis. Let\\'s say you bought your house for $350,000, put in $50,000 in improvements and had related fees and costs of another $15,000, giving you a cost basis of $415,000. Now let\\'s say you expect to sell the house for $850,000. Your potential capital gain would be $435,000. Factor in exclusion In the above example, if you met both the ownership and use tests, you and your husband could exclude the entire gain from your taxable income. You wouldn\\'t even have to report the sale on your tax return. However, let\\'s say your capital gain turned out to be $525,000. In that case, you\\'d have to report the sale and pay long-term capital gains on $25,000. Act fast! In your situation, with only six months left to meet the residency requirement, I\\'d get your home on the market as soon as possible. The five-year residency period is from the date of purchase to the date of sale. On the bright side, if you successfully sell your old home within the time limit and take the exclusion, you can take it again should you decide to sell your current home—as long as the two sales are more than two years apart. Good luck with your sale. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com. Carrie cannot respond to questions directly, but your topic may be considered for a future article.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I just looked at my health insurance bill and the monthly premiums are almost as much as my car payment! I’m 23 and in good health. The one time I did need to see the doctor, I still got stuck with a $700 bill! It seems like paying for health insurance is just a waste of my money. Do I really need it? —A Reader Dear Reader, I’m empathetic to your plight and I’m worried about young people and many families who are thinking of skipping health insurance due to the costs. I understand that it can be frustrating if you\\'re faced with big out-of-pocket expenses even if you have coverage. But going without health insurance can be catastrophically expensive. So yes, you 100 percent need health insurance. That said, there are some strategies that can reduce your costs—without sacrificing quality or coverage. Let’s take a look. How health insurance can save you money Health insurance helps you save money by enabling you to transfer a big financial risk to the insurer in exchange for a (comparatively) small premium. I’m not saying that health insurance isn’t expensive. Health insurance costs have been rising faster than overall inflation and worker earnings for years. I’m just saying that not having health insurance can be financially devastating. For example, imagine how expensive it would be to cover the costs of staying in the hospital or paying for a trip to the emergency room. You could easily rack up a bill in the thousands, potentially costing all of your savings—or more! Options and strategies to help lower your costs Like clothing, there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to health insurance. Choices abound, so it’s important to think carefully about your own needs and the needs of your family before you decide. Once you have insurance, make sure to review your coverage annually or if you have a major life change like getting married or moving to a new community. Understanding health insurance isn’t easy, so don’t hesitate to ask for help from your employer, an advisor, or someone you trust. Coverage options for young people Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), young people are now able to stay under a parent’s plan if it covers dependents until the age of 26. This can be the case even if you’re married, not living with your parents, or have left school. Check with your parent’s plan about specific enrollment periods. Students still in college may be able to find health insurance through a student health plan. This can be an affordable option, but be sure to check to see if the coverage counts as \"qualifying coverage\". Otherwise, there might be more limited benefits or certain exclusions. That being said, a student plan might be a backup option if you can’t be covered through a parent’s plan. What about short-term, limited duration (STLD) plans? I’m not a big fan of short-term plans and am worried that some people will choose these plans based on lower premiums alone, without understanding what they\\'re buying. These plans generally last up to a year and are cheaper than traditional plans, but this is partly because these plans have more limited coverage and reduced consumer protections than plans that qualify under ACA standards. This means these plans often exclude coverage for things like pregnancy and mental health and you can be turned down for pre-existing conditions like asthma or cancer. These plans can make sense in some situations and “some” insurance is better than none, but if you’re tempted by this type of plan make sure you understand what is—and isn’t—covered. Coverage options for workers About half of Americans have health coverage through work. This type of coverage is often subsidized by the employer to help reduce the costs to employees. You may have more than one option with different premiums, co-pays, and deductibles as well as access to a different network of health professionals, so take the time to determine the best fit. Make sure to consider health insurance when you\\'re changing jobs and during your employer’s enrollment period when you can make changes. High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)/Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) HDHPs offer lower monthly premiums, but have higher deductibles. An HDHP/HSA combo can be a great choice for people who don’t use medical services a lot and can help you save money by allowing you to pay for out-of-pocket health costs tax-free. The mistake that I often see people enrolled in HDHPs make is neglecting to use the cost savings from the lower premiums to fund an HSA. If you sign up for an HDHP, make sure you 1) Open up an HSA. 2) Fund it every month. 3) Put your savings to work by investing your savings when possible. Coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace exchanges If you don’t have coverage through work, you can find health insurance at one of the federal or state exchanges at healthcare.gov. Premium Tax Credits (PTCs) may help lower your monthly premiums. Or you may be eligible for coverage through expanded Medicaid programs in some states if your income is low enough. Keep in mind that special enrollment windows and conditions apply so you have to plan in advance of signing up. Health care Navigators offer unbiased, free help over the phone and in-person guidance and can help you shop for and enroll in affordable coverage. Coverage if you’re self-employed or a small business owner If you’re part of the growing \"gig\" economy, working as a contractor, your own boss, or you own a small business, make sure to check out options available through healthcare.gov. You may also be eligible for a tax break by deducting the cost of health insurance as a business expense to help lower your costs. Check with a tax advisor for details. Health insurance helps secure your financial future For many young adults like yourself, paying for your own health insurance coverage is something new and may seem like it’s not important. But the opposite is actually the case. Having good health insurance is one of the most crucial pieces to your financial plan. It’s vital to your financial health by helping protect you from financial calamity. In fact, having the right kind and the right amount of health insurance is one of the smartest money moves you can make. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I’m turning 30 and know that I need to get serious about saving. How much should I be setting aside? —A Reader Dear Reader, Thank you for this question. The future can seem so far away, and the path to that future so unsure, that it can be difficult to know exactly how much to save… or even to find the motivation to get started. The reality, though, is that the earlier we start to save—whether it’s for retirement or other goals—the less difficult the challenge becomes. Let’s start with retirement A comfortable, secure retirement is the biggest financial challenge most of us will ever face, so it’s smart to put it at the top of your priorities. The following guidelines are not absolute, but they can give you a reasonable estimate of what it takes to prepare for retirement. As you can see, the earlier you start, the smaller the bite: If you\\'re getting started in your 20s, save 10-15 percent of your pre-tax income. If you’re getting started in your 30s, save 15-20 percent of your pre-tax income. If you\\'re starting to save in your early 40s, save 25-35 percent of your pre-tax income—a pretty meaningful chunk of your income. If you start later, the percentages add up quickly. So save as much as possible, and consider other strategies, such as retiring later, to manage retirement. The real beauty of these guidelines (especially for those who are young) is that the percentages won\\'t change as you get older. If you\\'re 30 and can save 15-20 percent of your income for retirement, you probably won\\'t need to save more than 15-20 percent as you age. Starting early is a huge advantage, provided that you remain consistent throughout your working life. Don’t get me wrong. I understand that saving 15 percent of your pre-tax income when you\\'re 25, or 20 percent of your income when you’re 30, is tough—especially when you’re trying to pay off student loans or manage other financial obligations. But the numbers don\\'t lie—retirement is a hugely expensive challenge, and the earlier you start preparing for it, the better. Also realize that you can choose to lessen the hit to your current income by contributing to a tax-deductible account such as a traditional 401(k) or an IRA. Alternatively, you can channel your savings into a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA, paving the way for future tax savings. And then move on to your other goals Once your retirement savings are on track, it’s time to broaden your sights: Emergency fund: Make sure you have enough cash set aside to cover three to six months’ worth of nondiscretionary expenses. Keep this money in a savings or other liquid account. You won’t earn a lot of interest, but you will be increasing your financial security. A child\\'s education: If you have kids, I recommend considering a 529 plan to shelter investment gains and income from taxes. The amount you need to save will depend on your income and the type of college (public or private) you envision. The down payment on a house: A more near-term goal for many people is buying a home. Given today’s real estate market, this is not an easy task. To get the best mortgage rates, aim to save a minimum of 20 percent of the purchase price. Other goals: If you have other goals (for example, travel or starting a business), put those on the list as well. Determine the amount you want to save by a particular date, and back out the math. Put your savings on automatic Once you’ve determined your savings goals, I highly recommend that you arrange an automatic transfer to your savings or investment accounts each month; that way, you won\\'t have to consciously make the \"save or spend\" decision each month. A payroll deduction plan is ideal for retirement, especially if it goes into a tax-advantaged plan like a 401(k) or an IRA account. (Your 401(k) plan contributions are often matched to some degree by your employer—making your effective savings rate even higher.) Invest according to your time frame Finally, understand that \"saving\" is different than investing. You can’t afford to take risks when you’re saving for a short-term goal. But when you’re striving to meet a goal that is at least five years in the future, it’s prudent to consider tapping the potential of the financial markets (particularly the equity markets) to give your savings the chance to grow into wealth.

When is the best time to file for Social Security benefits? This straightforward question is among the hardest to answer. In fact, the entire Social Security system, which is intended to be fair and accessible, is mind-numbingly complex. The unfortunate result is that many retirees lose out on valuable benefits, generally because they choose to start to collect too early. The Basics You are eligible to start collecting Social Security retirement benefits at age 62. However, by claiming as soon as you can, your benefits are permanently reduced. But if you wait until what the Social Security Administration calls your full retirement age (FRA), which is 66 for those born between 1943 and 1954, you’ll get a larger monthly benefit based on your work history, known as your primary insurance amount (PIA). If you were born after 1954 your FRA is somewhere between ages 66 and 67. But keep in mind that the term “full retirement age” can be misleading. In general, your benefits will continue to increase until age 70 if you continue to wait to start your benefits. After you reach your FRA, assuming you continue to wait, your monthly benefit will continue to increase until you reach age 70— at which time you max out. The rationale is clear: You can get a smaller payment for a longer amount of time or a larger payment for a shorter amount of time. In theory these two balance out over time, at least when looking at data for millions of people. But when you’re thinking about what’s best for one person or one couple, the averages don’t apply. Once you understand how the system works, you are in a position to make the best decision for your own situation. What the Numbers Tell Us A comprehensive 2012 study by economists John Shoven of Stanford University and Sita Slavov of Occidental College identifies the conditions when it is most advantageous to delay Social Security benefits. They conclude that gains from delaying are greatest: When interest rates are low For married couples relative to singles For single women relative to single men For two-earner couples relative to one-earner couples For a married couple, deferring the primary earner’s benefit as compared to deferring the secondary earner’s benefit. Think About Your Life Expectancy According to the Social Security Administration, the typical 65-year-old today will live to around age 84, one in four will live to age 90, and one in ten will live to 95. Women have a slightly higher life expectancy than men, and the odds are even better that one person in a married couple will outlive the averages. Then consider that for a person born between 1943 and 1954, delaying the start date from age 62 to age 66 increases benefits by roughly 33 percent. Delaying to age 70 results in an increase of 76 percent. But keep in mind that these figures don’t assume inflation increases. A break-even analysis shows you how long you have to live to increase your overall benefit. For example, let’s say that you’re entitled to a $1,000 monthly benefit at age 66. If you start collecting benefits at age 62, your monthly draw will be reduced to $750. If you hold off until age 70, your monthly benefit will increase to $1,320. Take a look at the following chart. Lifetime Social Security benefit Lifetime Social Security Benefit Begin Age 62Monthly Benefit $750 Begin Age 66Monthly Benefit $1,000 Begin Age 70Monthly Benefit $1,320 Live to Age 70 $72,000 $48,000 $0 Live to Age 75 $117,000 $108,000 $79,200 Live to Age 78 $144,000 $144,000 $126,720 Live to Age 80 $162,000 $168,000 $158,400 Live to Age 83 $189,000 $204,000 $205,920 Live to Age 85 $207,000 $228,000 $237,600 Live to Age 90 $252,000 $288,000 $316,800 Live to Age 95 $297,000 $348,000 $396,100 As these numbers show, if our 62-year-old lives beyond age 78, she will collect more by postponing the start of benefits to age 66. If she lives to age 83, which is the national average, she will collect the most by postponing her start to age 70. Of course you can’t predict how long you will live. But if you’re healthy and longevity runs in your family, most likely you’ll increase your lifetime benefit by postponing your start date. But according to the Social Security Administration, most eligible workers file for benefits before their FRA, with around 45% claiming at 62. So before you file for Social Security benefits, be sure to calculate your benefits over your anticipated life span. Think about the current interest rate environment Think About the Current Interest Rate Environment Every year that you delay collecting Social Security between the ages of 62 and 70, your monthly benefit will increase between about 6 and 8 percent. If you were born between 1943 and 1954, and your FRA is 66, the numbers look like this: Delay Annual Benefit Increase Age 62-63 6.66% Age 63-64 8.38% Age 64-65 7.60% Age 65-66 7.20% Age 66-67 8% Age 67-68 8% Age 68-69 8% Beyond Age 70 None Now compare these rates against the return you could get from a very low risk investment like U.S. Treasuries or an insured savings account. Clearly, the lower the prevailing interest rates, the more you stand to benefit over the long run by delaying Social Security. This is particularly true when you think about what economists call “real” interest rates, or the rate you earn after inflation. As an example, let’s say you’re 64 and trying to decide whether to tap into your 401(k) savings or collect Social Security. If part of your 401(k) is invested in Treasuries, in 2020 you’re effectively earning no interest after inflation. You’ll get a better return by withdrawing those funds and allowing your Social Security benefit to grow. Or let’s say that you’re considering buying a commercial annuity that will pay you for life. By instead choosing to delay Social Security, you are in effect buying an inflation- adjusted annuity from the U.S. government. The primary difference is that you most likely get a better rate. The lower the prevailing interest rates, the better the deal. However, when the economy recovers and interest rates rise, this may not be the case. Shoven and Slavov conclude that delaying Social Security is most advantageous when real interest rates are 3.5 percent or lower. Think About Your Income from Other Sources If you don’t have enough savings and are dependent on Social Security income to pay for necessities, you may have no choice but to collect Social Security as soon as you can. But if you have savings or income from other sources, and can afford to postpone your start date, you will likely benefit by delaying. Also realize that if you file for Social Security benefits before your FRA but you continue to work, and your earnings exceed certain limits, part of your benefit will be temporarily withheld. In 2022, if you file for benefits at age 62, $1 in benefits will be withheld for every $2 you earn above $19,560. In the year you reach your FRA, $1 is deducted for every $3 you earn above a higher limit, currently $51,960. Once you reach your FRA there is no earnings deduction, and you will get the money previously withheld in the form of a higher benefit. If You’re Married, Compute Your Combined Benefit This is where Social Security gets really tricky. As an individual, you try to maximize your lifetime benefit. But as a couple, your goal is to maximize your combined benefit over both of your lifetimes as well as survivor benefits. This involves analyzing your personal benefits as well as the potential to take advantage of spousal benefits. Basic Rules for Spouses As a spouse, at age 62 you can choose to take a benefit based on your own earnings or a spousal benefit based on your spouse’s earnings. The only caveat is that to receive the spousal benefit, your spouse must have already filed. The spousal benefit is up to 50 percent of the earner’s FRA benefit. The actual percentage depends on when you file; if you wait until your FRA, you collect a higher benefit. For example, if a husband files early at age 62, his benefit would be reduced by 25-30 percent. If his wife waited until FRA to file for a spousal benefit, she would collect 50 percent of his FRA benefit. However, if the wife decided to take spousal benefits at age 62, her benefit would be reduced even more to 35 percent of his FRA benefit. The impact on survivor benefits is similar. At FRA a widow or widower can collect up to 100 percent of their spouse’s benefit (or a reduced benefit starting at age 60). When someone opts to collect benefits early, his or her surviving spouse will also collect a reduced benefit. Conversely, when a person decides to delay benefits, he or she is providing their survivor with a larger benefit. It’s important to note that once a person dies, the survivor gets to keep the higher of their own or the deceased’s benefits. He/she doesn’t get to keep both amounts. If you are divorced but were married for at least ten years and are currently unmarried, you can still collect a benefit based on your ex’s record. Unfortunately, unmarried couples don’t have spousal rights under Social Security. Social Security Strategies for Spouses Working as a team, spouses have some choices that can significantly boost their combined benefit. A warning, though: These types of strategies can get very complex, and their effectiveness depends on a number of variables, including the difference in ages and earnings records between the two spouses. With the first strategy, sometimes called the “62/70 split,” the lower earning spouse takes Social Security as early as age 62 and the higher earning spouse postpones filing until age 70 to maximize his or her benefit. With this scenario, the couple receives some Social Security income now (albeit at a reduced rate) and a higher survivor benefit later. Alternatively, the higher earner could file for benefits at 70 and the lower-earning spouse could claim at their FRA. This strategy, allows the lower earner to collect a higher benefit compared to claiming at 62, while the higher earner’s benefits continue to grow. The couple could also claim at FRA/FRA or 70/70 depending on their objectives and when they need the income. The only way to determine if any of these strategies will work for your family is by crunching the numbers. So if you’re married and want to maximize your joint Social Security benefits, I highly recommend that you consult with a financial advisor who has in-depth knowledge of the Social Security system. Think About Your Tax Situation What Uncle Sam gives, he also takes away in the form of taxes. Regardless of when you retire, up to 50–85 percent of your Social Security income may be taxable if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) reaches certain levels. Be aware that different sources of income from pensions, required minimum distributions, or investment income, for example, can impact the taxability of Social Security income. Qualified distributions from a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), for example, do not, but Traditional IRA and 401(k) distributions do. Bottom line? The most common error people make when it comes to Social Security is starting to collect their benefit too early. Yes, it’s tempting to take the money and run. But before you do, carefully weigh your options. On further scrutiny, you are likely to find that you will get the best return on your money by postponing and allowing your monthly benefit to increase. Social Security Claiming Considerations Consider taking benefits early if: Consider taking benefits later if: Consider taking benefits early if: You're not working and can't make ends meet. > Consider taking benefits later if: You're still working and make enough to impact the taxability of your benefits. > Consider taking benefits early if: You are in poor health. > Consider taking benefits later if: You are in good health and longevity runs in your family. > Consider taking benefits early if: You are the lower-earning spouse and your spouse can wait to file for a higher benefit. > Consider taking benefits later if: You are the higher-earning spouse and want to ensure that your surviving spouse receives the highest possible benefit. > Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': \"Are you completely honest with your partner about your finances? Here's why you should be.\",\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, I recently heard an interesting story about a man who expressed his love for his wife in an unusual way. It wasn\\'t with an extravagant gift or a surprise trip to a tropical island. No, he wrote her a book—a book about their financial life. While that might not be what you\\'d choose to give or receive as a Valentine\\'s Day gift, to me it made sense. And not because I\\'m unromantic. Quite the contrary. I think it was a wonderful gift for the very reason that sharing the details of your financial life is actually very intimate, revealing and requires absolute trust. In this case, the husband was worried because his wife wasn\\'t at all interested in being involved in their finances. What would she do if something happened to him? Who could she turn to? To me, his book was actually a very practical love letter. This fellow\\'s solution may be quite out of the ordinary, but partners not sharing their financial lives is unfortunately common for a variety of reasons—some harmless, others downright dangerous. Here are just a few potential problems that I think every couple should be aware of, plus some practical, mostly loving solutions. Why couples don\\'t talk about money Lack of interest—Like the wife of the fellow above, some people just don\\'t care to be involved in the family finances. You might view this as an expression of total trust in the other partner\\'s ability to be on top of things. I can understand that. But as a financial planner, I don\\'t accept it. That\\'s because, no matter how capable one partner may be, there\\'s no guarantee that they\\'ll always be around. I\\'m not suggesting a breakup necessarily, but life—and death—can get in the way. Financial habit—For some couples, it\\'s not so much a lack of interest, but rather a matter of habit. This is especially true for women. You might think that women who leave money management up to their spouses is a 1950s stereotype, but according to a recent report from UBS Global Wealth Management, more than half of women today still defer to their male partners when it comes to money. And, surprisingly, the stats are even greater for younger women: 56 percent for those age 20-34 versus 54 percent for women over 51. It may be a habit that we\\'ve unconsciously passed from generation to generation, but it\\'s one that needs to be broken. False assumptions—As a financial planner, I often hear people say they just assumed their spouse was doing something, whether it\\'s paying off debt, saving for retirement or maintaining life insurance. It\\'s only in a time of crisis that they find out they were mistaken. Another common assumption is that their spouse will outlive them. None of these things should be taken for granted Financial infidelity—When one partner is hiding money details from the other—things like significant credit card balances, major purchases, large debts or even secret savings accounts—there can be a serious issue. I\\'m a big advocate for every relationship to include some financial autonomy (a \\'yours, mine, and ours\\' system of checking accounts and credit cards), so what I\\'m talking about here is different. According to a 2018 Harris Poll conducted for the National Endowment for Financial Education, 41 percent of American adults admit to financially deceiving their partners. The reasons range from protecting privacy to embarrassment to fear of disapproval. Hiding major purchases can derail the trust between you and your partner. Open communication is key to any successful partnership. Abusive control—As I wrote in a recent column on financial literacy and social justice, financial abuse is a prevalent part of domestic abuse and comes in many forms ranging from forbidding someone to work, to controlling all of the money, to running up large debts on joint accounts, to outright theft. This isn\\'t just a serious breach of trust, it\\'s a potentially dangerous situation for the victim both financially and emotionally. Why every couple should start the conversation now So what\\'s the solution? Essentially, as simple as it sounds, it comes down to open and honest communication. You can\\'t coerce a disinterested partner into taking action but you can share information. You can counter assumptions and break financial habits by asking questions, talking about common goals and mutually deciding to share some financial responsibilities. If you\\'ve been financially deceptive, it won\\'t be easy, but once you\\'ve put all the details on the table, you can go deeper into the \"whys\" behind your actions. Financial abuse is a much more serious problem that may take some outside help. But if you\\'re a victim, it\\'s important that you make someone else aware of your situation. Every couple\\'s financial relationship is different, and while you and your partner don\\'t have to be equally involved in your finances, you do need to be equally aware and respectful of each other\\'s needs and perspective. You don\\'t have to write a book, but you could do something as simple as taking time quarterly to catch up on your financial picture, what might have changed and where all the important documents are. Whether or not each of you is actively involved in financial decision-making, you should both know the big picture—things like net worth, cash flow, debt, insurance, investment accounts, retirement savings and estate planning. And if one of you has more knowledge than the other, share it. Financial literacy may not be sexy, but it can actually make for a better relationship. To me, staying in sync about your money is a crucial part of keeping your romance alive. Happy Valentine\\'s Day! Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': \"Dear Carrie, I've always been a good saver, and now at 29 with a steady job, I have a fairly sizable savings account. My friends are getting into investing, but it seems like such a risk and makes me uncomfortable. Isn't it enough to just keep saving? —A Reader Dear Reader, Being a good saver certainly puts you ahead of the game. And having a solid savings account is an important step toward financial security. So first, congratulations on that. But is saving enough? For some things, yes; for other things, no. Because while saving is about accumulating money, investing is about growing your money. And that can make a huge difference in your financial future. But let's take a step back and talk a bit more about the what and why of each. Saving sets the stage Basically, saving is putting aside money for future use. You can think of it as money you have left over once you've covered your essential expenses. Or, ideally, you can make saving a line item on your monthly budget, so that saving itself is one of your essentials. But however you look at it, having that money tucked away will help you pay for the things you want above and beyond your daily expenses, and also cover you in case of emergency. And that's all good. Having a sizeable savings account can help you stay out of debt and give you the cushion you need should you face an unexpected illness, job loss or expense. Plus, when you want something special like a week's vacation, you've got the money. But here's the catch. Most people keep their savings in a bank account. The upside is that it's easily accessible and safe; the downside is that it won’t earn very much. Money in savings accounts is not likely to keep pace with inflation. Which means the money you have saved today can actually lose buying power over time. That's why just saving isn’t enough. Investing creates the action Investing, on the other hand, is about putting your money to work for you with the goal of growing it over time. Here's an example. If you put $3,000 each year in a savings account and earn 1 percent, at the end of 20 years you'd have about $67,000. If you invested that same amount of money and got an average 6 percent return over the same time period, you'd have nearly $117,000. The sooner you start saving the less you may need to save because your money gets to work that much sooner. The more you save, the more you have to invest—and the more those returns can add up. Of course, as you say, investing involves risk. And the stock market particularly will have its ups and downs. But there are ways to mitigate that risk. The key is to choose a broad range of investments in stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance and time horizon and never put all your money in one particular stock. One other important factor is time. To protect yourself against market downturns, a long-term approach is essential. At your age, you have time to keep your money in the market and ride out the inevitable market lows. The trick is to stick with it through those lows, keeping your focus on the potential for long-term gains. Each plays an important role in your financial life Saving and investing aren't mutually exclusive. How they work together depends on your goals and when you think you'll need the money. Are you saving for a vacation or the down payment on a home? Money for those types of shorter-term goals is best kept out of the stock market. Retirement savings? That's another story. Here's a possible saving/investing scenario: Keep enough cash to cover 3-6 months essential expenses in an easily accessible savings account, money market account, or short-term CDs (certificates of deposit). If you think you'll need your money within the next five years, avoid investing in the stock market. Stick with cash and bond mutual funds and ETFs (exchange-traded funds). Include broad-based stock mutual funds or ETFs when you know you won't need the money for at least five to seven years. This is especially relevant for retirement savings. Get started investing—now You've got the savings covered, but don't stop there. I understand how investing can be a bit daunting, so take it step by step. If you have a 401(k), that's a great place to start. Talk to friends and family. There’s lots of online information available and many financial companies offer no-cost, automated assistance that can help you build a portfolio that reflects your personal goals and timeframe. Learn as much as you can, ask questions and don't be afraid to seek professional advice. I feel excited for you. At your age and with your savings habit firmly established, you have a great opportunity to really focus on building your future. It's your moment—grab it. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'Close to retirement? Here are some age-related dates and deadlines to put on your calendar.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, I\\'m turning 60 next year and keep hearing about different age-related requirements and milestones. For example: FRA? RMD? And when can I start withdrawing money from my 401(k) without a penalty? I want to make sure I don\\'t miss something important. Can you help? —A Reader Dear Reader, Although a lot of us may try to forget our age as the years go by, when it comes to reaping the financial rewards of getting older, you\\'re wise to keep certain age-related milestones top of mind. But as might be expected for the rules and regulations surrounding retirement withdrawals and government benefits, it can get complicated. Therefore, it\\'s important to understand what you need to do—and when—to help assure you don\\'t make a costly mistake and that you get all the economic benefits you\\'re entitled to. Here\\'s a checklist of basic ages to keep in mind and the significance of each. AGE 55: If you have assets in an employer-sponsored qualified retirement plan such as a 401(k) and leave your job (called separation of service) on or after the year you turn 55, you can take a distribution without paying the 10 percent penalty for early withdrawal. You will, however, pay income taxes on the money. AGE 59 ½: At this age, you can take distributions from your qualified retirement plan or traditional IRA without penalty. Once again, you will pay income taxes on the earnings or any contributions that were tax deductible. If you have a Roth IRA and have held it for five years, you can withdraw these earnings both penalty- and tax-free. AGE 62: This is the earliest date you can begin taking Social Security benefits (unless you are disabled). But realize that if you do, your payout will be permanently reduced by approximately 25-30 percent. (And if you\\'re still working and earn beyond a certain limit, benefits are further reduced on a temporary basis.) So before you decide to take Social Security at this age, consider how much more you could make over time by waiting. AGE 65: At 65 you\\'re eligible for Medicare—a very significant milestone considering the high cost of health insurance and medical care. If you\\'re already receiving Social Security, you\\'re automatically enrolled in Parts A and B. If not, you can apply for both Social Security and Medicare at the same time. However, if you prefer to delay Social Security, you can apply for Medicare alone—ideally, three months before the month you turn 65. You can enroll for Medicare online, in person or by phone. (Note: You can choose to delay Part B coverage if you are covered by an employer plan.) Also note that once you are on Medicare you are no longer able to make contributions to a Health Savings Account. AGES 66-67: This is when you reach what the Social Security Administration calls your \"full retirement age,\" or the time that you can begin receiving \"full\" benefits. For anyone born in 1943 or later, FRA ranges from 66-67 depending on the year you were born. It\\'s important to note, however, that if you delay receiving Social Security beyond your FRA, your benefits will continue to increase until you reach age 70. When you\\'re ready to apply, there\\'s an online application at SSA.gov. AGE 70: As mentioned above, Social Security benefits don\\'t increase beyond this age. So if you haven\\'t already, file for your benefits now. AGE 70 1/2: If you were 70 1/2 by the end of 2019 you\\'re required to begin taking money from tax-advantaged retirement plans such as a traditional IRA, 401(k), Roth 401(k), 403(b), SEP, SIMPLE or 457 plan. The minimum you must withdraw—your Required Minimum Distribution or RMD—is determined by a formula based on life expectancy and the amount you have in tax-advantaged accounts. As of 2019, the deadline for taking your first RMD was April 1st of the following year you turned 70 1/2. If you turned 70 1/2 in 2019 and chose to delay your RMD until this year, remember that you’re still on the hook for an RMD for 2020. You don\\'t have to take an RMD from retirement plans like a 401(k) or 403(b) if you\\'re still working, and never from a Roth IRA. AGE 72: Under the new SECURE Act, if you turn 70 1/2 on or after January 1, 2020, you are subject to RMDs beginning at age 72. Just like under the old rules, you have until April 1st of the following year to take the first RMD. Keep in mind that you\\'re still on the hook for an RMD for the current year. Thereafter, you have until the end of the calendar year to satisfy your RMD withdrawals. Your tax professional can help you determine your RMD and make sure you’re compliant with IRS RMD rules. It\\'s definitely worth double checking. Failure to withdraw what you are supposed to can lead to a hefty 50 percent penalty! So it\\'s really important to pay attention to RMD deadlines. Being mindful of age-related dates and deadlines is only part of the picture. You also need to sit down and review your own financial picture—retirement accounts, Social Security benefits, other sources of income—and create a retirement budget and withdrawal strategy. It\\'s not only about missing something; it\\'s about taking every opportunity to secure your financial future. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'abstract': 'Facing retirement together? Beware of these lifestyle issues that can affect your finances—and your relationship.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Readers, I often write about the financial conversations couples should have before they decide to spend their lives together. To me, getting to know each other financially is an important part of any relationship. But what about after you\\'ve been together for a number of years and are close to retirement? You may think at this point that you\\'ve worked through any money issues. In fact, you may take certain financial things for granted. But retirement is a whole new phase of life. Are you ready to face this together? Even if you\\'ve been saving diligently and feel like you have a handle on savings, retirement can bring up fundamental lifestyle issues that can have a profound effect on your finances as well as your relationship. So I believe it\\'s as important now to have a frank and soul-searching conversation with your partner about your goals and financial attitudes as it was before you started out together. 10 Questions Every Couple Should Ask Before Retiring 1) Should we retire at the same time? This can be a tricky question because you have to look not only at your financial readiness to retire, but also your emotional and physical readiness. Your relative ages, individual health and feelings about your work all come into play. For instance, for one of you, retirement may be an escape from the daily grind; for the other, it may be a loss of identity. There\\'s no rule that says you have to retire together. The timing depends on what\\'s best for each of you individually as well as the two of you as a couple. 2) Will we find a new place to live? There\\'s a lot to explore here. Downsizing or moving to a less costly location can make economic sense, but what about proximity to friends and family? Or having room when the grandkids visit? The idea of moving to a retirement community can also be a particularly emotional flashpoint. Put it all on the table and acknowledge that there\\'s more to consider here than dollars. 3) How will we spend our time? What retirement looks like can be very different for each of you. One of you may envision a trip around the world, while the other can\\'t wait to jump into a new business venture. To avoid conflicts down the road, make sure you\\'re on the same path before you set out. 4) How much \"togetherness\" do we want? Speaking of time, a common issue for retirees is the amount of time they want to spend together… or alone. Talk this out, considering how each of you would choose to spend personal time, for instance volunteering, classes or sports. And speaking of personal space, that can apply to time at home as well. If you respect each other\\'s desire for time alone, you\\'ll enjoy your time together even more. 5) How will we handle household finances and personal money? If you\\'ve been together a while, chances are you already have a method for handling everyday expenses. I always favor a \"yours, mine and ours\" approach, so that each partner has a certain amount of independence. Retirement shouldn\\'t change that. The real challenge for many retirees is to go from saving to spending what you\\'ve already accumulated. So now\\'s the time to revisit your budget and income sources to make sure you\\'ll have enough to cover essentials. Once retired, you should strive to keep at least one to two years\\' living expenses in an easily accessible account. 6) Should we be out of debt completely? Being debt-free before you retire can be a great goal. For many, though, it\\'s not realistic, or even desirable. By all means, strive to pay off high-interest consumer debt like credit cards and car loans. And make a pact to charge only what you can afford to pay off each month going forward. But your mortgage is another consideration. Because interest on a mortgage may be a very low rate and tax deductible, it could actually work in your favor. However, if you believe that being mortgage free would give you greater peace of mind, paying it off before you retire may be the best choice for you. 7) When should we take Social Security? While this is an individual decision, couples should carefully consider how it might affect their overall benefits—short-term, long-term and survivors. Generally speaking, the longer you wait (up to age 70) to collect benefits, the higher your payout. But there are couples strategies that can increase your benefits depending on your ages and incomes. For instance, a lower earner might take benefits early and the higher earner wait until age 70. The spousal benefit is also a factor for nonworking or lower-earning spouses. To get a basic idea of your alternatives, run some numbers on a Social Security calculator and talk to your financial advisor. 8) Should we revise our investment portfolio? Generally speaking, it\\'s smart to reduce investment risk in retirement. But that doesn\\'t mean you have to do it all at once. Here\\'s a possible timeline: Just as examples, pre-retirement, you might strive for a moderate approach of 60 percent stocks, 35 percent fixed income and 5 percent cash. Early in retirement, you might shift those percentages to 40/50/10. Late retirement, you could shift them again to 20/50/30. Because your retirement can last several decades, it\\'s important to consider some exposure to stocks to help combat against inflation. Of course, how you invest should match not only your personal wealth but also your feelings about risk, and you and your partner may have different styles of investing in your retirement accounts. That\\'s fine. But if you\\'re working as a team, be sure to discuss your differences and coordinate for long-term security. 9) What about health issues? This is the great unknown and a potential financial drain. All you can do is be prepared. If you have a health savings account (HSA), continue to fund it for future use (once you file for Social Security you are no longer eligible to contribute to an HSA.) When you do retire, make sure you have a good Medigap or Medicare Advantage policy. Medicare.gov is a good source of information. Also think about long-term care insurance. And finally, agree on basic estate planning, and be sure you both have advance healthcare directives. 10) Will we still be able to help the kids/grandkids financially? While all of these questions are emotional as well as financial, this may be the hardest. We all want to help our kids—and it\\'s great if we can—but when it comes to retirement, you have to put your needs first. Talk to your family about what they can or can\\'t expect from you once you\\'re retired. And don\\'t feel guilty. Your family will ultimately be better off if they don\\'t have to worry about your financial security. Chances are you\\'ve spent a lot of time and energy saving for retirement. Now that you\\'re almost there, talking about these important issues will hopefully give you and your partner more time, energy, and resources to enjoy it! Have a personal finance question?

       "   'content': 'Editors\\' Note: This article is excerpted from The Charles Schwab Guide to Finances After Fifty, available in bookstores nationwide. Read more at http://schwab.com/book. Most of us have come to fear estate taxes. But at least for now, federal estate taxes are an issue for the very wealthy only—or for those with an estate valued at more than $12.06 million (or $24.12 million for a married couple) in 2022. But before you crack open the champagne, a couple of caveats: First, we can never say never when it comes to Congress. The current tax rates are scheduled to \"sunset\" at the end of 2025 where they will revert back to 2017 levels (adjusted for inflation) under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). However, anything can happen in the future. Second, even though you may not have to pay federal estate taxes, you may be on the hook for state taxes. That said, the best you can do is plan with the information you have. Below I cover basics as well as strategies for anyone whose estate may still be impacted. But you should be aware that estate taxation—or just about anything having to do with estate planning— is complex. It’s always best to work with an experienced estate planning attorney. THE FEDERAL ESTATE TAX SYSTEM: BASIC STRUCTURE The federal estate tax is actually part of a larger system of taxation called the federal transfer tax system, made up of: The estate tax, which covers transfers of property at death. The gift tax, which covers transfers of property during a person’s lifetime. The generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax, which covers transfers of property to people who are one or more generations younger. The estate and gift tax work hand in hand. Without the gift tax, individuals could give away all of their assets during their lifetime and avoid taxation. Without the estate tax, individuals could give away all of their assets at death without taxation. Therefore, estate and gift taxes are joined together into what is sometimes referred to as the federal unified transfer tax system. Both create an identical tax liability. Estate and gift taxes share other characteristics as well: They use the same tax rate schedule. They share a credit (the applicable [or unified] credit amount) that reduces or eliminates a person’s tax liability. This credit allows for an applicable exclusion, a dollar amount that will not be taxed. Computation of both the estate and the gift tax is cumulative over one’s lifetime. A gift tax credit used in one year reduces the amount of gift tax credit that can be used in future years. The total gift tax credit used during one’s life reduces the credit available to use against his or her estate taxes. Both have marital and charitable deductions to reduce tax liability. The GST tax, which has a flat rate, is separate from the unified tax system and is imposed in addition to estate and gift taxes. The purpose of the GST tax is to prevent families from avoiding one round of estate tax by transferring assets to grandchildren instead of to children. The government adds the GST tax to the regular estate tax (yes, this is double taxation). In 2010, the estate, gift, and GST tax exclusions were all set at $5 million, indexed for inflation. In 2017 the TCJA temporarily increased the exception from $5.5 million. The exemption is $12.06 in 2022 for unmarried persons and $24.12 million for married couples. The tax rate above that exclusion is 40 percent. What\\'s Your Estate Worth? An estate tax calculation starts with your gross estate. The basic principle for valuing property is generally its fair market value, or \"the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller... both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.\" The date of valuation is either the date of death or six months later (whichever date is chosen, it applies to all property). (Note: Real estate used in a closely held business or farming operation may be valued with a “special use” method.) Sometimes the fair market value of an asset is clear-cut, but often it is not. For example, valuing a closely held family business, an interest in a limited partnership, or even a thinly traded stock can be nuanced and may require the services of a professional appraiser. The basic rule is that a federal estate tax return is due if the gross estate exceeds the applicable exclusion amount in the year of death ($12.06 million in 2022). Often it’s obvious that a particular estate will or won’t fall above this level, particularly with the exemption set so high. However, many other estates require close scrutiny. WHAT’S INCLUDED IN AN ESTATE? In a word, everything. Many assets are straightforward: for example, your investment accounts, bank accounts, residence, other real estate, equity in a business, cash value in an insurance policy, and personal property. However, other assets are a bit more obscure. For example, the following are also included in your estate: A life insurance policy that you own on the life of another person A life insurance policy on your own life if you own the policy or if you have an incident of ownership (the ability to exercise an economic right) A life insurance policy on your own life if you transferred ownership within the three years preceding your death Property held in joint tenancy Any property over which you have a power of appointment (the ability to name who will enjoy or own the property) The present value of a pension, retirement benefit, or annuity if there are survivorship benefits Any property in which you have a retained life interest (the ability to use the property under specified terms), even if you transferred the property to someone else prior to your death Any property that you revocably transferred prior to your death (you had maintained the right to take it back) To value your estate, first add up your assets and subtract your debts. Then subtract the value of any assets that will be transferred to a charity on your death. If you’re married, you can also deduct the assets that will go to your spouse, provided he or she is a U.S. citizen (and therefore avoid estate tax until he or she dies). SMART MOVE: You can avoid estate taxation of life insurance proceeds by creating an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT). The irrevocable trust is the owner and beneficiary of the policy. If there are no incidents of ownership retained by you, the proceeds are kept outside the estate. However, the trust must purchase the policy or the original owner must live at least three years after transferring an existing policy into the trust. Married Couples Get a Break It wasn’t very long ago that married couples had to set up bypass trusts (also known as AB trusts or credit shelter trusts) to take advantage of each other’s estate tax exclusions. This has changed because of portability, a relatively new provision that allows a surviving spouse to add any unused portion of a deceased spouse’s exclusion to her or his own exclusion. In other words, in 2022 a married couple can pass on up to $24.12 million to their heirs free from federal estate tax without a trust or any extra planning. The following example illustrates how portability works. WITHOUT PORTABILITY: Husband and wife Braverman have two equal shares of an estate valued at $23.16 million. When Mr. Braverman dies, he leaves his entire $12.06 million to Mrs. Braverman. No estate tax is due because of the unlimited marital deduction. Mrs. Braverman’s estate is now worth $24.12 million. When she later dies, the first $12.06 million can pass to her heirs free of estate tax. However, her estate must pay tax on anything above $12.06 million, at a rate of 40 percent. WITH PORTABILITY: Under current law, the Bravermans can take advantage of each other’s exclusion. When Mr. Braverman dies, his executor can elect to transfer his unused $12.06 million exclusion to his wife. Like before, Mrs. Braverman’s estate is valued at $12.06 million, but she now also has a $12.06 million exclusion from taxes. She can pass on the entire estate free of tax. With portability, the couple no longer has to use the decedent’s spouse “unused” exclusion amount. In other words, before portability it was a “use-it-or-lose-it” proposition. Portability extends the time to both spouse’s exclusion until the survivor dies. CAUTION: Portability is not automatic. The executor must file an estate tax return even if no tax is due in order for the surviving spouse to take advantage of the deceased spouse’s exemption. Note, though, that in our example we do not address potential appreciation. With traditional estate planning, the amount excluded from the first-to-die’s estate would be put into a bypass trust for the benefit of the surviving spouse. The assets in this trust, regardless of their value and any future appreciation, would then remain outside the surviving spouse’s estate for tax purposes. The trust could appreciate to any amount and still would be free of estate tax when the surviving spouse dies. Portability doesn’t allow for unlimited appreciation in this way. If you expect large growth and the potential to go over the exclusion, you might consider a bypass trust. DIFFERENT RULES FOR A NONCITIZEN SPOUSE The federal government doesn’t want someone who isn’t a U.S. citizen to inherit a large amount of money, pay no estate or gift tax, and then return to his or her native country. Therefore, if your spouse isn’t a U.S. citizen, you may not be able to transfer your assets to him or her tax-free. Nonetheless, you can leave assets worth up to the exclusion ($12.06 million for deaths in 2022) to anyone, including your noncitizen spouse, without owing any federal estate tax. If the noncitizen spouse dies first, assets left to the spouse who is a U.S. citizen do qualify for the unlimited marital deduction. If your estate exceeds this limit, you can also set up a qualified domestic trust (QDOT), which can postpone payment of estate taxes until after your noncitizen spouse dies. CAUTION: As great as portability is for reducing or eliminating taxes, it does nothing to control how or when your heirs will receive assets. As a result, you may still want to discuss the benefits of a particular type of trust with your attorney. For example, in a second marriage a qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) trust can provide for the surviving spouse as well as for the children from a first marriage. Strategies to Reduce Your Taxable Estate Even with the generous exclusion, some estates may be subject to tax. You may want to discuss the following with your estate planner: Gifting: Lifetime gifting has many advantages, not the least of which is the pleasure you can derive by seeing your beneficiaries enjoy your gift. In 2022 you can gift up to 16,000 to an unlimited number of people in a single year ($32,000 for a married couple “splitting gifts”) without triggering any tax. Not only do you remove the value of the gift from your estate, but you also transfer future appreciation to the beneficiary. This is one of the best ways to reduce your taxable estate at the same time that you help others. CAUTION: The value of property gifted within the last three years of life may be included in your estate if it has “strings attached.” For example, if you gifted a second home to a relative but retained the right to use it as you please, the fair market value of the property could revert to your estate. STEP UP Before you gift highly appreciated property, also think about the potential capital gains tax for the beneficiary. If you transfer the property while you are alive, you also transfer your cost basis. But if you instead bequeath the property at your death, the asset’s cost basis will “step up” to the fair market value on the date of death. Let’s take a look at some numbers: Let’s say you give your daughter $10,000 worth of stock that you purchased ten years ago for $2,000. If she sells the stock immediately, she will owe capital gains tax on the $8,000 profit. If your daughter instead receives the stock at your death when it is worth $10,000, she will have no tax for income tax purposes. Her tax basis would be $10,000—not $2,000. Making unlimited direct payments to qualified medical and educational institutions: Any payments that you send directly to an IRS qualified physician, hospital, or school or college on behalf of someone else aren’t counted in your annual gift tax exclusion. In other words, you can pay for your grandchild’s college education plus give them a gift of up to $16,000 a year without reducing your lifetime exclusion. Charitable giving: Bequests to a charity are fully deductible from estate taxes. One strategy is to transfer assets from your estate to a charitable lead trust (CLT). The charitable organization will receive an annuity for a set number of years, and at the end of the term your heirs will receive the remainder. You can also do the opposite with a charitable remainder trust (CRT). In this case, the trust will pay income for a period of time to beneficiaries you name. At the end of the stated period, the remaining trust assets pass to your charitable organization(s) of choice. You get a deduction for the portion of the value of the trust that is for the charity. Qualified personal residence trust (QPRT): You can transfer your home into a trust, thereby removing a portion of its value from your taxable estate. You retain the right to live in the house for a certain number of years, and at the end of that term the home is transferred to your beneficiary. You can then arrange to stay in the home and pay fair market rent. The longer the term, the smaller the gift for tax purposes. Once your home is placed in a QPRT, future appreciation accrues outside your estate. But beware that a QPRT will help avoid estate taxes only if you outlive its term of years. If you do not survive the QPRT term, the value of the residence is included in your estate. Does Your State Have an Estate or an Inheritance Tax? Most people focus on federal estate taxes. However, depending on where you live, you may also be liable for significant state taxes, which can take the form of either an estate or an inheritance tax (or in a couple of cases, both). STATE ESTATE VS. INHERITANCE TAX Estate taxes are based on the value of the deceased person’s estate no matter who receives it. Inheritance taxes vary depending not only on the amount being transferred but also on the relationship between the deceased and the beneficiary. In most states, the closer the relationship, the lower the rate. A spouse will pay the least, a minor child will pay more, an adult child or parent will pay more still, and a brother or sister will pay even more. Nonrelatives will pay the most. If you live in a state with an estate or an inheritance tax, you’ll need to do some extra planning. In most states the exclusion is well below the federal level of $12.06 million–plus. Also note that none of the states that have an independent estate tax have made the exclusion portable between spouses—so for some families a bypass trust could make sense. A Word on the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax If you’re fortunate enough to have a large estate, and your children are also well-off, you may want to consider making gifts to your grandchildren, great-grandchildren, or unrelated people who are more than 37 ½ years your junior (yes, that’s the way the rules are written). Like other gifts, these will reduce your taxable estate. However, if the gifts don’t qualify for the $16,000 annual gift limit ($32,000 for a couple splitting gifts), they will be charged against your lifetime GST exclusion ($12.06 million in 2022) in addition to your lifetime gift tax exclusion. Any amounts over that will be taxed at 40 percent. TALK TO AN EXPERT: No matter how you look at it, planning for an estate that is larger than the estate tax exclusion—or any complex estate—takes the expertise of an estate planning attorney. Review the basics for your own knowledge, then consult with an attorney you know and trust. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, Today I’m departing from my usual format to share with you my greatest wish for the new year and the next decade: that as a nation we will come together to unleash the tremendous power of financial literacy. When asked about financial literacy, most people think of a classroom with lessons in budgeting, credit and debt, and perhaps even an introduction to investing. And they’re right—a financial literacy course can teach all of that. But there’s so much more. At its core, financial literacy is about extending equal opportunities to all, regardless of socioeconomic background. It's about breaking down the barriers between the haves and the have-nots. It's a powerful tool for social justice that can arm people of all economic backgrounds with the knowledge, skill, and training they need to thrive in an increasingly complicated and competitive world. Think, for example, about the student who grows up believing that college is off the table because it's too expensive. Or the young worker who's denied a job because of a poor credit report. Or the woman who's stuck in an abusive relationship because her husband controls the family money. These are just a few examples of the insidious ways in which a lack of financial literacy can undermine a person’s full potential. And by extension these examples also illustrate the opposite—the life-changing power that can come when an individual knows that they have the skills and knowledge they need to make the best decisions for themselves and their loved ones. Financial Literacy and College Access I was discouraged to hear from the organization Prosperity Now that a significant percentage of low-income families have decided that college is not a possibility by the time their child is only three years old. I can’t help but compare this child’s opportunities to those of the child from an affluent family who at the same age is being groomed for entrance into a prestigious preschool that will then act as a launching pad to an elite education. The doors of opportunity open up for one child, and slam shut for the other. The disparity is striking and unacceptable. According to a study by finaid.org, at least 1.7 million students fail to file the FAFSA financial aid form each year because they incorrectly believe themselves to be ineligible. Others get in over their heads with debt, not understanding the size or timeframe for the payments. And in the worst case of all, almost 4 million students a year drop out of school without graduating, saddled with debt without a degree. Financial Literacy and Workforce Readiness Did you know that a poor credit report can prevent you from getting a job, getting a promotion, or even keeping the job you currently have? In fact, more and more employers are using credit history in background checks, which can have an outsized effect on hiring practices and advancement. Under recent changes, the Department of Defense will now continuously monitor the financial status of service members with security clearances. Poor credit, carrying too much debt, uncorrected mistakes on a credit report, or bankruptcies, can jeopardize security clearances, ability to deploy, or promotions for those in the military. Financial Literacy and Domestic Abuse According to the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV), financial abuse occurs in 99 percent of domestic abuse cases. Think about it; for abusers, money is power. If you strip your partner of access to money, you also strip them of their ability to care for themselves or make decisions in their own best interests. The NNEDV also reports that victims find it difficult to leave an abusive relationship for the same reason. Because they have become dependent on the perpetrator, they can lack the resources, knowledge, and confidence to break the cycle. Financial abuse can be overt or subtle, taking many forms ranging from forbidding the victim to work, to controlling all of the money and paying the victim an “allowance,” to running up large debts on joint accounts, to outright theft. Certainly financial literacy isn’t a cure for such a potentially devastating and complicated array of crimes, but it does represent a powerful tool in self-protection, and a path to a better future. Common Threads Several threads connect these three examples. First, they all demonstrate that financial literacy can mean the difference between opportunity and adversity. A bright child who is denied an education, a qualified worker who is denied a job, or a person stuck in an abusive relationship simply won’t have as many choices available to improve their lives. Second, financial literacy means access, not necessarily to money, but to the vital information we all need to succeed in the modern world—whether that’s in school, or the workplace, or our private lives. A child who hasn’t been exposed to the basics of money management at home or in school is at a distinct disadvantage when they enter the real world of paying for college, getting a job, or leading an independent life. Third, the ultimate value of financial literacy is not just in knowing the mechanics of how to buy a car or buy a house, but in understanding how to approach a financial situation. I liken it to the value of a liberal arts education in that a financial education will teach you how to think, how to access a situation, put it into context, and weigh your options. It will help you adopt an analytical mindset regardless of the situation you face. Taken together, these benefits roll up to perhaps the most important advantage of all: having the confidence you will need throughout your life to establish priorities, set goals, and make smart financial and personal decisions that support those values. A Look to the Future As I survey the ever growing and maturing universe of financial education, I’m optimistic. I’ve personally been involved with financial literacy programs for over 20 years, and feel that we are at a tipping point. First, we’re making progress in our schools. North Carolina is now the 20th state to require financial literacy for high school students, also requiring teacher training. Powerful organizations including the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Foundation and The Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center (GFLEC), DonorsChoose, and the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy have all made major contributions to advancing financial literacy and reaching increasing numbers of people. I am particularly proud of our collaborative program Money Matters: Make It Count, offered through Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Since the program’s inception in 2004, over one million teens in over 1,300 clubs across the country have been introduced not only to basic financial concepts, but also to the practical realities of dealing with credit and debt and paying for college. Taken together, these and other innovative and effective programs in our schools, workplaces, and communities are adding up to a critical mass. After 20 years, I can finally say that as a nation we are coming to understand that an investment in financial literacy is an investment in each other and ourselves. As we face a new decade, we all deserve nothing less. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': \"Dear Readers, It's hard to believe we're already in 2022. But rather than lament the passing of time, I like to think of a new decade as a time of renewal—a chance to look at what you've accomplished and what you still want to achieve. Especially when it comes to financial security, the New Year is a perfect opportunity to review where you are and recommit to getting on top of your finances. Need a nudge to get going? Here are 10 steps that can help put you on the right track—and help you follow through all year long. 1. Take stock You can't make meaningful financial changes in the New Year unless you know where you are right now. A good place to start is with a snapshot of your overall wealth, otherwise known as your ‘net worth’. Add up your assets (what you own); then subtract your liabilities (what you owe). This will show you whether you're in the plus or the minus, and will help you plan and prioritize your spending, saving, and investing. It also provides a benchmark against which you can measure your progress over the years. Next, look at your cash flow over the past year. What came in each month? What went out? If you regularly spent more than you earned, decide what changes you'll make to turn things around. 2. Set goals and prioritize What's top on your list of goals this year? Whether you want to save more, pay off debt, start a college fund or help a family member, prioritize those goals so you have a clear idea of where to put your money first. Whatever your other goals, don't neglect regular contributions to your retirement accounts. 3. Spend mindfully Now create a budget that will support your new goals. Itemize monthly expenses, both essential and nonessential. Make sure any top priorities such as savings or debt reduction are line items on your list of essentials. When you make a spending decision, make it in the context of your goals. And if you spend beyond your budget, do it with a conscious understanding of how you're going to make adjustments to your future expenditures so you don't fall into more debt than you can handle. 4. Plan for the unexpected Make sure you have the right type and amount of insurance. Health insurance is a must, as well as automobile insurance if you have a car and homeowner's insurance if you own your home. Also consider life, disability and renters insurance, depending on your circumstances. Likewise, an umbrella policy if you have substantial assets. Build an emergency fund in an easily accessible account ideally with enough cash to cover three-to-six months' essential expenses in case of a job loss or illness. Don't touch this money except in an emergency. 5. Invest like a pro Review your portfolio at least quarterly and rebalance yearly to make sure you're still investing according to your goals and timeline. If you didn't do a 2021 year-end review, start 2022 by looking at your asset allocation and making whatever changes are necessary to keep your investments on track. Take advantage of online tools and quarterly reports that may be available from your broker. If your investments have grown beyond your own comfort level in managing them, consider seeking out a financial advisor. 6. Set up support systems Make day-to-day financial management easier by putting as much on automatic as possible. Use auto pay for recurring bills. Consider automatic deposits to savings and retirement accounts. And don't forget about personal support systems. If you need more reinforcement, consider setting up quarterly meetings with an advisor or other financial professional who can provide added insight and guidance. 7. Optimize your resources Use the New Year as a motivation to review employee or government benefits that may be available to you. Are you eligible for a pension from a former employer? Could you get better insurance coverage though a spouse’s plan? If you’re approaching retirement age, think carefully about the best time to file for Social Security. Do you have any amounts left over in your Health or Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA) that you need to use? FSAs can be great options to help you save money, but they have “use it or lose it” deadlines. It's also a good idea to periodically review the professionals you work with—your accountant, attorney, and financial advisor—to ensure they're still meeting your needs. 8. Create your legacy I think of my estate plan as a way to support the people and causes that I care about most. You may not need a complex plan, but at least create a simple will, especially if you need to appoint a guardian for minor children. Beyond that, think carefully about how you'd like your assets to be distributed and work with an attorney to prepare the appropriate documents. An advance health care directive is a necessity to protect both yourself and your loved ones. And be sure to review and update beneficiaries on retirement accounts and insurance policies. 9. Open up communications If you haven't regularly included your spouse or partner in financial decisions, now's the time. Share your priorities, budget, and documents as appropriate so that everyone in your family is onboard and willing to do their part. You might even set up regular financial meetings to keep everyone up to date and motivated. It's easier to change habits when everyone involved supports one another and is working toward the same purpose. 10. Stay involved Steps 1-9 can put you on the path to a more financially secure 2022, but to stay there, you have to remain involved. Stick to your budget, keep striving for your goals, talk to your family—and measure your success. Most importantly, make these steps the foundation of good financial management not only this year, but every year. Have a personal finance question? Email us at askcarrie@schwab.com.

       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, My girlfriend and I are both financially stable and each of us owns our own home. We\\'ve decided to move in together and are planning to live in her house. Can you give us some money management tips on how best to handle our finances at this point in our relationship? —A Reader Dear Reader, Moving in together is a big emotional step. It\\'s also potentially a big financial step—which can impact a relationship positively or negatively, depending on how open each partner is about money. In a situation like yours where you\\'re each financially independent, you may not be too concerned about who\\'s picking up the tab for dinner, but shared daily living expenses as well as bigger issues regarding things like mortgages, large purchases, vacations and future plans could cause problems. There\\'s no single recommended way to handle your finances. The details will vary for each couple. The most important thing is that you agree upfront on how to handle them. So before you take your togetherness to the next level, I\\'d make a date to talk through how financially close you each want to be. Start with the living arrangements Since you\\'ll be moving into your girlfriend\\'s house, and assuming she has a mortgage, the first question is how you\\'ll contribute to the monthly payment. Will you initially pay the equivalent of rent? If so, how will you determine what\\'s fair? The issue here is that, by paying rent, you\\'re contributing to the mortgage without having any ownership in the property. If you continue to live together long term, at what point would you want a share of ownership? And what percentage of ownership? It\\'s easy as time goes on to say \"our house,\" but for it to legally belong to both of you, the title needs to be in both of your names. Otherwise, you could quite literally be left out in the cold should the relationship end. On your side, what will you do with the house you own? Will you rent it? Sell it? If you sell, you could possibly invest some of the proceeds in your girlfriend\\'s house, therefore increasing your share of ownership in her home. There again, the title would have to be legally changed. (Note: If you decide to sell your house, think about completing the sale within the next three years. Otherwise, you will potentially forfeit your homeowner capital gains tax exclusion. Check with your tax advisor for details.) I\\'m not trying to make it more complicated than it needs to be, but there\\'s a lot to think about. A home is often an individual\\'s greatest asset, so it\\'s important for the two of you to agree on these things sooner rather than later. Discuss big-ticket items Living together often means investing in major purchases for your home from time to time—appliances, entertainment systems, furniture. Talk about how you\\'ll handle these potential costs. Will you share them equally? Each pay for different items? Again, there\\'s no right or wrong way to go about it. But it will make it a lot easier when the time comes if you have an idea in advance how you\\'ll handle these expenses. Likewise with things like entertainment and vacations. There\\'s no harm in treating one another, but make sure you have a mutual understanding about the things you want to do. Agree on a savings and cost-sharing plan so that neither of you always feels obligated to cover for the other. Drill down to the day-to-day Sharing a home also means sharing the ongoing costs such as utilities, cable, Internet, cleaning services, groceries—all the daily expenses that can add up quickly. Figure out how you\\'ll divide these costs. One approach is to come up with a monthly household budget, then each contribute an equal amount. If one of you earns more than the other, that person could offer to cover a greater percentage of the bills. Once again, the main point is to be fair. To make things easier for both of you, consider opening a joint account for everyday living expenses. That way, even if one of you is primarily responsible for handling the bills, you each have access to the account. A joint account would also allow you to comfortably put certain recurring bills on auto-pay. Keep an eye on the future In the early days of living together, it\\'s probably wisest to keep the majority of your finances separate. As your relationship continues or should you marry, you can decide how much you want to share. Some couples—especially those who join their lives when they\\'re already financially established—set up a ‘yours, mine, and ours’ system, allowing them to keep their accumulated assets separate while combining their incomes and sharing expenses. Down the road, I would also suggest that the two of you meet with a financial advisor. An objective and knowledgeable third party can help you understand your options and create a framework that is fair to both of you. I\\'m a firm believer in financial independence for everyone at every stage of life. But that doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t work together to achieve your dreams. At this point, take it a step at a time. Just be sure to discuss each step in advance so you know it’s fair to both of you—and that you\\'re both headed in the same direction. Have a personal finance question?

       "   'abstract': 'Giving a gift of stock is easy. But knowing the value for gift or income taxes can be a bit more complicated.',\n",
       "   'content': 'Dear Carrie, Am I right to assume that, for determining gift tax liability, the value of a gift of stock is the cost basis? —A Reader Dear Reader, I\\'m glad you asked this question because gifts of stock can raise a lot of tax issues. That\\'s because there are different ways of valuing stock depending on whether it\\'s for gift or income taxes. While your question is specifically about gift tax valuation, I\\'m going to expand my answer a bit. The potential for having a gift tax liability applies only to a donor who gives more than a certain amount ($16,000 in 2022) to any one person in a given year. The recipient of a gift doesn\\'t pay a gift tax, but when he or she decides to sell the stock, they have to calculate a value for income tax purposes. Valuing stock for gift tax purposes The simple answer to your question is no, the value of a gift of stock for gift tax liability is NOT the donor\\'s cost basis, but rather the fair market value of the stock at the time the gift is given. So let\\'s say you purchased 100 shares of XYZ stock at $50 a share. Your cost basis is $5,000. Now the stock is $80 a share and you give it as a gift. The value of your gift for gift tax purposes is $8,000. In 2022, you can give up to $16,000 to an unlimited number of individuals each year without paying a gift tax or even reporting the gifts. If you give over that amount to any individual, however, you must report the gift on your tax return, but you don\\'t have to pay taxes until you give away more than the current lifetime limit of $12.06 million—for the amount above and beyond $16,000 per person per year. So in the example above, there would be no gift tax liability. However, if the stock happened to be $200 a share, the value of the gift would be $20,000. You\\'d then have to report it and $4,000 would be applied toward your $12.06 million lifetime exemption. Valuing a gift of stock for income taxes The recipient doesn\\'t have to worry about gift taxes. It\\'s when the recipient decides to sell the stock that the issue of valuation comes up—for income taxes. And this is where things can get a bit more complicated. In general, when valuing a gift of stock for capital gains tax liability, it\\'s the donor\\'s cost basis and holding period that rules. As an example, let\\'s say you receive a gift of stock from your grandfather. He bought it for $10 a share and it\\'s worth $15 a share on the day you receive it. If you then sell the stock, whether for a gain or a loss, your cost basis will be the same as your grandfather\\'s: $10 per share. Sell it at $25 and you\\'ll pay tax (at the short- or long-term rate, depending on how long he owned the stock) on a gain of $15 a share; sell it at $8 and your capital loss will be $2 a share. But now let\\'s say the stock your grandfather bought for $10 a share was only $5 a share on the day you received it. If the stock continues to go down and you decide to sell it, the fair market value on the date you receive the stock and your holding period (which also begins on the date you received it) is used to determine your loss. So if you sell the stock for $3 a share, your capital loss will be $2 a share and your holding period will be measured from the transfer date. However, if the stock price rises above $10, then the original cost basis and original holding period transfers over to you. For example, if the stock in this case rose to $15, you would report a $5 gain and your holding period would be measured from when your grandfather first bought the stock. There is one important exception: if you sell the stock at a price somewhere between your grandfather\\'s $10 basis and the $5 fair market value, no gain or loss is recognized. Determining fair market value The concept of \"fair market value\" comes into play whether you\\'re looking at gift or capital gains tax liability, so it\\'s important to know how this is determined. Since stock prices can go up or down on any given day, the fair market value of a gift of stock is the average between the high and low share prices on the date the gift is given. As you can see, while the answer to your question is pretty straightforward, there\\'s a lot more to be aware of when it comes to gifts of stock. As always, it\\'s a good idea to talk to your tax advisor. And, one last point—try not to let IRS rules and regulations spoil the pleasure you can get from both giving and receiving!
