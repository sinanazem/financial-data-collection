       "  'content': 'As property developers run out of funding to finish properties, a growing number of buyers in China have stopped making mortgage payments on incomplete homes. The boycotts are a sign of the distress in Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s property market as the government seeks to rebalance the sector.  While the amount of mortgages that have been boycotted â\\x80\\x94 estimated at around 2% of outstanding mortgages â\\x80\\x94 is probably only a small portion of the homes that are at risk of not being completed, itâ\\x80\\x99s well within the Chinese governmentâ\\x80\\x99s capacity to make sure thereâ\\x80\\x99s funding to finish them, says Yi Wang, head of the Asia Pacific Real Estate team in Goldman Sachs Research. She estimates it would cost the government about 600 billion RMB ($98 billion) to completely eliminate the â\\x80\\x9ccompletion riskâ\\x80\\x9d for the next year.  That said, there are longer-term factors at work in the housing market, which has been an important source of economic expansion and investment for households. Urbanization and population growth, two key propellants for the property market, are slowing. Residential real estate is likely to undergo a multi-year downturn as the government pushes the sector to deleverage, according to Goldman Sachs Research.  We spoke with Wang about the mortgage boycotts and the megatrends that are driving Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s property market.  Why have some homebuyers in China boycotted their mortgage payments?  People have stopped paying mortgages out of fear that the developers are unable to complete the projects. Many of these projects have suspended construction for weeks or even months, and theyâ\\x80\\x99re realizing that the funding gap cannot be met anytime soon.  Typically, the buyers can terminate the pre-sale contract with developers if developers default on the completion date. Then buyers can terminate the contract and ask for the deposit down-payment back as well as all the mortgage payments that were already made.  But in this case, developers havenâ\\x80\\x99t officially defaulted yet. In many cases they have just suspended construction. However, with homebuyers learning of these funding gaps, some may be worried that they may not be able to get 100% of their money back from developers if default occurs, and therefore are taking action earlier.  What percentage of mortgages are estimated to be in boycott?  We calculate that the associated boycotted mortgages are probably around 2% of the outstanding mortgage balances. But people are not saying that they are not willing to pay the mortgages forever. As long as the projects resume construction and there is assurance that the project will be properly completed, they say they will still pay the mortgages.  So I think itâ\\x80\\x99s less about the mortgage risk at the moment. Itâ\\x80\\x99s more about the homebuyersâ\\x80\\x99 confidence toward private developersâ\\x80\\x99 projects, especially the ones that are really in trouble with debt payments.  How big is this issue, and how would you quantify it?  The reality is that what you are seeing today in terms of the number of projects that are in boycott is probably just a very small portion of the total number of projects that might have completion risk.  We estimate that at the end of last year, the total amount of properties that had been pre-sold since 2018 but not yet completed encompassed about 2.4 billion square meters: so 2.4 billion square-meters worth of projects are scheduled to be completed from this year to 2024, 2025. But if we just focus on what will be completed in the next 12 months, itâ\\x80\\x99s about 800 to 900 million square meters in total.  Taking private developersâ\\x80\\x99 approximate share of 60% of that, that gives you about 480 million to 540 million square meters. For the more than 300 projects that are really in boycott, thatâ\\x80\\x99s probably just 70 million square meters of that. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not to say that all of these 480 million to 540 million square-meters of projects cannot be completed by private developers, but the size is likely more significant than what we are seeing in the market.  Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the reason we donâ\\x80\\x99t think solving the current boycotts is enough. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a need for the government to take a more systematic approach to understand the liquidity situation of the funding gap in the private developer space, and to assess the funding needs for the next 12 months at least to contain the completion risk, in our view.  How difficult would it be for the government to contain this issue?  If developers officially default on the completion, then you can imagine how many families will be involved in chasing the money back from developers. Certainly developers wonâ\\x80\\x99t have sufficient funds to repay all the proceeds they got from buyers.  We have to think about the contingent impact if confidence collapses. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the worst case. Of course, the cost for the government to eliminate completion risk in the next 12 months in our calculation is not very big. Itâ\\x80\\x99s around 600 billion RMB. As long as this 600 billion RMB can be provided, the completion risk for next year will be largely eliminated according to our estimate.  If the government takes action more quickly, then the confidence can likely be restored. After all, the government has initiated a lot of policy stimulus since April, and demand is actually recovering since June from the very low level in April and May. The risk is that the recovery is impeded or disappears. In a more optimistic scenario, confidence is restored, helping drive a sustainable recovery, so eventually the credit system can get back to normal and private developersâ\\x80\\x99 credit issues can resolved. But now it seems we are reversing back to the pre-June level if confidence is deteriorating again.  Are the megatrends within the Chinese property still intact or changing?  The key demographic drivers for the housing market are population growth and urbanization, which translate into urban housing formation. But these are slowing. The population is growing a lot slower than it was 10 years ago, and more than 64% of the population now lives in urban areas and so that urbanization trend is also slowing.  What is the GS Research view on Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s housing market?  Itâ\\x80\\x99s still the case that we expect a multiyear downturn. The government likely initiated this deleveraging process because they know that the current supply capacity is way above the long-term underlying demand level. Shrinking the supply capacity is needed to avoid more pain down the road.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Signs that the U.S. economy is slowing are increasing. A key question is whether it has decelerated enough to bring down inflation without tipping into recession.  Gross domestic product shrank for a second consecutive quarter, according to data reported last week, meeting a common threshold for recession. But it would be â\\x80\\x9cstrangeâ\\x80\\x9d to classify the first six months of the year â\\x80\\x94 a period marked by a booming job market â\\x80\\x94 that way, says David Mericle, chief U.S. economist in Goldman Sachs Research. The National Bureau of Economic Research uses a wide range of criteria to make the official call on whether the U.S. economy has gone into recession.  Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not to say a full-blown downturn couldnâ\\x80\\x99t happen: economists at Goldman see elevated recession risk over the next two years. They expect the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of rate hikes to 50 basis points in September and 25 basis points in November and December, eventually topping out at a rate of 3.25% to 3.5%.  Mericle says there are indications the Fed has managed to temper growth in GDP enough to start rebalancing the labor market and supply and demand within the economy, but it remains to be seen whether that will be enough to slow increases in consumer prices back to the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s 2% goal on a reasonable time horizon. We spoke with Mericle about the latest GDP report and the metrics heâ\\x80\\x99s monitoring to assess the U.S. economy.  Goldman Sachs Research noted last week that the official definition of recession is a judgmental mix of metrics across several variables, most of which continued to expand in the first half of the year. Does that mean you think the U.S. is not in recession?  Yes. Other indicators of economy activity â\\x80\\x94 payroll employment, real personal income net of government transfer payments, and industrial production â\\x80\\x94 grew in the first half of this year. I think it would be strange to classify the first half of the year, a period of significant labor market progress, as a recession.  Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not to say that weâ\\x80\\x99re in the clear â\\x80\\x94 solving the inflation problem without a recession is still going to be challenging â\\x80\\x94 but I donâ\\x80\\x99t think weâ\\x80\\x99ve fallen into a recession yet.    Where did you see signs of strength and weakness in last weekâ\\x80\\x99s GDP report?  My take is that the economy has undergone a needed deceleration to a pace of growth that is below its long-term potential growth rate, but has probably not entered into a recession. We argued at the start of the year that the Fed needed to tighten policy by more than was then anticipated in order to slow growth to a below-potential pace so that supply grows more quickly than demand and the two come back into balance. Thanks to the fiscal and monetary policy tightening that has already been delivered or signalled this year, it appears that weâ\\x80\\x99re now on the desired trajectory.  Digging into the details of the GDP report, consumer spending grew at a 1% rate, which is roughly where weâ\\x80\\x99d like overall GDP growth to be. Residential investment dropped very sharply, which is to be expected when monetary policy tightening raises mortgage rates sharply. Business investment declined in Q2, and while I expect it to start growing again in the second half of this year, weâ\\x80\\x99re keeping a close eye on it because this is the area where we would worry most about the risk that deteriorating business sentiment could depress activity too much, too fast.  Do you think the GDP report will change the thinking at the Fed in regards to interest rates, and has it changed your expectations for Fed policy going forward?  We havenâ\\x80\\x99t changed our forecast. We continue to expect the Fed to slow the pace of tightening at its remaining meetings this year.  Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been expecting that for two reasons. First, we thought theyâ\\x80\\x99d want to move in smaller increments once the level of the funds rate reached, and especially once it exceeded, their estimate of the neutral rate.  Second, we thought that once it became clear that growth is slowing more decisively, Fed officials would start to put more weight on that and shift away from their recent, more single-minded emphasis on the inflation data.  We heard both of these points from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the July Fed meeting. Fed officials are still committed to trying to solve the inflation problem in a gentle way through a gradual rebalancing of supply and demand, and they seem to agree with our assessment that weâ\\x80\\x99re now on a low enough growth trajectory that it makes sense to start preparing to slow the pace of rate hikes to avoid inadvertently overdoing it.  What metrics are you and the team watching closely right now as you monitor the economy?  Big picture, the Fed is aiming to (1) keep economic growth below its long-run potential rate in order to (2) rebalance supply and demand in the labor market and (3) bring down wage growth and inflation. So weâ\\x80\\x99re monitoring measures that tell us how weâ\\x80\\x99re doing on those three goals. So far I would say the activity data broadly suggest weâ\\x80\\x99re doing well on (1), the employment and job openings data suggest weâ\\x80\\x99re off to a very good start on (2) but have further to go, and the wage growth and inflation data suggest we havenâ\\x80\\x99t made convincing progress yet on (3).'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The tried and tested 60/40 formula for buy-and-hold investment portfolios got off to its worst start since World War II.  The 60/40 portfolio â\\x80\\x94 split between the S&P 500 Index of stocks (60%) and 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds (40%) â\\x80\\x94 fell about 20% in the first half of 2022, the biggest decline on record for the start of a year, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Such â\\x80\\x98balancedâ\\x80\\x99 portfolios, meant to blend the higher risk of stocks with the relative safety of government bonds, often have different formulations, such as a mix of corporate credit or international stocks. But virtually all of them had one of their worst starts to a year ever, according to Christian Mueller-Glissmann, head of asset allocation research within portfolio strategy at Goldman Sachs.    Almost all assets were in a precarious position at the start of the year, as valuations for stocks and bonds were hovering around their highest levels in a century, Mueller-Glissmann says. Decades of tame inflation allowed central banks to drive interest rates ever lower to try to smooth out the business cycle, which in turn pushed assets from stocks to house prices higher. In fact, in the decade before the COVID-19 crisis, a simple U.S. 60/40 portfolio delivered three-times its long-run average for risk-adjusted returns.    And then 2022 hit. As consumer prices and wages accelerated, central banks like the Federal Reserve scrambled to reverse their policies. That resulted in one of the biggest ever jumps in real yields (bonds yields minus the rate of inflation). As policy makers try to contain skyrocketing inflation, stock investors are increasingly concerned that those efforts will slow growth, potentially tipping large economies like the U.S. into recession. Indeed, investor concerns have recently shifted from inflation to recession concerns as soaring inflation expectations have fallen, but it might be too early to fade inflation risks, at least in the medium-term, says Mueller-Glissmann.   â\\x80\\x9cIn contrast to the last cycle, youâ\\x80\\x99ve had a mix of growth and inflation conditions that are quite unfriendly,â\\x80\\x9d Mueller-Glissmann says. Rising inflation weighs on bonds, as does monetary policy tightening (when central banks increase interest rates). This also means weaker growth, meanwhile, which is a headwind for equities, and equity valuations suffer from rising rates as well. â\\x80\\x9cThat is a backdrop thatâ\\x80\\x99s very bad for 60/40 portfolios, irrespective of valuations,â\\x80\\x9d he said.  That means thereâ\\x80\\x99s less diversification potential between equities and bonds, as they have been more positively correlated this year â\\x80\\x94 in fact this has been more often the case than not historically.    A funny thing about the 60/40 portfolio is that nobody really knows where it comes from. While itâ\\x80\\x99s a popular benchmark, Mueller-Glissmann points out that it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be right for everyone. A person close to retirement might want a larger proportion of their savings in bonds, for example, while someone investing at the start of their career would probably want to buy more stocks.  The 60/40 may still make sense as a starting point for asset allocation. It has been the optimal ratio on average since 1900 to maximise the risk-to-reward for a portfolio made up of only stocks and bonds (although the optimal allocation to equities has varied materially over time depending on broader macro conditions), Goldman Sachs Research shows.    The outlook for the 60/40, however, might not improve right away, as long as inflation is percolating up and central bank tightening weighs on growth. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think itâ\\x80\\x99s dead, because the current environment wonâ\\x80\\x99t last forever, but itâ\\x80\\x99s certainly ill-suited for that type of backdrop,â\\x80\\x9d Mueller-Glissmann says. â\\x80\\x9cIn an environment where you have both growth risk and inflation risks, like stagflation, 60/40 portfolios are vulnerable and to some extent incomplete. You want to diversify more broadly to asset classes that can do better in that environment.â\\x80\\x9d  Real assets could be more important in a cycle where inflation is higher than the world has been used to over the past two or three decades. Things like residential real estate can generate profits that exceed inflation. Precious metals and even fine art and classic cars can help protect purchasing power when consumer and commodity prices are climbing quickly.    A portfolio with a slice of real assets, like gold and real estate, performed even better than the 60/40 over the long run. In that case the optimal strategic asset allocation since World War II was closer to one-third equity, one-third bonds and one-third real assets, Mueller-Glissmann says.  â\\x80\\x9cI think thatâ\\x80\\x99s a better starting point as compared to 60/40, with everything we know right now, with potentially higher structural-inflation pressures due to decarbonization, deglobalization and the fight on income inequality,â\\x80\\x9d Mueller-Glissmann says. He points out that there are also stocks that can have the characteristics of real assets, such as companies that have pricing power and the capacity to grow cash flows at a rate that exceeds inflation.  Investors can also consider assets that fight inflation. â\\x80\\x9cAutomation is an example, if you find business models that benefit from structural growth because of higher inflation,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s plenty of opportunities that come about because of this new world where we have more inflation and more inflation uncertainty. But the most important thing is they are very different from what we saw as the best investment of the past 20 to 30 years.â\\x80\\x9d  Investors have picked up on this shift. Instead of a tech startup that might not produce a profit until many years from now, investors are favoring companies that can already produce earnings and dividends. Warehouses have been a popular investment as e-commerce accelerates. Demand for companies that make battery storage has grown amid an increasing focus on renewable energy infrastructure.    But as recession risks rise, some real assets have also become more volatile in recent months. Nobel prize winning economist Harry Markowitz is credited with saying that diversification is the only free lunch in finance. Mueller-Glissmann says that principle applies to investing in real assets as well. They tend to be heterogeneous, with different risks.  Real estate investment trusts (REITs), for example, tend to keep up with inflation in the long run, but theyâ\\x80\\x99re highly leveraged and perform poorly during a recession. Infrastructure, such as a company that operates an airport or a sewage system, might have steady cash flows from government contracts. But thereâ\\x80\\x99s still a risk that company could be hit with new tax charges or regulation. And while commodities like oil and grains are essential basic needs, their prices tend to be extremely volatile when there are imbalances between supply and demand.  â\\x80\\x9cYou want to have a bit of diversification within real assets as well,â\\x80\\x9d Mueller-Glissmann says. Goldman Sachs Research has run the numbers and found that a roughly equal weight (about 25% in each) between real estate, infrastructure, gold and a broad commodity index has led to the best risk-adjusted performance in periods of high inflation. Allocations to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which were created in the late 1990s and are a more defensive real asset, can help lower cyclical risk while providing inflation protection.  Going forward, active portfolio management, allocations to alternative assets â\\x80\\x94 such as private equity but may also include hedge funds â\\x80\\x94 and new strategies for mitigating risk, like option hedges, are going to be more important in multi-asset investing, Mueller-Glissmann said.  â\\x80\\x9cI would disagree that diversification is the only free lunch in finance,â\\x80\\x9d he added. â\\x80\\x9cBut certainly it remains a core investment principle for any investor.â\\x80\\x9d'},\n",

       "  'content': 'A strong position on climate, governance and inclusion is more than a question of good risk management â\\x80\\x94 itâ\\x80\\x99s also good business, says Bertie Whitehead, managing director and EMEA head of ESG in investment banking at Goldman Sachs. Investors are increasingly asking if companies are tapping into growth areas such as the energy transition and the waste-reducing circular economy, Whitehead says: â\\x80\\x9cWe used to call these megatrends, but itâ\\x80\\x99s simply growth investing. This is where capital is going.â\\x80\\x9d  The flipside of this effort is identifying and managing risks. This played out in the immediate aftermath of Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s invasion of Ukraine, as corporations rapidly revaluated their strategy. â\\x80\\x9cWe saw many companies putting values over value and withdrawing from the region,â\\x80\\x9d Whitehead says. â\\x80\\x9cCompanies that were slower to respond found themselves under more than just visible social media pressure â\\x80\\x94 stores were boycotted.â\\x80\\x9d  We sat down with Whitehead to discuss how companies and investors are responding to the opportunities and risks around climate, governance and inclusion.   For some time, Europe has been seen as a leader in climate finance and investment, with a particularly supportive regulatory environment. How has that forced or helped clients evolve their posture?  What is interesting about Europe is that there was a joint journey from both regulators and capital allocators to move towards a sustainable future. This is different for instance from the U.S. where the lead was very much taken by the capital allocators and corporates initially.  This helped Europe set the lead on disclosure, from a corporate, a fund manager and financial institution perspective. And disclosure is key here â\\x80\\x94 to use the axiom of â\\x80\\x9cyou can only manage what you measureâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 and this gave Europe that head start.  Are there notable differences in approach between listed companies, private companies?  Absolutely, but this in part is down to the maturity of exposure, and in part down to geographical bias. A lot of developed economy companies have been exposed to the white heat of investor pressures for a number of years now, and they have seen how this translated into valuation differentials and voting patterns at annual meetings. So they had additional pressures to respond quicker.  For many private companies, the pressures were different, in part as their ownership structures were narrower and so they did not get the same breadth of pressures. Where private and public companies are similar is on some of the pressures from the other stakeholdersâ\\x80\\x94customers, employees and of course regulators.  But the maturity gap is closing and this means that there is growing sophistication in both private and public companies with both sets now increasingly collecting data, setting targets and communicating impact. The commercial opportunity is now in play.  How is the focus on sustainable investing impacting capital allocation in the private equity industry particularly?  At its heart, focusing on sustainability and ESG is good business practice. Identify and minimize risks. Protect margin from future compression. Pivot the business to growth.  The private sphere is often overlooked, when actually private equity funds are racing to create sustainable funds. In Europe alone, ESG private-equity assets under management has grown from 13% of funds in 2015 to 17.5% in 2020. If market expectations  are correct that this will rise to be more than 20% in 2025, it means that more than 60% of new PE flows will need to be into ESG funds.  This is down to a push and pull. The push is that their investors â\\x80\\x94 the asset owners â\\x80\\x94 are demanding sustainable investment. The pull is that sustainable investing is growth investing â\\x80\\x94 and better, deeper due diligence on risks! â\\x80\\x94 but through a different lens.  This gives rise to different questions. For example, as the global economy transitions during what will be the most significant shift in capital in history, which companies are exposed to the high-growth areas of the market? And can you use data and policy to identify the risks are that idiosyncratic to each business and how well they are being managed?    Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 forced certain companies to change their strategy in Eastern Europe and Russia. How are factors like climate, governance and inclusion shaping corporate strategy over the short, medium, and long term?  It should go without saying that no one wanted a humanitarian tragedy to be a catalyst for corporate strategy change.  In the immediate aftermath, we saw many companies putting values over value and withdrawing from the region. Those consumer-facing companies that were slower to respond found themselves under more than just visible social media pressure â\\x80\\x94 stores were boycotted and, for some slower responding retailers, business is still very slow.  The medium term impact was then intense focus on energy availability, not least because of Europeâ\\x80\\x99s dependence on Russian energy flows, and to restore generation capacity through whatever means possible, including coal. With gas prices across developing nations persistently high, that pressure remains.  The long tail is then a much greater understanding of energy security and resilient supply â\\x80\\x94 through self-generation or trusted partnerships â\\x80\\x94 including the use of hydrocarbons in the near term. Itâ\\x80\\x99s quite telling that the largest IPO in Europe since Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s invasion was for a hydrogen company, De Nora, that we were delighted to lead.  There is also a growing link between the E and less mentioned S.  In many instances, you need the S to enable progress on environment.  Look at, for instance, Brazil: To avoid deforestation you need a strong social policy to educate, incentivize and provide individuals with the tools to enable them to generate income without destroying forests.   The governance question is becoming universally important â\\x80\\x94 namely do you truly know your supply chain from top to tail? This is leading to a far greater push to rapidly understand resiliencies.  For investors working to operationalize sustainability, data is critical. How are investors using sustainability data in their investment frameworks? What data are they using and what are they trying to assess?  Millions of data points on sustainability have been created, consumed and analyzed. Each fund manager has a slightly different input set, and these are vast and varied. Still, they are being used generally to understand two key things: how to preserve alpha, and how to further create it.  For the former, data and policies are being used to get a handle on each companyâ\\x80\\x99s idiosyncratic risks and how well they are being managed. Identifying these risks means that investors can adjust what theyâ\\x80\\x99re willing to pay.  The other side of the coin is opportunity: alpha creation. Is the company attaching itself to some of the more significant growth areas in the market such as the energy transition, inclusion â\\x80\\x94 so accessing a wider pool of customers and removing historic frictions â\\x80\\x94 the circular economy, or the growing population? We used to call these megatrends, but itâ\\x80\\x99s more simply growth investing. This is where consumer money is going.  Climate, governance, and inclusion considerations are regularly considered in terms of risk and exposureâ\\x80\\x94how are companies reframing their strategies to realize opportunities?  There is still a pervasive feeling that sustainability is either a luxury good â\\x80\\x94 particularly recently â\\x80\\x94 or a distraction from â\\x80\\x9cpure business.â\\x80\\x9d This couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be farther than the truth: itâ\\x80\\x99s also about maximizing your operating potential as a company. Treating employees well means lower staff turnover. Having inclusive hiring policies will yield the best people. Minimizing your environmental footprint can make for increased sales because customers are now really prioritizing the issue. This is driving M&A pivots, as our clients dispose of assets that generate higher carbon, or look to buy more sustainable, resilient businesses.  The data is instructive : the median EV/EBITDA (the ratio of enterprise value to earnings-before-interest-taxes-depreciation-amortization) multiple in LBO transactions between 2017-2021 was around 12.7 times. Our observations of sustainability themed transactions show multiples commonly in excess of the average, with some more than 50% above this. This is the premia in action.  How are clients considering sustainability and inclusion in the context of rising inflation and recession risks?  Put plainly, sustainability and ESG at scale havenâ\\x80\\x99t travelled through a true recession yet. If the early stages of the pandemic are any guide, what we saw was an acceleration towards these factors â\\x80\\x94 in particular the S and the protection of colleagues. Generally speaking, I think people vastly underestimate how far public opinion has progressed on issues related to climate, governance and inclusion â\\x80\\x93 even since the start of the pandemic in 2020.   Now, to be pragmatic, of course companies cut back from growth investment during a recession. It happens all the time. Does this stand in the way of the long run trend of greater capex (or public opinion) to drive sustainable growth? Absolutely not.  On managing the cost of living and energy costs, according to Michele Della Vignaâ\\x80\\x99s Carbonomics Research, if the state covers upfront implementation costs, household bills could be 50% lower in the future through renewables.  What do you see as the future for this space?  We are, in my view, now beyond the tipping point. Asset flows in Europe in both public and private spheres will be increasingly be dominated by sustainable and inclusive tilts. Capital will flow to those companies that can prove themselves to be risk insulators and growth companies.  Disclosure will enable this. But the pace of disclosure and data around key topics will, and should increase. Carbon data in a sustainability report can be two years old. Would you invest on the basis of two-year-old data? Or would you prefer real-time data from low earth orbit satellites with geo-tagged factories, logistics routes and all of the suppliers too? As a business owner, you will want assurance on compliance from your entire supply chain to ensure that customers have the confidence to buy your product. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a huge data mountain to climb and weâ\\x80\\x99re on the foothills.  In my view, the risks arenâ\\x80\\x99t around technology.  There will be innovations and improvements, but the core technologies exist. The challenge is scaling and getting the abundant capital, in the right format, to the right projects.

       "  'content': \"The tensions between Russia and the rest of Europe over natural gas flows have underscored the unsustainability of the continentâ\\x80\\x99s energy system. But with the right mix of infrastructure investment, Europe can emerge from the upheaval with a system that is cheaper, achieves the continentâ\\x80\\x99s net-zero carbon emissions goals and is more secure. The spending is estimated to eventually pay for itself from savings on energy imports, according to Goldman Sachs Research.  It will take â\\x82¬10 trillion of investment by 2050 for Europe to transform its energy infrastructure, according to Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Carbonomics framework. That amounts to around â\\x82¬350 billion each year, around 2% of gross domestic product by 2030.  The overhauled system would dramatically shore up energy independence though it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t eliminate imports entirely. The continent would still need to buy some fossil fuels for chemicals manufacturing and to import some of its green hydrogen. Goldman Sachs Research estimates that the region can cut its dependency on energy imports from 58% to 15% by 2050.  The new system would be more affordable. The energy costs for the average European consumer could be cut by 40% versus prices in 2021 (and by 60% compared to the expected peak this year) through improved energy efficiency, lower-cost liquefied natural gas (LNG), cheaper renewables and better regional connectivity.  Natural gas is going to be a key part of Europeâ\\x80\\x99s energy supply for the next 20 years, according to Goldman Sachs Research. The region has historically been reluctant to sign up to long-term LNG contracts, and the result is a heavy reliance on gas imports via pipeline. Given the tensions between western powers and Russia over the war in Ukraine, that system isnâ\\x80\\x99t sustainable.  For Europe to hit its goals to cut and eventually eliminate its reliance on Russian gas, the EU will need to increase LNG imports, according to modelling by Goldman Sachs Research. A series of 10- and 15-year contracts would strengthen energy security and allow a new generation of LNG projects to be developed for Europe.  While natural gas will remain important for decades, renewable power â\\x80\\x94 such as solar and onshore and offshore wind â\\x80\\x94 will be at the heart of the future energy system. Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Carbonomics research shows that electrification is the most important driver of lower emissions and reduced dependence on energy imports. That effort will also require major investments in domestic battery production.  Seasonality and the energy requirements for transportation and heavy industry mean that green hydrogen will also be a key component and will eventually make up 15% of the energy system. The EU will need an interconnected system of power networks and hydrogen pipelines to substitute hydrocarbon imports with clean energy flows from low cost producers such as Iberia, parts of Southern Europe and the U.K. to the rest of Europe.  It will take time and investment, but there is a way forward for European leaders: modelling by Goldman Sachs Research indicates that the EU can strengthen its energy independence in the face of the Russia-Ukraine crisis without compromising its climate change ambitions.       20 JUL 2022 Goldman Sachs Research Carbonomics: Re-Imagining Europe's Energy System Read Report\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"As tensions mount between Russia and western powers over the invasion of Ukraine, a critical question is how much natural gas will flow through Nord Stream 1, a vital pipeline between Germany and Russia.  Europeâ\\x80\\x99s largest economy and other eurozone nations are deeply dependent on the gas that flows through the pipeline, which closed for maintenance this month. While media reports indicate it will reopen at reduced capacity, speculation has swirled that it could remain shuttered.  A full shutdown, while not their base case, could drive European household energy costs up by about 65% to around â\\x82¬500 ($512) per month, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs Research. Industries like chemicals and cement in Germany and Italy might have to cut their gas usage by as much as 80%. The euro-area economy would likely shrink by more than 2% through March 2023, with GDP in Italy and Germany declining as much as 4% and 3% respectively.  Even before the pipeline was closed for annual maintenance, gas supply through Nord Stream 1 had already reduced by more than half, raising questions over Europeâ\\x80\\x99s energy security. We spoke with two experts in Goldman Sachs Research â\\x80\\x94 Alberto Gandolfi, who leads the European utilities team, and Christian Schnittker, a European economist â\\x80\\x94 about their expectations for Russian gas flows to the rest of the continent and how the squeeze on the commodity is filtering through the economy.    Firstly, can you give us some background on the European energy sector: How much gas does Europe get from Russia?  Alberto Gandolfi: About 25% of European primary energy consumption is from natural gas. So, natural gas is a very important commodity. And just to be clear: the gas market was already quite tight in January 2022. Not only was there a strong bounce in consumption and demand as several countries came out of lockdowns during the pandemic, but there hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been an influx of new energy supply projects. This meant that gas prices were high even before Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s invasion.  Then the war started and this created two clear issues. The first was around affordability. Russia did not initially reduce gas flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline but obviously the risk premium in the market started to lift prices. All of this continued escalating until a few weeks ago, when we noticed that Russian gas flows into Europe started to decline significantly, especially into Germany. Russia claimed this was due to technical issues, but Germany labelled the gas reduction as politically motivated. Ultimately, by lowering the gas flow into Europe, Russia is able to indirectly or not so indirectly influence the benchmark TTF gas price (an index that determines market gas price) and essentially create an affordability problem in Europe.  The second issue is that this change in gas flow creates an energy security problem. If Europe receives half, or even less, of the gas itâ\\x80\\x99s supposed to, gas rationing may become more prominent into the autumn. Gas consumption in winter is about two-and-a-half times the level it is in summer and as we move into winter, if Europe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t get enough Russian gas, it could be problematic for countries like Italy and Germany. While Italy has been looking for alternative energy sources, Germany doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have as many options and we estimate it could mean a 65% industry curtailment in Germany if flows stopped coming entirely.  There has been annual maintenance going on at Nord Stream 1, which makes this situation even more difficult to understand. How do you expect Russian gas flows to impact countries like Germany going forward?  Christian Schnittker: On July 11th gas flows from Russia via Nord Stream 1 fell to zero, which is down to annual maintenance that happens at this time every year. The key date will be July 21st as that is when the maintenance is scheduled to end and we should have some clarity on the direction that gas flows will go. Our analysis points to a significant hit to activity â\\x80\\x94 especially in Germany and Italy â\\x80\\x94 if gas flows donâ\\x80\\x99t go up after that.  Germany is highly exposed to this issue and thatâ\\x80\\x99s why we see Germany in our scenarios at the forefront of this issue. A little under half of German gas is used for household heating and cooling, about a third is used for industrial use and the remainder is for other uses.    Our current baseline â\\x80\\x94 and all of this depends on what happens after July 21st â\\x80\\x94 is that we get back to the status quo, we get back to 40% of flows through Nord Stream 1. The risk case is that Russian gas flows are curtailed entirely. There are also two upside scenarios, one where it gets back to 65% of gas flows or even 100%.  In our scenarios of subdued gas flows over the next year, TTF prices and inflation levels will remain elevated, which will ultimately lead to a slowdown in consumption. On the production side, gas intensive industries will likely see a cut to gas supplies and that, in our baseline scenario, will push Germany into a recession.  However, if gas flows did drop to zero, the outcomes become more severe: utility bills will go up; consumers will experience a real confidence shock; and there will be a curtailment in industrial gas demand in order to preserve household heating ability. In this case, we see Germany going into a deep recession, with negative quarter on quarter growth next year and growth in Germany as a whole at only 0.1% in 2022 and -1.6% for 2023. Elsewhere, we see large hits to output in Italy, too, but smaller impacts in France and Spain.  A total curtailment of Russian gas from Nord Stream 1 sounds alarming. How could this impact ordinary people?  Alberto Gandolfi: If the worst case scenario does happen, and Russian gas falls to zero, there are two big implications. The first one is a spike in procurement costs which would essentially mean a 65% increase in power and gas bills from the high levels of today. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a significant increase for families.   The second implication is really about volume. There is not going to be enough gas around for industries, so gas intensive companies working across chemicals, glass, paper, steel, cement, etc., will be impacted and will need to reduce production there, which could trigger things like furloughs.  The affordability issue will be felt much more in winter; this is when the actual euro spend per family will be felt. If flows go to zero, itâ\\x80\\x99s going to compound and winter is going to be really, really tough both for families and the economy. But letâ\\x80\\x99s not forget to say here we donâ\\x80\\x99t know if flows will go to zero. At the moment, the base case is that flows remain sub run rate, like between 30-50% below normal, but they donâ\\x80\\x99t go to zero.    Is there anything European countries like Germany can do to alleviate the impact of this crisis?  Christian Schnittker: This challenge is different from COVID-19. During the pandemic, restaurants and retail were shut down for lockdown, but once they reopened, things would bounce back relatively quickly. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what we have seen over the last couple of years. This issue over gas is complicated as it requires more structural change. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a longer-burn issue in some ways and thatâ\\x80\\x99s why we have a negative outlook for 2023.  If gas flows do dwindle, greater fiscal support from governments might be required, furlough schemes might be reactivated, and we may see more support for households, low income households and even some corporates.  Across Europe, we have already seen measures like price caps and greater fiscal support for consumers. In France, for example, they effectively capped electricity and gas prices roughly since the end of last year for consumers. This means consumers take less of a hit.  If things do take a turn for the worse, governments could step up and pay more excess energy costs and recoup it in the future through higher network charges or higher taxes. This would basically smooth the hit out over the time. In Germany, the discussions are ongoing and the broader response is a work on progress, but I imagine there will be an approach ready in July, when flows resume for Nord Stream 1.       20 JUL 2022 Goldman Sachs Research Carbonomics: Re-Imagining Europe's Energy System Read Report\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses community represents a network of more than 245,000 employees, more than 12,000 businesses served and more than $17bn in total annual revenues.  Small businesses are the first to be buffeted by difficult economic conditions, but even for the most agile and experienced among them, the current operating environment is particularly rough. Many small businesses were slammed when the COVID-19 pandemic tore through the global economy, and from surging gas prices to staff retention, the challenges just keep coming.  According to a June survey of more than 1,500 members of Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 10,000 Small Businesses program, 78% of small business owners believe the economy has worsened in the last three months, and 93% are worried about the U.S. economy experiencing a recession.  This is a stormy outlook, but there are two reasons for optimism: the creativity, resourcefulness, and fortitude of Americaâ\\x80\\x99s small business owners, and their support for bipartisan policy solutions, including reauthorizing and modernizing the Small Business Administration.  Economic Conditions  For many small businesses, the economic environment is problem enough: 89% of small business owners say broader economic trends, such as inflation, supply chain issues, and workforce challenges, are having a negative impact on their business. Gas prices alone are causing headaches, as some 80% say higher gas prices are negatively impacting their business.     For Suzanne Batlle, owner of Azucar Ice Cream, which has stores in Miami and Dallas, these trends impact almost every cup of ice cream she sells: â\\x80\\x9cThe cost of milk alone is up 50%, to say nothing of logistics. A shipment of ice cream cups I ordered three months ago is finally due to be delivered â\\x80\\x94 but now Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have to pay an outrageous freight charge. Everywhere you turn thereâ\\x80\\x99s a roadblock, and small businesses are getting slammed.â\\x80\\x9d  Batlle is not alone among her peers. Almost two-thirds of those polled by Goldman Sachs have increased the prices of goods sold or services offered to offset inflation and other economic obstacles.  Getting the Workforce Right  For many small businesses, finding and retaining qualified employees remains the most vital concern, even more than both inflation and supply chain issues.  More than 40% of those polled said hiring challenges had worsened over the last three months, with 87% of those hiring finding it difficult to recruit qualified candidates for open positions. There was almost unanimous agreement among those small business owners that difficulty with hiring is impacting their bottom line.  Such was the shortage of skilled labor in Iowa, that Perlla DeLuca, owner and CEO of Southeast Constructors in Des Moines, took workforce shortages into her own hands: by opening a construction school to train new employees.  â\\x80\\x9cThe pandemic certainly made things more difficult, but we were already struggling with workforce shortages before COVID-19 hit. Almost an entire generation of workers â\\x80\\x94 those who would be trained in the family construction business â\\x80\\x94 are missing. We need a fix for that, which is why weâ\\x80\\x99ll be opening our school in September,â\\x80\\x9d says DeLuca.  In time, DeLuca plans to educate more than 1,000 students a year in the 20,000-square-foot building sheâ\\x80\\x99s refurbishing. Like many small business owners, DeLuca will be operating this new venture alongside her existing construction business.  Of small business owners having difficulty hiring, 63% cited high labor costs as a reason for their challenges, with competition against larger employers on pay and benefits a critical obstacle.  Hiring Help  About 90% of respondents would support policymakers taking action to help address small business workforce and competitiveness challenges. Policy solutions to address these concerns already exist. Policymakers should also support small businesses in their quest to offer retirement plans, as well as workplace training and certification.     As David Simnick, co-founder and CEO of Soapbox Soaps in Washington D.C., notes, thereâ\\x80\\x99s good reason to support small business hiring: â\\x80\\x9cIf you look at job creation around the world, it is often not coming from incredibly well established organizations. The jobs are coming from upstarts and entrepreneurs.â\\x80\\x9d  Renewing programs like the Employee Retention Credit, which gave employers tax credits for wages paid to workers but expired in 2021, and enhancing the Paid Family and Medical Leave tax credit, which needs to be better advertised and understood, are vital first steps â\\x80\\x94 with plenty of upside.  Kei Okumura of Sugarbird Sweets and Teas in Los Angeles says it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t take much to encourage entrepreneurial immigrant communities to take part in existing programs: â\\x80\\x9cA lot of people are resistant to things that are too good to be true. More information would have a big impact in different communities and different cultures.â\\x80\\x9d  Small Business, Macro View  Macroeconomics really matter. Almost 40% of small business owners have seen a decline in customer demand as a result of inflationary price increases, and 75% say their businessâ\\x80\\x99s financial health over the past six months has been negatively impacted by inflation, which is up 9.1% in the past year according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Michelle Pusateri, owner of Nana Joes Granola in San Francisco, has taken a series of steps to navigate inflation: â\\x80\\x9cBeing able to secure ingredients is my primary concern. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been working with suppliers â\\x80\\x93 farms â\\x80\\x93 directly, which helps their margins and normally allows us to buy more. More generally, weâ\\x80\\x99ve been buying in bulk to protect against price volatility. Securing ingredients by the literal truckload has ensured our ability to deliver, but the flipside is that it puts huge pressure on our working capital. In June, I had to take out a loan to make the numbers work.â\\x80\\x9d  Still, bags of Nana Joes Granola have changed in size. â\\x80\\x9cWe were really transparent with our customers, and carefully planned our communications that we have had to reduce the quantity in the bags to ensure prices on the shelves didnâ\\x80\\x99t change,â\\x80\\x9d said Pusateri.  Between inflation and supply chain issues, itâ\\x80\\x99s a one-two punch: almost 80% of respondents say supply chain issues have either persisted or worsened in the last three months, and only a handful (9%) expect their supply chain issues to subside within the next six months.  A differentiating factor for Pusateri given supply line snarls has been the strength of her supplier relationships: â\\x80\\x9cI really try to keep the lines of communication open, and lead with compassion and empathy. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not just a transactional relationship. Our suppliers are struggling in this environment too. Looking out for each other and treating folks with mutual respect is absolutely a reason why the ingredients we need are available to us.â\\x80\\x9d  As with labor concerns, thereâ\\x80\\x99s clear support for policymakers to take action: almost 90% of respondents would support policymakers taking action to help address inflation and supply chain challenges.  For many small businesses and their employees, the stakes are high: â\\x80\\x9cWho wants to take out a loan just to stay in business? Where does that end? I havenâ\\x80\\x99t got a Plan B here â\\x80\\x94 and neither do my fifty employees,â\\x80\\x9d says Batlle.  Capital City  As at the height of the pandemic, a component of the solution is access to flexible, affordable capital. Access to credit (or relief) is vital if small businesses are going to have to compete in inflationary markets or work their way around a disrupted supply chain.  There are other benefits to making capital more accessible. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a small business is typically up against nowadays are large companies consolidating with smaller companies,â\\x80\\x9d says Michael Cao, founder and CEO of IC3D in Columbus, Ohio. â\\x80\\x9cCapital formation thatâ\\x80\\x99s non-dilutive makes a huge difference as small businesses look to compete.â\\x80\\x9d  Capital is particularly key for the most underrepresented groups: programs like Community Advantage, which provides loans to Black and Hispanic small business owners, should continue being extended or made permanent.  Small Business Administration, Big Impact  If policymakers are to match the ambition and potential of U.S. small businesses, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll need to deliver concrete policy changes. Of foundational importance would be the renewal of the Small Business Administration, which was last reauthorized more than twenty years ago.  Polling suggests broad support: 88% of small business owners say it is important for Congress to prioritize reauthorizing the SBA. As DeLuca notes, â\\x80\\x9cThe SBA as it exists today just isnâ\\x80\\x99t set up for small businesses, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.â\\x80\\x9d    For Pusateri, some of the fixes are straightforward: â\\x80\\x9cFilling out the paperwork for an SBA loan is itself a job, and it can be incredibly confusing. The sheer volume of forms made it impossible for some companies to apply for the right loans, and get the access to funds they needed. An SBA support framework â\\x80\\x94 even examples of all the documents perfectly executed like a sample loan application â\\x80\\x94 would have been really helpful.â\\x80\\x9d  A reinvigorated SBA, equipped with additional resources and new capabilities, could play a key role in driving a bipartisan agenda devoted to helping small businesses realize their full potential.  Despite the many headwinds, there are plentiful opportunities for small businesses to grow. Of the many enterprises Goldman Sachs works with through 10,000 Small Businesses, almost all have set their sights on their next big move. In fact, 65% of those polled say they are optimistic about the financial trajectory of their business this year.  This is not a question of charity or handouts. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a long-term investment in the health of the U.S. economy. As Talha Faruqi, president of Aventure Aviation in Peachtree City, Georgia, says: â\\x80\\x9cNot only are small businesses the backbone of the US economy, but all the big companies that you see today were small businesses once.â\\x80\\x9d   To learn more about bipartisan policy solutions that will help small businesses, their employees, and their communities, visit the 10,000 Small Businesses Voices policy page.

       "  'content': 'As stock markets stumble, will the trillions of dollars that have flowed into private markets be a haven from the turmoil?  That question looms large as the market for assets that arenâ\\x80\\x99t publicly traded has roughly doubled in the past five years to about $10 trillion, according to data from consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and data provider Preqin. Private equity â\\x80\\x94 including leveraged buyouts and venture capital â\\x80\\x94 is the biggest chunk of that market, but it also includes infrastructure and private credit, and the money is flowing into everything from tech startups to buyouts to airports.  There are signs that fundraising has cooled slightly, but itâ\\x80\\x99s far from drying up. Globally for the first half of this year, the number of series-stage deals that are larger than $100 million has fallen 8% and the volume of capital raised through those deals has fallen 22% compared with 2021. This is still some 55% and 28% more than the five-year average, respectively, according to PitchBook, a data provider.  As the S&P 500 Index dips into a bear market, â\\x80\\x9cprivate markets arenâ\\x80\\x99t immune from the volatility,â\\x80\\x9d says Gaurav Mathur, Head of U.S. Equity Private Markets in the Investment Banking Division at Goldman Sachs. Much depends on the type of investor and the companyâ\\x80\\x99s stage of capital raising, though some reports suggest raising private capital is getting more difficult.    Hedge funds and mutual funds that invest in private and public markets have a bigger footprint among late-stage companies these days. These crossovers invested in deals representing 42% of aggregate value compared to an average of 24% over the prior decade, PitchBook data show. This indicates that part of the market is more correlated with public markets than it used to be.  Some of the capital has shifted to earlier- and mid-stage companies that have a longer timeline before they are expected to become a public company. And while hedge funds get many of the news headlines, pensions, sovereign wealth funds and family offices â\\x80\\x94 which may have a longer time horizon for investments â\\x80\\x94 are also a core part of the private-market ecosystem.  â\\x80\\x9cCompanies advancing the technological revolution can be financed by patient capital, though there is a heightened focus on valuation and timelines to important milestones,\" Mathur says.  As equity prices gyrate, interest has also grown in structured equity and structured credit (which has attributes of debt as well as equity). Some investors are more open to convertible notes, because, unlike pure equity, they are more debt-like securities and offer some downside protection if equity prices fall. For the executives who issue them, convertibles provide another option to finance the balance sheet in a volatile market. â\\x80\\x9cThe amount of money raised for structured securities has allowed issuers to access diverse pockets of capital,â\\x80\\x9d Mathur says.    Those options are available because of the amount of funds that have flowed into private markets from varying types of investors. The dry powder that investors have raised for private investments has soared nearly 40% since before the pandemic to a record $3.5 trillion, according to Preqin.  Another important change in private markets is that thereâ\\x80\\x99s a growing secondary market. That gives investors and employees more flexibility than they had before. â\\x80\\x9cThe market can observe where some companiesâ\\x80\\x99 shares are trading,â\\x80\\x9d Mathur says. â\\x80\\x9cYou couldnâ\\x80\\x99t do that as readily five years ago.â\\x80\\x9d'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The pandemic-induced housing boom appears to be cooling off.  From Toronto to Auckland, a slowdown in the housing market (the most interest-rate sensitive segment of the economy) is underway as interest rates in developed economies are set to climb rapidly, according to Goldman Sachs Research.  Mortgage rates spiked sharply since last summer in the U.K., Canada, New Zealand and U.S.; and given the likelihood of further rate hikes, borrowing costs for housing are likely to rise even further.     The housing picture in many of these countries shows a stark change underway, with already substantial declines in sales across developed economies. Home sales are down by 40% from their pandemic peak in the U.S., and by half in the U.K. Those declines in home sales are meaningful for prices in the near future because a 10 percentage point slowdown in house sales growth tends to be followed by a 2 percentage point slowdown in house price growth in around 6 months, Goldman Sachs Research estimates.  And while house prices are still rising in the likes of the U.S., Germany and the U.K., they are already declining across Australia, Canada, Sweden and New Zealand. In the latter, home prices are now 8% down from their peak during the pandemic. In Canada, house prices have fallen the most in areas that had the most growth early in the pandemic.    Goldman Sachs Research estimates that house prices will see a peak-to-trough decline of 12% in Canada, 9% in France and 3% in the U.S. over the next couple of years. The slowdown will be sharpest in Canada due to weak recent momentum, low affordability and rapid policy hikes by the Bank of Canada.     But housing affordability hasnâ\\x80\\x99t just been an issue in Canada. Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Housing Affordability Index, which captures the financial burden of taking a mortgage loan to buy a house, indicates affordability is low across most markets. Although it is especially low in Canada and New Zealand, the index has plunged by the most in the U.S. over the last year.    While the housing market has some headwinds, itâ\\x80\\x99s also notable that the supply of housing is especially tight in many geographies, including the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and New Zealand. From a longer-run demand perspective, the working-age population has grown quickly in recent years in Canada and steadily in the U.S., Sweden and France (though it has shrunk over the past year in Germany and Italy).  Taken together, there are strong signs that the surge in housing sales and prices during the pandemic has come to an end. Goldman Sachs Research expects growth in advanced economies to slow in coming quarters and the recent housing trends only reinforce that expectation. And while a tight housing market may be enough to avoid a slump, the rapid deterioration in affordability and large drops in home sales suggest that a housing downturn is a real risk.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Replay        Jaws dropped when the latest report on consumer price inflation arrived, clocking its biggest year-over-year jump in the U.S. since 1981. That and other economic data points contributed to the Federal Reserveâ\\x80\\x99s decision on June 15 to make its biggest rate hike since 1994. But there are signs that labor shortages â\\x80\\x94 a key driver of overall inflation, may have peaked months ago, according to Goldman Sachs Research.  The shortfall in workers may have peaked at â\\x80\\x9can extremely elevated levelâ\\x80\\x9d in March, according to Daan Struyven, co-leader of research on the global economy at Goldman Sachs in New York. Since then the jobs-workers gap â\\x80\\x94 which is the difference between the total number of jobs (in other words, employment plus job openings) and the total number of workers â\\x80\\x94 has started to edge down. Struyven says this metric is the best predictor of wage growth.  â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s very intuitive for capturing the balance of the bargaining power of workers versus employers,â\\x80\\x9d Struyven says. â\\x80\\x9cIf there are a lot of vacancies and very few people who are looking for a job, that suggests workers have the upper hand and bargaining power and that should put upward pressure on wage growth.â\\x80\\x9d    Wage growth is a critical part of overall inflation, and itâ\\x80\\x99s also the piece that the Fed can influence. While the central bank has little to no impact on global goods and commodity prices, the Fed is able to slow economic activity and employment growth by raising short-term interest rates and tightening financial conditions. The services sector is especially labor intensive, and wages are two-thirds of the cost structure in the U.S. economy. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s why itâ\\x80\\x99s intuitive that wages are a key driver of the outlook for inflation,â\\x80\\x9d Struyven says.  Economists at Goldman Sachs started paying closer attention to the jobs-workers gap in part because traditional measures of labor market tightness were out of synch with the surge in pay in the U.S. and other developed countries, Struyven says. The unemployment rate in the U.S., for example, is still slightly higher than it was before the pandemic (3.6% in May versus a low of 3.5% in 2019). Taken by itself, that rate would suggest the job market isnâ\\x80\\x99t overheated.    But red-hot wage increases tell another story. The jobs-workers gap shows that the American employment market is hovering around its tightest level since World War II. This measure has shown more statistical significance with wage growth and more accurate recent predictions than standard measures like the unemployment gap or the prime-age employment to population ratio, according to Goldman Sachs Research.  While shelter inflation has risen further, there are other measures that also suggest that the labor market and underlying inflation pressures have begun to moderate in the U.S. The unemployment rate has been stable for three months, and payroll growth has slowed from about 600,000 jobs per month during the winter to about 400,000 per month recently. Job vacancies fell in April, according to the Department of Laborâ\\x80\\x99s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). Alternative data suggests that job openings declined further in May and June.  Separately, there are signs that supply-chain bottlenecks, another key contributor to inflation, are easing; Goldman Sachs transportations analystsâ\\x80\\x99 supply chain congestion index has fallen to levels not seen since last summer.    There may be a number of reasons the jobs-workers gap has increased so much, including heavy fiscal spending as developed countries sought to counterbalance the disruption from the COVID pandemic as well as reduced immigration and a reduced labor force. The jobs-workers gap has risen in all Group of 10 advanced economies except Japan since the fourth quarter of 2019, says Struyven, a former economist at the World Bank.  The jobs-workers gap also helps economists understand why wage growth has been higher in the likes of the U.S. and U.K. â\\x80\\x94 where the gap has increased a great deal â\\x80\\x94 than in other advanced countries. English-speaking countries tended to have a stronger fiscal response to the pandemic, and they also had central bank policy rates before the pandemic that were above zero (unlike the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan), which likely gave their economies an extra boost when policy makers slashed interest rates.    Fed chair Jerome Powell is focused on the balance of labor, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s one of the reason why policy makers have hiked rates so aggressively. The central bank in Washington raised rates by 75 basis points this month after previously signaling that increases of 50 basis points were likely. Powell is also concerned about headline inflation and consumer expectations for price increases; as the Fed has become increasingly hawkish, Goldman Sachs Research now forecasts a 48% probability of recession during the next two years (up from an earlier forecast of 35%).  â\\x80\\x9cOne of the key takeaways from the last Fed meeting is that Powell and the Fed are willing to soften the labor market,â\\x80\\x9d Struyven said. â\\x80\\x9cThey donâ\\x80\\x99t want to generate a recession, but the priority is to bring inflation down. Once inflation expectations become unanchored you have high unemployment for a very long time.â\\x80\\x9d'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The euro area economy is starting to look more like the picture in the U.S. and the U.K. â\\x80\\x93 wage growth is accelerating and inflation seems to be getting stickier. Those concerns are pushing the European Central Bank to act faster to tighten monetary policy.  But as they get ready to leave behind nearly a decade of negative interest rates, government bond yields in parts of the continent have crept into the â\\x80\\x9cdanger zone,â\\x80\\x9d says Sven Jari Stehn, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs. As Italian government bond yields climb, officials in Frankfurt are assembling a new backstop for sovereign debt to make sure they can hike rates as needed to cool inflation.  We spoke with Stehn, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund, about how officials are likely to handle concerns about sovereign credit in southern Europe and his forecasts for ECB policy.  Last week the ECB had an emergency meeting as government bond yields in Italy jumped. Is this just the beginning of renewed fiscal stress in Europe or do you think the ECB can contain worries about sovereign stress in the eurozone?  The Governing Council came together on 15 June with an ad-hoc meeting to discuss market conditions, especially the rising sovereign yields. The ECB reiterated its commitment to avoid fragmentation risk, which is their language for non-fundamental sovereign stress in the euro area that risks undermining the smooth transmission of monetary policy. And I think there were two important conclusions from that meeting.  The first is that they decided to activate reinvestment flexibility for the pandemic asset holdings, which basically means that they can skew the reinvestment of maturing bonds across time and across countries to avoid fiscal stress that could interfere with the monetary policy normalisation.  And the second was a signal that they want to accelerate the completion of a new anti-fragmentation tool, which we expect them to announce at their July meeting.  These are important signals. We had looked for a backstop announcement to come, but itâ\\x80\\x99s come earlier than we anticipated and at lower yield levels than we would have thought.  The euro area still has a number of important risks related to the war in Ukraine, related to more fundamental economic issues. But we do think that this new tool and commitment that they have issued is going to be quite effective in anchoring sovereign credit in Europe to ensure that its monetary policy is transmitted across all parts of the euro area.   Youâ\\x80\\x99ve written that government bond yields in the likes of Italy have moved into the danger zone. What does that mean exactly?  Itâ\\x80\\x99s the level of bond yields where fiscal sustainability concerns could suddenly reappear and endanger the transmission of monetary policy. Debt sustainability depends on nominal growth, on interest rates and on fiscal policy. For now, high nominal growth helps. So youâ\\x80\\x99re seeing very strong tax revenues for example in Italy because the tax base has grown quite strongly. But we do expect nominal growth to slow as inflation comes down, and interest rates are expected to remain higher. So that means the path to reducing debt, particularly in Italy, has narrowed. Rises in bond yields, or shocks, from here can quite quickly become self-fulfilling. And thatâ\\x80\\x99s of course exactly what the ECB is trying to avoid.  This danger zone means that yields have moved up to levels where the risk of rising debt and fiscal stress has gone up. It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean itâ\\x80\\x99s inevitable, but we are in a place where these fiscal concerns could suddenly reappear and lead to a fragmentation of financing conditions for reasons that are unrelated to the fundamentals of the economy, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I think the ECB stepped up rhetoric this last week.    You expect the ECB to unveil a new tool at its July meeting. What do you think this instrument will entail and what is important about it?  We think it will have a number of key features. The most important is we think it will be unlimited in terms of size, essentially to maximize the announcement effect of this tool. And so it will be similar to the Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) program, which was launched during the sovereign debt crisis. And that was very helpful in reassuring markets via its big announcement effect.  If the program is unlimited, there needs to be conditionality as there was with OMT. For the new tool, we think itâ\\x80\\x99s more likely to be linked to the existing EU monitoring frameworkâ\\x80\\x94for example the Recovery Fund. So you have an existing surveillance system that we think the new instrument could make use of.  We also think the program is going to be flexible so that you can essentially buy bonds where the stresses are. That was one of the key insights from the pandemic quantitative easing program. We think the trigger point for activating purchases under the new backstop is going to be non-fundamental fragmentation riskâ\\x80\\x94so basically a sense that yields are moving rapidly away from levels that are consistent with fundamentals.  We donâ\\x80\\x99t think they will come out with a specific target for spreads. But itâ\\x80\\x99s going to be a more holistic assessment where the Governing Council makes the decision when yields and spreads are moving in an undesirable fashion, away from underlying fundamentals in a way that undermines monetary transmission.  Thereâ\\x80\\x99s still a number of open questionsâ\\x80\\x94what exactly the details will look likeâ\\x80\\x94but we think those are going to be the key parameters.   In combination with the measure announced last week, do you think this tool will be sufficient to keep sovereign credit worries from spreading so that the central bank can also deal with rising inflation? Or has the ECBâ\\x80\\x99s inflation-fighting goal been compromised?  Itâ\\x80\\x99s a difficult balancing act because on the one hand you need to tighten policy to cool inflation pressures, but on the other hand you need to make sure you avoid this fragmentation risk, which could undermine your efforts to get inflation down in an orderly fashion. Our take is that the tool is likely to be effective in anchoring sovereign credit and in protecting the hiking cycle.  The first line of defense is going to be the flexibility in pandemic asset holdings and only after that will they activate this broader backstop. The ECB will hope that the announcement effect here is strong enough that they donâ\\x80\\x99t need to actually use it, similar to OMT where you had a big announcement effect.  We think it will be effective in protecting the hiking cycle, and we think the Governing Council will start to hike in July by 25 basis points, and it will be 50 basis points in both September and October. We think the deposit rate will increase to 1.75% next year.  That said, itâ\\x80\\x99s important to keep in mind that a number of risks remain. Continued spill overs from the war in Ukraine via reduced gas supply are a risk. We have of course seen a sharp reduction in the gas supply over the past few weeks. Our base case remains for flows to improve again once the pipeline maintenance period is over in mid-July, but we have estimated that a complete cut of the Russian gas supply would push the euro area to recession, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s something that could reignite sovereign worries.  And then the second is around fundamental fragmentation riskâ\\x80\\x94in other words a real shift in economic fundamentals that implies real sovereign risk. And so here they key risk is the election of a populist leader somewhere in the euro area whose policies are at odds with debt sustainability. In that case, a fiscal solution would likely be required because the ECB has only committed to avoid non-fundamental fragmentation risk.  What is your view of the likelihood of recession in the eurozone and how do you analyze that?  Our baseline is that there will be pretty weak growth in the euro area for 2022. We basically have growth of about 1% at an annualized pace from the current quarter to the end of the year, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s slightly below trend. Weâ\\x80\\x99re below consensus in terms of the growth pace, but we donâ\\x80\\x99t have a recession as part of the base case because households are still sitting on quite a bit of excess savings. You have fiscal support and there is still room to grow in services, in tourism for example.  Those are the reasons we donâ\\x80\\x99t have a recession in our baseline, but recession risk is certainly elevated in Europe.  How does the potential for reduced gas supply feed into recession worries for the euro area?  Itâ\\x80\\x99s the key near-term recession risk because the euro area is highly dependent on Russian gas supplies, particularly in Germany and Italy. We have seen already a significant reduction in gas flows from Russia and estimate that a complete ban of Russian gas supply would lower growth in the euro area by more than 2 percentage points this year, and the hit would be significantly larger than that in Italy and Germany.  A discontinuation of the gas flows from Russia would likely push the euro area into recession pretty quickly because the euro area is highly dependent on it and itâ\\x80\\x99s quite hard to substitute away from gas.  Inflation is rising just about everywhere. What is your take on the inflation picture in Europe right now?  You have headline inflation of 8% to 9% in the U.S., U.K. and euro area, and the numbers here have continued to surprise on the upside. Now, the euro area inflation picture has been different from other countries in a number of respects. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a higher energy contribution in Europe; itâ\\x80\\x99s about twice as large as in the U.S. Core inflation and wage growth so far have been weaker, which has basically been because the labor market is less overheated than for example in the U.S.  But the euro area inflation picture has started to look more like the U.S. and U.K. If you look at core inflation over the last six months, itâ\\x80\\x99s been running essentially at the same level. Inflation expectations have been rising and wage growth has stated to accelerate. Itâ\\x80\\x99s still below U.S. and U.K. levels, but we do think itâ\\x80\\x99s going to rise further from here.  The bottom line is that inflation is also likely to remain above 2 percent for the next two to three years, and that does mean thereâ\\x80\\x99s more urgency for the ECB to act. That said, the underlying inflation pressures for Europe are still lower and so we think the ECB doesnâ\\x80\\x99t need to hurry quite as much as the Fed.  But, with the latest data, there has been some evolution of the euro area looking a bit more like the U.S.'},\n",

Zhestkova says that the shocks are concerning for emerging markets, which are more susceptible to threats on food security. Here, a high proportion of consumer income is spent on food, so even a marginal increase in food inflation might hit households in these regions particularly hard.  â\\x80\\x9cFood inflation is definitely being felt in a lot of countries in the CEEMEA region, like Turkey, but also in eastern Europe, in nations including Romania, Poland and Hungary. All of them are enduring meaningful surprises to the upside,â\\x80\\x9d Zhestkova explained. â\\x80\\x9cWe have also seen a significant surge in prices in the big LATAM countries, like Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.â\\x80\\x9d    Before the war in Ukraine, food inflation was increasing worldwide. Now the conflict is compounding the crisis. According to Goldman Sachs research, Ukraine and Russia account for more than 20% of global wheat and oilseed production. This has been disrupted by the war, with the combined dry bulk shipping activity from the region dropping by 40% compared with the 2021 average.  â\\x80\\x9cMarch and April are when farmers are going to the fields and working on their summer harvests,â\\x80\\x9d Zhestkova says. â\\x80\\x9cFor the first two months of war we havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen any grain shipments coming from Ukraine, and although Ukraine has managed to return about 15-20% of exporting capacity since, the lack of fertilizers and general disruptions are hitting Ukraineâ\\x80\\x99s grain harvest now and will drag the crisis on into the next year.â\\x80\\x9d  As a result, many of the countries already feeling the impact of surging food costs are now feeling the effects of the conflict in Ukraine. Those nations that import soft commodities from Ukraine and Russia are the most obviously affected, according to Zhestkova, and alongside European neighboring states, these include large CEEMEA countries such as Turkey and Egypt, and in Africa, Nigeria and Sudan.  Countries in South America are also feeling the effects â\\x80\\x94 albeit in a different way. Countries here are impacted primarily through inputs of agriculture production. â\\x80\\x9cThere has been a slow decline of fertilizer exports from eastern Europe,â\\x80\\x9d Zhestkova says. â\\x80\\x9cThe price of fertilizers has increased 2.5 times since May 2019. Though this is the first year when the farmers are dealing with such extraordinarily high prices, and a contributing factor is that LATAM farmers rely on fertilizers produced in Russia and Belarus.â\\x80\\x9d  Zhestkova believes the full effects on food prices from the war in Ukraine are yet to be felt. â\\x80\\x9cI think most of the impact is still in the pipeline,â\\x80\\x9d she concludes. â\\x80\\x9cLow harvests, problems with supply chain distribution, and elevated input prices across the world were putting pressure on global food inflation to the upside. We now have added pressure on supply because there is a loss from the unharvested fields in Ukraine.â\\x80\\x9d'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The biggest gap between job openings and available workers in postwar history is one of the key reasons that inflation is soaring in the U.S. A drop in immigration has helped push the gap wider, suggesting an increase in foreign-born workers could help contain the rise in wages and prices, according to Goldman Sachs Research.  As pandemic restrictions were lifted, labor demand recovered much more quickly than the labor force itself. As a result, wages jumped 5.5% during the past year, according to Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Wage Tracker. If this pace continues, the Federal Reserve would have a difficult time achieving its longer-run inflation goal of 2%. Labor participation is expected to pick up in the U.S., adding as many as 1.5 million workers over the coming year, but economists at Goldman Sachs predict that will leave a sizable jobs-workers gap of around 1 million.    Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently noted that the drop in foreign-born workers coming to the U.S. has rippled through the employment market. Immigration slowed in the U.S. between 2019 and 2021 amid the spread of COVID-19 and policy changes, leaving the labor force about 1.6 million workers smaller than it would have been if it had stayed on its pre-pandemic trend. And while green card issuance and temporary work visas have rebounded recently to roughly their previous levels, immigration rates would need to increase even more to make up for the shortfall, Goldman Sachs Research shows.  The COVID health crisis was part of the reason for the decline in immigration, but Trump administration policies, from visa bans to lower caps on refugees, also played a part. Under the new administration, the pace of immigration into the U.S. appears to have returned to what it was before the pandemic, according to Goldman Sachs Research, as temporary visas and green card issuance have rebounded, and the cap on refugees has been lifted. But even so, the population of foreign-born workers is smaller than it would have been without policy changes and the pandemic, and Congressional Budget Office estimates indicate the shortfall could increase.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s difficult to catch up because U.S. immigration law has numerical limits on many categories of visas. Broad bipartisan immigration reform appears out of reach, but smaller changes may have a chance, such as a bill for farm workers or other temporary jobs.    The Biden administration has some options that could increase immigration without approval from Congress, such as clearing the administrative backlog of interviews for visas (by waiving those interviews, for example), redeploying unused visas from previous years and allowing family members of certain types of visa holders to work.  Immigration is a top political concern in the U.S., but so is inflation. To get price increases back to the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s 2% target, the jobs-workers gap in the U.S. needs to narrow by around 2.5 million, according to Goldman Sachs Research, and the expected increase in labor-force participation is well short of what appears to be required. It may be realistic to boost annual immigration by a few hundred thousand people â\\x80\\x94 making a modest dent in the shortfall â\\x80\\x94 but not by enough to close it.  When it comes to cooling the labor market, this suggests the Federal Reserve will have to do the heavy lifting by raising interest rates enough to slow the economy.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The economy based on physical stuff is getting its revenge.  Not so long ago, investors were enamored with fast-growing companies that used software to send a ride or groceries to your door at the push of button, even if the firmâ\\x80\\x99s profits were far off in the horizon. But these days, healthy margins and companies that make real, physical stuff are back in focus, according to Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs.  â\\x80\\x9cWe are seeing it quite quickly,â\\x80\\x9d Oppenheimer says of the shift, which is filtering through equity markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has fallen nearly 30% this year, whereas the U.K.â\\x80\\x99s FTSE 100 Index, a benchmark tilted toward heavy industry and commodities, is roughly unchanged. Unprofitable tech companies have fallen about 50%, according to a custom Goldman Sachs index.    â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a reminder that weâ\\x80\\x99re still living in a very human, physical world,â\\x80\\x9d Oppenheimer says. â\\x80\\x9cThe value of those physical things, including human capital, is actually going up.â\\x80\\x9d  That shift is part of what Oppenheimer, who is also the head of Macro Research in Europe, calls the â\\x80\\x9cpostmodern cycle.â\\x80\\x9d In this phase, interest rates are climbing from subterranean levels; instead of tepid price increases, inflation is a renewed risk; executives are grappling with a jump in commodity prices and workers with bargaining power as some aspects of globalization are reset; and governments are likely to grow larger and flex their muscles more often.    The cost of labor, capital and energy are rising as forces that had been in place since the end of the Cold War are changing, according to Goldman Sachs Research. The geopolitics of that period were relatively stable, and globalization was on the rise as India and China joined the World Trade Organization. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker snapped a wage-price spiral in the 1970s and independent central banks made inflation targeting a core mission â\\x80\\x94 giving way to a long period of declining rates and lower inflation. Taxes fell in many places and some governments set about deregulating various industries.  â\\x80\\x9cAll of these things resulted in longer and more stable, less volatile, economic and financial cycles,â\\x80\\x9d Oppenheimer says. But those drivers may not persist in a world where itâ\\x80\\x99s estimated that $6 trillion of annual investment is needed for green energy to reduce climate change. Smaller government, lower taxes and less regulation are â\\x80\\x9cbeing challenged for all kinds of reasons,â\\x80\\x9d he says.    As inflation â\\x80\\x94 and, subsequently, borrowing costs â\\x80\\x94 rises, Oppenheimer expects shorter and more volatile economic and financial cycles. Financial assets (bonds as well as stocks) rose as rates over the decades fell â\\x80\\x94 but returns are likely to be lower now that the reverse is happening, Oppenheimer says. One upshot is that stock pickers may have a better chance against index funds.    But capital is also becoming more expensive as interest rates rise. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s more demand for capital relative to the amount of savings, and risk premiums are likely to climb because there are more uncertainties and the risk-free rate (Treasury yields) has risen.  â\\x80\\x9cVery, very cheap capital has been one of the drivers of the growth of newer companies, which have managed to fund themselves at extremely cheap rates for a long time,â\\x80\\x9d Oppenheimer says. The rising cost of capital can be painful when it causes valuations to adjust, but it can also result in healthier, more sustainable companies.    That isnâ\\x80\\x99t to suggest that none of these tech and software firms are good companies, Oppenheimer says. â\\x80\\x9cSome of them will no doubt recover and be some of the great growth leaders of the future,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s just that they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t justify the valuations.â\\x80\\x9d  And whereas the modern economy featured rapidly growing world trade that resulted in better profits for companies but pressure on wages for workers in wealthy countries, the postmodern cycle may see the reverse, Oppenheimer says. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have exposed the frailties of just-in-time inventories, which is likely to result in some manufacturing and supply chains moving back from abroad, a trend that Oppenheimer says supports a tighter labor market and higher prices for goods and commodities.    A scarcity of labor and commodities, meanwhile, is poised to spur investment in efficiency and productivity. â\\x80\\x9cOne of the conundrums of the last decade or so is thatâ\\x80\\x99s thereâ\\x80\\x99s been quite poor productivity growth despite a lot of technological innovation,â\\x80\\x9d Oppenheimer says. â\\x80\\x9cHigher income costs should encourage much more investment and innovation in efficiencies: becoming more energy efficient, for example, and the substitution of technology for labor â\\x80\\x94 things like robotics.â\\x80\\x9d  And that fits in with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s expectation for higher capital expenditures. In the past decade or so, traditional capital spending was in decline as economic growth was weak and many industries had lots of extra capacity. â\\x80\\x9cThe growing demand for spending on decarbonization and defense budgets as well as an incentive for investment in energy- and labor-savings technologies will trigger more capital spending,â\\x80\\x9d Oppenheimer says.    Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a risk, of course, that the world tips back into the old paradigm of slow growth and feeble inflation and interest rates â\\x80\\x94 what some have called â\\x80\\x9csecular stagnation.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf that were to happen, you might go back to the patterns we were seeing before the pandemic,â\\x80\\x9d Oppenheimer says. â\\x80\\x9cBut even so I think that other things are shifting: the geopolitics, the move to decarbonization. These are all longer-term developments that are distinct to what we were seeing pre-pandemic.  â\\x80\\x9cEven if inflation starts to come down and interest rates peak soon,â\\x80\\x9d he adds, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think weâ\\x80\\x99re going back into a world where weâ\\x80\\x99re getting continued declines in interest rates.â\\x80\\x9d     Read the full report here.       09 MAY 2022 Goldman Sachs Research The Postmodern Cycle Read Report'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The S&P 500 Index this year has fallen by the most in decades, as investors reckon with everything from lockdowns in China to a Federal Reserve that aims to cool the most overheated job market in postwar U.S. history.  But retail investors, who have become a key force in U.S. equities, have for the most part kept their cool, according to Scott Rubner, a managing director in the Global Markets Division at Goldman Sachs. For every $100 thatâ\\x80\\x99s gone into stock funds during the past 74 weeks, only $2 has flowed out. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the opposite of professional investors, he says, most of whom have already exited the market.  Money moved out of just about every type of fund last week, including those that invest in stocks, bonds, gold and money markets; technology-stock funds had the largest redemptions of the year. We spoke with Rubner, an expert on fund flows who is on the derivatives sales and macro execution team in New York, about whether the COVID-era flood of money into these funds is starting to reverse, and what that means for the S&P 500 Index of U.S. stocks and other assets.   You recently wrote in a note to clients that, for every $100 put in stock-market mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over this cycle, only $2 has been redeemed. Is that retail investing or a mix of institutional and households?  Most people who are trading these products are retail. That jibes with the concept that retail and households are the largest owner of the equity market.  What is your takeaway from these numbers?  The general view is that the largest pool of capital gets panicky when the market reaches its lows. But what this is saying is that thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of money thatâ\\x80\\x99s flocked into the equity market and itâ\\x80\\x99s not come out. I donâ\\x80\\x99t expect it to come out.  I only expect it to come out if the market were to materially move lower from current levels, and I view that as down 10%. A way to calculate that is by looking at the average level for the S&P 500 when this investment was flowing in, and then calculate a 10% drop from that average. And down 10% from the average in S&P-equivalent terms is about 3,800. The market is up materially from that level, at about 4,088.  Who could sell from here? The only person who hasnâ\\x80\\x99t sold is households. Everybody else on the professional investor side has sold, is short or has no more to sell. And if retail doesnâ\\x80\\x99t sell from here â\\x80\\x94 because the market has held in at some of the key levels â\\x80\\x94 I donâ\\x80\\x99t see the market crashing.      Some of the measures of liquidity that you look at have never been worse. How much is that contributing to the selloff and whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on under the surface?  The drop in liquidity exacerbates the selloff. And liquidity has declined in part because the people who provide liquidity have drastically changed. Now itâ\\x80\\x99s a more quantitative liquidity provider who is very fast and sophisticated â\\x80\\x94 they giveth and they taketh away quickly and suddenly.  At the same time, Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Financial Conditions Index has substantially tightened, and the Fed is withdrawing liquidity hand over fist at this juncture.  People were used to buying in a market that went up every single day for the COVID era, and a lot of those traders are new to the equity market. If you withdraw liquidity and start seeing redemptions, you could open up some downside on, specifically, some non-profitable tech companies.  You pointed out to clients that for every $1 invested in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, 22 cents of that is concentrated in the five biggest companies in the fund. For Invescoâ\\x80\\x99s QQQ ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, 42 cents of every $1 dollar is concentrated in the five biggest stocks. What is your takeaway from those figures?  The market has had a robust period of inflows over 74 weeks. That money mostly went into U.S. products â\\x80\\x94 S&P 500 and Nasdaq. And by buying passive ETFs you are buying those top five stocks â\\x80\\x94 the big tech companies. That by definition is the largest and most-owned place that investors had been hiding. And that is also the worldâ\\x80\\x99s 401(k) portfolio.   These things basically went a year and a half without redemptions. But now redemptions are starting to pick up. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll know that retail stock investors are starting to capitulate when those big tech companies tumble in price.  Is there more trading in ETFs than in single stocks? Does that matter?  Last week on one particularly volatile day, ETFs represented 45% of the overall tape in the U.S. This is not normal. To me, that suggests that it is macro and long-short hedge funds and professional investors hedging around liquid macro products and not trading the underlying.  If you get tapped on the should by your risk manager and they say, â\\x80\\x9chey, you need to reduce the portfolio,â\\x80\\x9d then the way you do that is you walk in and you short futures and you short the big ETFs. That isnâ\\x80\\x99t fundamental investing â\\x80\\x94 thatâ\\x80\\x99s risk management and itâ\\x80\\x99s not sustainable. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve never seen stats like that.  For the market structure to heal, it needs for ETFs to be a lower percentage of volume and more fundamental trading where we can get true price discovery.

       "  'content': 'The Federal Reserve is tapping the brakes on U.S. economic growth, which could help bring down inflation and temper the most overheated job market in postwar American history, according to Goldman Sachs Research.  As inflation surges, the U.S. central bank has taken a more hawkish stance this year. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s part of the reason Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Financial Conditions Index has tightened by about 100 basis points since April, which is forecast to be enough to reduce the growth in gross domestic product by about 1 percentage point. Goldman Sachs Research now expects U.S. economic growth of 2.4% this year on an annual basis (versus 2.6% previously) and 1.6% in 2023 (versus 2.2%).  â\\x80\\x9cWe now think the rate hikes that are currently priced into financial conditions are in the ballpark of what is ultimately needed to restore balance to the labor market and cool wage and price pressures,â\\x80\\x9d Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a report on May 15. The Fed has raised its funds rate twice this year and is currently targeting a range of 0.75% to 1%. Goldman Sachs economists expect that rate to reach 2.5% to 2.75% in 2022 and a range of 3% to 3.25% the following year.  The slowdown in economic growth is likely to lower job openings and, eventually, increase the unemployment rate a bit, as openings typically only decline when the jobless rate spikes during a recession.  Even so, economists at Goldman Sachs are optimistic that a sharp increase in unemployment can be avoided: job openings fall more, and the jobless rate less, when openings are high â\\x80\\x94 as they are now. In addition, the overshoot in openings is focused in industries where openings tend to be more sensitive to a tightening in the Financial Conditions Index.    The sheer momentum in the U.S. job market is forecasted to push the unemployment rate down to 3.4% in the coming months, compared with 3.6% in April, according to Goldman Sachs Research. That rate is expected to increase to 3.5% by the end of this year and to 3.7% by the end of 2023.  The Fed isnâ\\x80\\x99t the only reason the job market is expected to cool. The labor supply is forecast to increase because of the end of unemployment insurance benefits and other fiscal transfers and as COVID-related health concerns fade.  Those factors are expected to increase the labor supply by as much as 1.5 million in the next year, helping close the current jobs-workers gap of about 5.6 million. There are also tentative signs that increases in wages and prices are decelerating â\\x80\\x94 all of which could help Fed policy makers achieve their inflation target of 2%.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 12 May 2022       Like many countries, Brazil faces a challenging mix of slowing economic growth and soaring inflation. But what makes Latin Americaâ\\x80\\x99s largest economy different from other nations is that its central bank has lifted its benchmark rate 10-straight times to one of the highest policy rates in the world.  Such high interest rates mean that tight financial conditions and sluggish economic growth are among the key challenges for Brazil, which is gearing up for a presidential election later this year, according to Alberto Ramos, head of Latin American Economic Research at Goldman Sachs. We spoke with the former senior economist at the International Monetary Fund about the risk of stagflation in Brazil and what he plans to explore on May 16 at Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Brazil Macro Conference in São Paulo that will host many of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s most influential policy makers.  What is the biggest challenge for Brazil right now?  Now that the pandemic has mostly moved into the rearview mirror, Brazil continues to face the endemic issues of low investment, low productivity, low growth. Perhaps the most notable aspect of Brazil is that it continues to underwhelm on the growth front. Excluding 2021 â\\x80\\x94 when growth rebounded from the sharp contraction in 2020 â\\x80\\x94 the last time Brazil grew more than 3% was 12 years ago, and granted 3% is not a particularly impressive number.  That is the main macro challenge: to fix the broken engine of growth to deliver faster, more inclusive growth and, at the same time, to overcome perennial fiscal vulnerabilities which in and of themselves are undermining the growth dynamics. Investment spending has been notoriously low in Brazil as a share of GDP. So the big challenge for whoever gets to govern the country next year is to accelerate investment and growth. Slow social and economic progress for many years and diminished expectations with regards to the future generate social and political pressure and weaken governability. That is one of the key issues that comes up repeatedly in discussions with investors.    How high are the risks of stagflation and recession for Brazil?   Stagflation is no longer a risk â\\x80\\x94 itâ\\x80\\x99s a reality. Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s inflation has been high, and growth, which has been mediocre since the second quarter of 2021, is expected to remain weak throughout 2022. The risk of a recession is significant, particularly in the second half of the year given the tightness of financial conditions. And as you exhaust the gains from the reopening of the economy post-COVID, we may see growth at the margin approaching zero and eventually dipping into negative territory.  Why are inflation and interest rates so high in Brazil relative to the rest of the world and even other parts of Latin America?   This is not the happiest of times in Brazil for a number of reasons. Inflation is very high, itâ\\x80\\x99s in double digits and highly disseminated, the growth outlook is rather modest and monetary policy is very restrictive.  Why is inflation so high in Brazil? Itâ\\x80\\x99s a combination of domestic and external factors. The external factors are related to high commodity prices and rising input and logistical costs. On the domestic side there are two things that are idiosyncratic to the Brazilian story on inflation. One is related to the electricity sector and a drought that led to very significant hikes in electricity tariffs because of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s reliance on hydroelectric power. The second one is that the currency was for a long time significantly dislocated. Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s real was much cheaper than our theoretical fair value models, and that was a reflection of the significant fiscal risk premia â\\x80\\x94 concerns about the medium-term sustainability of the public finances â\\x80\\x94 and political and policy uncertainty. The undervalued currency amplified the commodity price shock.  So when you combine the global factors that have pressured inflation everywhere â\\x80\\x94 imported inflation â\\x80\\x94 amplified by the shock to electricity tariffs due to the drought and the undervaluation of the currency, that explains why inflation in Brazil is already in double digits and higher than peers across LatAm. And in response to that, the central bank has already hiked the policy rate a lot and theyâ\\x80\\x99re not yet done, but in our assessment theyâ\\x80\\x99re close to it. I think weâ\\x80\\x99re now in the late-cycle fine-tuning stage.  How has the surge in commodity prices amid the war in Ukraine played out for the Latin American economies like Brazil that are big commodity producers?      Higher commodity prices are a positive development for these commodity exporters. The problem is that high commodity prices amplify already significant inflationary pressures and will lead to even tighter monetary policy. So financial conditions are going to tighten more because of the surge in commodity prices.  On the one hand the windfall income from higher commodity prices will grease the wheels of activity, but on the other hand inflation will accelerate further and rates will go even higher and that undermines growth. So net-net, it really depends on the mix of commodities that particular countries export and how serious are the inflation dynamics and the policy response to it.  In addition, you have to factor in that whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on in Europe is also leading to downward revisions to global growth and trade, particularly in Europe but globally in general, and is generating logistical and supply-chain disruptions. That further dampens the already lackluster growth outlook.   There are many headlines right now about central banks from Sweden to the U.S. raising interest rates. Where is Brazil in that constellation of polices?  Brazil has probably one of the most mature and advanced monetary cycles. The policy rate was pushed way too low during the second half of 2020 to last â\\x80\\x94 it was pushed to 2% and thatâ\\x80\\x99s one of the reasons why the currency didnâ\\x80\\x99t trade well throughout most of 2021. The interest-carry was way too low. But then they were steadfast in swiftly pushing the policy rate from 2% to close to 13%. That is admittedly a very steep monetary cycle.  While Brazil is now in the late-cycle fine-tuning iterations, the Fed is starting its own cycle at a time when monetary policy in Brazil is already quite tight. Name one other country on this planet where the ex-ante real rate is 7% and is facing a very modest growth profile. It goes without saying this is not sustainable: youâ\\x80\\x99ve canâ\\x80\\x99t maintain real rates of 7% for a long period of time.  So ideally when the inflation dynamics allow you to do it, the central bank should be cutting rates. The problem is, can you actually be cutting rates in a significant way when the Fed is hiking?  I think the central bank will be able to cut rates somewhat in 2023, but global monetary conditions and the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s hiking will limit the policy room to ease. So most likely Brazil will be living for a few years with a restricted monetary policy. Part of that reflects their own inflation reality â\\x80\\x94we also expect inflation to be downward sticky due to inertial forces â\\x80\\x94 and a global backdrop of higher core rates.  Is there anything youâ\\x80\\x99re especially excited to explore at Goldmanâ\\x80\\x99s upcoming conference?   Itâ\\x80\\x99s always a high-profile event that brings together a vast array of senior policy makers, high-profile political figures, local and international pundits, senior investors and many macro analysts from Goldman Sachs Research. Itâ\\x80\\x99s really a unique opportunity for both domestic and foreign investors that travel to Brazil on this occasion to, in one day, have a top-down 360-degree view on all things Brazil.  For this yearâ\\x80\\x99s conference, the political moment and outlook will certainly be top of mind. Getting more clarity about the election dynamics â\\x80\\x94 presidential and legislative elections will take place later in the year â\\x80\\x94 and what is the vision of the most competitive candidates for Brazil. Furthermore, other key issues for debate and discussion will be the medium-term fiscal outlook and strategy and the near-term macro monetary policy strategy to put the inflation genie back in the bottle.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Recent instances of threatened energy supply have the potential to galvanize investors, corporates and policymakers to prioritize green energy sources that are also secure, reliable, and accessible. To achieve this, significant capital investment will need to be deployed globally â\\x80\\x94 to the tune of $6 trillion year. We talked with Brian Singer, global head of GS SUSTAIN, to understand more about Green Capex, which industries will feel the effects, which technologies hold the most potential, and where policy can help to drive investment.   To set the scene, what are we talking about when we us the term â\\x80\\x9cGreen Capexâ\\x80\\x9d?   Green Capex describes the capital investment needed to decarbonize the world, address water needs and shore up transportation and other critical infrastructure. We believe it will be the dominant driver of global infrastructure over the next decade, requiring $6 trillion deployed annually to meet these goals. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s clearly a very substantial increase from the $3.2 trillion per year invested from 2016 to 2020, and the incremental $2.8 trillion need represents around 2.7% of global gross domestic product, so thereâ\\x80\\x99s a major opportunity for Green Capex to become a critical secular theme.   Why are we talking about Green Capex now?  There are several reasons. Very clearly, at the highest level there is a climate imperative, for which the United Nations has outlined various net zero, clean water, and infrastructure-related sustainable development goals. More recently, energy reliability has been an issue as well. Even before the war in Ukraine, there were multiple instances where supply was threatened or cut entirely â\\x80\\x94 in China, in Europe, in Texas, in California â\\x80\\x94 all of which are developed global economies.  We think this backdrop is pushing a shift in mindset from aspiration to action. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not enough to just have clean energy: It needs to be secure, it needs to be reliable, and it needs to be accessible.  As investor priorities shift, which industries will come into focus?  One of the big points we continue to make is there's a broader supply chain that's needed to ensure the success of decarbonization, develop green infrastructure and guarantee clean water. It's not just in the technologies and the verticals of the final product â\\x80\\x94 there are lots of sectors needed to support the parts and services.  For example, when it comes to solar, wind, and electric vehicles, itâ\\x80\\x99s not just the panels or cars themselves but includes:   The supply chain of goods and services needed to deliver these products such as engineering and construction building out the infrastructure  New innovations in automation that provide software and hardware opportunities  Scaling up and lowering the cost of battery storage and hydrogen  Deploying energy efficient products more widely such as in as zero carbon buildings   But thatâ\\x80\\x99s not all. Most ESG funds are extraordinarily overweight versus their benchmarks across solar, wind and water. We see an opportunity more broadly, particularly in sectors of the supply chain where near-term investment is critical because investments come with long lead times: between two- and 12-year horizons. We call these â\\x80\\x9cGreenablers.â\\x80\\x9d  This space includes infrastructure companies refurbishing and building out electricity grids; cybersecurity companies keeping networks reliable; metals companies producing needed copper and aluminum; and semiconductor companies reducing the energy intensity needed to power our demand for data and automation. These sectors don't necessarily get thought of as much or as consistently as green, but are vital to ensuring clean energy security, reliability, and accessibility.   Which technologies will be particularly vital targets for Green Capex and R&D?   The path to net zero will require breakthroughs across multiple green technologies. Put plainly, decarbonizing certain emissions â\\x80\\x94 like those generated by industrial processes or long-haul transport â\\x80\\x94 require solutions that are relatively new and still very expensive.  Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why significant and swift green capex is so necessary. If we can start to unlock scale â\\x80\\x94 and in so doing reduce costs â\\x80\\x94 across an ecosystem of seven critical technologies, it could provide transformational and disruptive solutions to drive decarbonization in the longer-term.    To what extent is Green Capex a regional question?   According to our Energy and Utilities research teams, meeting Net Zero objectives will likely require total capital and investment of about $11 trillion in the EU by 2050 and $16 trillion in China by 2060.  A recent Princeton University report highlighted the need for at least $2.5 trillion of incremental cumulative spending during 2021-2030 for the U.S. to stay on track to meet net zero emissions.  Where will the funding for Green Capex come from?  First, itâ\\x80\\x99s important to note that while weâ\\x80\\x99ve highlighted a need to increase annual investment needed for us to reach those key U.N. goals by $2.8 trillion, not all of that is on track today.  The good news is that we see a significant opportunity for public companies to be investing more. Recently theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been investing lower and lower percentages of their operating cash flow back into capex and R&D, but that means, as a result, we think publicly traded companies have spare capacity to spend about $1 trillion more per year in Green Capex, within free cash flow and without straining balance sheets.  That doesnâ\\x80\\x99t make all the math work, but it gets us part of the way. Importantly, for investors to support these investments, companies will need to demonstrate a clear return on their investments. For some sectors and companies, this may warrant a combination of higher product prices, lower costs via innovation, and policy support.  Given this context, to what extent can policy be a Greenabler?   A great example of where policy is a Greenabler is in encouraging carbon capture. As my colleague Michele Della Vigna has said, we believe that carbon capture can take care of somewhere between 10% and 15% of global emissions, especially from heavy industries that are tough to decarbonize. Not only does the technology exist, but it has for years. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve just never developed it in a standardized large-scale way, of the sort that drives down costs.   Things like financial incentives and tax treatments â\\x80\\x94 policy â\\x80\\x94 can change that. In the United States, there's the 45Q tax credit that is out there now, and it's already started conversations between the industrial emitters themselves, firms that can transport CO2, those that have sequestration expertise, and landowners.   Generally speaking, clarity on the extent and mechanics of government support for Green Capex and consumer incentives will help to drive greater corporate and consumer engagement.   Regulatory classification systems such as the introduction of the new E.U. Taxonomy for sustainable activities could help companies and investors understand how much Green Capex companies are investing, particularly companies that have diversified business lines.       11 October 2021 Goldman Sachs Research Green Capex: Making Infrastructure Happen Read Report\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 05 May 2022       Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s digital champions have been buffeted by uncertainty on three fronts: COVID-19 measures, regulatory tightening and the risk of delisting from US stock markets. We sat down with Ronald Keung, the head of Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Asia internet team to discuss the recovery of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s internet sector following a period of weaker earnings. Looking beyond the near-term COVID impact, Keung says that the outlook remains promising for investors.  Strict containment measures have been imposed in Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s tech hubs, including Shanghai. How have these restrictions impacted the internet sector? Do you expect an increase in online spending?   When containment measures were first rolled out in Wuhan in 2020, we saw a significant shift online across multiple verticals in China. The temporary closure of physical stores was positive for many players and Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s online population surged. This time around, while we think that restrictions are likely to increase time spent on games and online videos, consumption started on a weaker note this year, and people are spending more on staples rather than on clothes and other discretionary items. Local governments in China are issuing coupons to boost consumer confidence and ramp up spending in the second quarter. The upcoming â\\x80\\x9c6.18â\\x80\\x9d shopping festival in China, that spans from June 1st-18th, will be a key event to gauge the impact of consumption stimulus across big-ticket items.  Another factor is that the containment measures have caused disruption to supply chains, but e-commerce companies are working closely with the government to restart their operations. To put this into perspective, in the first week of April, when containment measures were introduced in Shanghai, one of the biggest e-commerce companies operated at 20% of their average daily handling capacity. In the fourth week of April, their handling capacity bounced back to around 80%.  Looking beyond the near-term COVID impact, what are the future growth drivers in this sector?     The medium-to-long-term outlook remains promising for investors, and weâ\\x80\\x99ve forecast China's e-commerce market to reach US$2.7 trillion by 2025 from US$1.7 trillion in 2021. Firstly, we expect solid growth from China's internet verticals with lower online penetration. Some of the major platforms have already tapped most of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s internet users. For instance, online penetration for Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s advertising and games industries is already at nearly 80%. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why we think the key growth opportunities ahead are in the underpenetrated categories, like fresh food, pharmaceutical services and to-Business opportunities, including enterprise I.T. spending on cloud and logistics supply chain services. Secondly, we see internationalization as a key growth driver. Various platforms are tapping into the opportunities outside of China, with expansion into South East Asia and Latin America.   China's internet share prices have underperformed their U.S. peers over the past year. Do you expect this to change?  Weaker earnings momentum and concerns over macro weakness and regulations were the main reasons that Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s internet sector underperformed their U.S. peers over the past year. But we expect to see a recovery of earnings towards the second half of this year. There are long-term winners in this space that have built high enough moats around their businesses and have multiple growth drivers beyond their core business. Those with strong balance sheets and cash positions could drive further buybacks or even start to pay dividends.  Last year the Chinese government tightened regulations on tech companies. How is the internet sector faring?  2021 was a year of new regulations focused on driving long-term health and fairer competition in China's internet industry. This year, many of those regulations will go into effect. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll gain more clarity as this progresses, but recent signals have been positive. Last month, the Politburo, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s top decision-making body, stated its plans to complete targeted inspections of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s internet platforms and launch measures that aim to support regulated healthy development of the sector.  There are a few key regulatory developments that weâ\\x80\\x99re watching this year. Firstly, weâ\\x80\\x99re expecting continued oversight and guidance from Chinese authorities on platform business take rates. There are plans to set a cap on the percentage that ride-hailing platforms can take from driversâ\\x80\\x99 fees, as well as guidance to lower online food delivery platforms' delivery service fees during COVID periods.  Secondly, in July last year, the Cyberspace Administration of China launched a probe into a few U.S. listed firms as part of its focus on data security and weâ\\x80\\x99re awaiting the conclusion. Finally, weâ\\x80\\x99ll be looking for any progress on US-China audit inspection. Currently, Chinese companies traded in the U.S. arenâ\\x80\\x99t audited by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a U.S. audit regulator. Chinese regulatory authorities are hopeful that an agreement can be reached with the PCAOB and weâ\\x80\\x99ll be watching out for progress.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'Asian Americans are a tremendous contributor to the U.S. economy, with an outsized presence in everything from sophisticated patents to Nobel Prizes. But as the U.S. marks Asian Heritage Month, Goldman Sachs Research finds that this group still faces barriers in rising to the highest echelons of corporate America.  Asian Americans are the most highly educated group in the U.S. and have had marked success in terms of income and innovation: Despite only accounting for 6% of the population, Asian Americans represent 13% of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) jobs and were behind 19% of high-impact patents, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Since 1980, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve won one-out-of-10 Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry. Asian Americans are over-represented in fast growing industries like information, corporate management and professional technical services.    But there are signs that what author Jane Hyun called the â\\x80\\x9cbamboo ceilingâ\\x80\\x9d in 2005 is still there. While accounting for 13% of professional positions at large employers, Asian Americans hold just 6% of senior management positions. Across the country, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a persistent gap between Asian American representation in entry-level professional positions and more senior management roles.  Even when adjusted for age, U.S.-born Asian American men with graduate degrees are 15% less likely to be in executive positions than white men with the same education credentials, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Moreover, Asian Americansâ\\x80\\x99 share of CEO positions in the S&P 500 Index of large U.S. companies has stalled at around 2% for the past decade.     Zeroing in on the 39 Asian Americans who have become CEOs at Fortune 500 companies, Goldman Sachs Research found that nearly all of them were born, raised or educated in the West. Of those 39 CEOs, 22 have a South Asian background. These Asian Americans execs are more likely to have graduate degrees and to lead younger firms than their white-CEO counterparts. More than 80% of the Asian Americans who got CEO appointments came after the company had had a financial stumble.  While Asian Americans have a long history in the U.S., their numbers were small until relatively recently. The Asian-American population has grown substantially since immigration restrictions were overhauled in 1965, rising from less than 1% in 1970 to more than 5%. The new immigration system was designed to attract highly skilled immigrants and to reunify families.       02 May 2022 Goldman Sachs Research Asianomics in America: Contributions and Challenges Read Report      U.S. immigration policy with its preferences for highly skilled, highly educated people from Asia is part of the reason this group is so highly educated compared with other Americans, according to research by Jennifer Lee, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Irvine, and Min Zhou, a professor of sociology at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and the University of California at Los Angeles.  But Asian Americans are obviously not a monolithic group, and much tends to depend on their pathway to immigration. Those who moved to the U.S. via high-skilled immigration programs (often from India and China) tend to have significantly higher incomes than those who arrived from Asia through other types of programs, and there is a wide gap in income inequality within the Asian-American population.  As the Asian American population grows, the group has had an outsized contribution to the U.S. economy, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Despite representing less than 10% of the population, Asian American made up nearly a quarter of U.S. employment growth from 2003 to 2019. This population also drove around 23% of private-sector output growth during that span, contributing $1.5 trillion in current dollar terms to the growth in gross domestic product.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 28 April 2022       Against the backdrop of war in Ukraine, 2022 is seeing renewed focus on energy security as Europe grapples with how to restructure its supply to reduce its reliance on Russia. The crisis has revealed the challenge ahead for the world as it faces geopolitical conflict, efforts to decarbonize and high global inflation. Today, the energy industry is at turning point, with an expected increase in investment across commodities, including oil and gas, according to Top Projects, Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s annual analysis of the energy sector. We spoke with Michele Della Vigna, head of Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 natural resources research in EMEA, to learn more.  In Top Projects 2022, which GS Research has been publishing for nearly 20 years, you talk about an underinvestment in energy over the last seven years. What has this meant for the sector?   There are three ways we can look at the depths of the underinvestment we have witnessed since 2015. Firstly, we can look at the reserve life in the sector. It used to be 50 years and itâ\\x80\\x99s now declined to 25 on the back of falling oil reserves and increasing production. This shows the lack of focus in exploration and resource expansion on the back of the push for decarbonization.  The second way to look at it is to ask ourselves: How much future production have we lost because of all the delays in investment decisions on new oil and gas projects? The answer is 10 million barrels per day of oil, which is the equivalent of Saudi Arabia's daily production and 3 million barrels per day of oil equivalent in liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is more than the equivalent of Qatar's daily production. If we had not kept delaying new investment decisions in oil and gas since 2014, we essentially could have had a new Saudi Arabia and a new Qatar.  The third way is just to look at the billion dollar numbers. In upstream oil and gas, the industry at the peak was spending $900 billion dollars per annum which troughed at $300 billion dollars in 2020, so a two-thirds reduction in capex. These are three different ways to look at the issue but the answer is the same: We have exhausted all of the spare capacity in the system, and now we are no longer able to cope with supply disruptions like the one we are currently witnessing because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  What role has the war between Russia and Ukraine had on investment in the energy space? Is the conflict the reason you expect energy investment to increase?  The issues around Russia and Ukraine have brought the importance of security of supply and the social importance of guaranteeing affordable energy access to a growing world population back to the forefront. Within that context, the conflict is also leading to a broader rebalancing of social versus environmental issues in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks of the investing community. Decarbonization is a key driver of decision-making but it needs to be balanced carefully with the social importance of affordable energy and the key role of natural gas in the energy transition.  We need more investment in energy as a whole following these seven years of underinvestment, including renewables, hydrogen and other low carbon sources of energy, but we also expect oil and gas investment to go up. We are seeing it first of all in the shorter cycle projects like U.S. shale but that also needs to extend to the longer cycle investments of deepwater, oil, gas and LNG. We think the pace of big oil and gas decisions is likely going to triple over the next three to five years versus what we have seen at the trough of the cycle in 2020.    Top Projects details a â\\x80\\x9cshrinkingâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9csteepeningâ\\x80\\x9d oil cost curve. What exactly does this mean?  In every commodity, when you try to forecast a future price, you want to understand the price needed to get enough new projects to be developed. Since 2017, the cost curve of oil has become smaller because there are fewer available resources and it's become steeper because higher oil prices will be needed for production and to supply energy for a growing world population. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s how a cost curve can help you in understanding the price dynamic in a commodity and thatâ\\x80\\x99s what we tried to do in Top Projects for oil and gas. At the current cost of capital, we need $90-per-barrel oil prices in order to get enough capacity on stream. A shrinking and steeping cost curve suggests upward pressure to long-term energy prices.  Is Europeâ\\x80\\x99s search for an alternative gas supply achievable? Top Projects expects the global production of LNG to be slow until 2025.  Europe needs new gas to come in to substitute the Russian imports and the obvious market to source that from is LNG because itâ\\x80\\x99s transported by ship, while pipeline gas supply is much more difficult to shift across geographies. LNG is one of the few alternatives of scale to Russian gas. There are two clear ways Europe can get more of this energy. Either it outbids current recipients and pays more than the likes of India and China, effectively taking LNG from that market. Alternatively, Europe needs to get new LNG to come to the continent. The problem with that is it takes four to seven years for new LNG projects to start production (from investment decision), so itâ\\x80\\x99s a very delayed answer to current higher prices. Our analysis shows there are not many projects coming on stream until 2025, which will make it very expensive for Europe to substitute Russian gas.  Are there any other key developments we should watch out for in energy sector in 2022?  There are three major areas of new investments. There is U.S. shale. We are already seeing strong activity leading to very strong cost inflation there (close to 30%). We think we are going to need a revival of new LNG projects in the U.S. and places like Africa and Papua New Guinea. We will also see a recovery of deepwater oil investments, mostly focused on Brazil, Guyana, the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 21 April 2022       Environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are increasingly driving corporate strategy in asset classes around the world. But when it comes to building real estate, is environmental impact â\\x80\\x93 particularly carbon emissions â\\x80\\x93 a critical concern for developers and investors? We sat down with Nora Creedon, an investor in private real estate within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, to discuss if buildings truly are going â\\x80\\x9cgreen.â\\x80\\x9d   Nora, when we think of climate change, real estate might not always be the first thing that comes to mind. But just how important is it in addressing this global crisis?  Statistics tell us that real estate is actually one of the best opportunities to address climate change even though so much of the focus has been on industries like transportation. Property and construction represent about 40% of both global energy use and emissions. So, shifting toward more sustainable building and operating practices can have a tremendous impact on climate change outcomes.    What are the key issues driving the demand and urgency for â\\x80\\x9cgreenâ\\x80\\x9d buildings?â\\x80\\x99  Itâ\\x80\\x99s really three things. The first is the global groundswell of support for more sustainability. Regulators and officials in cities around the world have also taken note of the impact property can have and weâ\\x80\\x99re observing more demands on property owners. For example, youâ\\x80\\x99re seeing London, Paris, Stockholm, New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and many other cities committing to carbon reduction as quickly as possible. With those commitments come new regulations for buildings to meet various efficiency and sustainability measures. The numbers of buildings that will be facing these new regulations and will potentially be unable to meet them are staggering.  Secondly, tenants increasingly want their spaces to represent their values and theyâ\\x80\\x99re willing to pay the premium for â\\x80\\x9cgreen buildings.â\\x80\\x9d Many corporate users of office space have committed to carbon neutrality goals; they need their real estate to be consistent with that. We also think the shifting dynamics post-COVID have led many tenants to proactively seek out more sustainable features in their space.  And finally, capital is increasingly being reallocated to sustainable strategies. As pension funds and other institutional clients make carbon commitments with their portfolios, that increasingly is going to drive more dedicated strategies toward sustainability. That has already happened in the public markets, but we think itâ\\x80\\x99s also likely to play out in the private markets in the coming years. And investors can make a case for premium valuations for sustainable assets, so you can expect more capital will therefore chase that dynamic, which creates a flywheel effect.  How important will green bonds be in the transformation of real estate?   Real estate is an asset class that typically can carry leverage given the predictability of cash flows. From their inception in 2007, issuance in what we call â\\x80\\x9cgreen bondsâ\\x80\\x9d has swelled to more than $375 billion, and that growth is really important for this space. In the U.S., real estate companies are now one of the largest corporate sectors for green bond issuance. The issuers are keenly focused on this market because thereâ\\x80\\x99s evidence to suggest that green bonds command a savings in financing costs (interest rates on green bonds are often lower than an ordinary bond from the same issuer.) Again, many of the same dynamics in the equity markets are in play here; more and more captive demand for sustainably oriented debt is driving better pricing for those securities.  Is greenwashing a threat? If so, what steps are being made to check misleading claims on sustainable building?  This is a really critical issue. Greenwashing is the practice of making misleading claims about ESG or sustainable products, assets and policies. We would anticipate more definition and clarity around the world of sustainability in the coming years so that greenwashing is minimized or eliminated. We are still in the early stages of understanding how to apply these ideas to real estate so the data is still nascent and so we have to assume there will be regional differences in how these principles are adopted. To that end, we are absolutely in favor of more transparency, more standardization and clearer disclosures.   What do investors have to gain from supporting and investing in green real estate?  We believe that building green and investing in green is not just the right thing to do for the planet, itâ\\x80\\x99s also a way to potentially generate better investment returns. If you look out 10 years into the future, there may be a lot of risk in owning assets that donâ\\x80\\x99t meet sustainability targets. Those assets may suffer from less tenant demand, higher operating costs and increased regulations. The cost of capital for those assets is likely to be relatively higher.  Weâ\\x80\\x99ve spent a lot of time quantifying the ways in which we can earn a premium return for our clients in green buildings, and it really comes down to a few factors. First, the cost to build green is normalizing as technology is maturing. Second, there are specific rental premiums earned in the highest of green standard buildings. And finally, the operating costs of green buildings should, over time, be relatively lower. And as mentioned, you can make a strong case that with higher investor demand for these types of assets, you may earn a premium valuation upon sale.  The challenge for investors is finding the right opportunities to build green or convert to green, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s really where weâ\\x80\\x99re focusing our efforts.

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 07 April 2022  Compared with other countries, the most disadvantaged in the U.K. are less likely to climb the income ladder and the economically advantaged tend to stay at the top. Covid-19 has increased inequality further, and recent rises in inflation, especially energy costs, are intensifying the problem. In a recent report, Goldman Sachs Research has taken a closer look at the issue, investigating what needs to be done to improve mobility and opportunity for people in the U.K. We sat down with authors of the research, Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 European Strategist Sharon Bell and Chief U.K. Economist Steffan Ball, to discover more.  Could you start by defining what social mobility is?     Steffan Ball: Put simply, it means doing better or worse in terms of lifetime outcomes than your parents. If you look at the U.K. and compare it with other developed countries, it stands near the bottom of the international league table for both social mobility and inequality. Itâ\\x80\\x99s important to clarify that the two things are slightly different. For example, you can live in a very unequal society but still have a very different life outcome to your parents.  On social mobility, political debate is often focused on who climbs up the social ladder and that is critical. But it should also consider whether better off families retain their social and economic position. And on this metric too, the poorest and the richest in the U.K. are the most socially immobile. So this exacerbates social inequalities. Only the U.S. and Switzerland have lower social mobility than the U.K.  Sharon, this is a relatively new area of research for Goldman Sachs. What would you say are the key takeaways from â\\x80\\x98The Bigger Picture: UK Social Mobility â\\x80\\x93 A Tough Climb?â\\x80\\x99  Sharon Bell: The primary thing is that the U.K., relative to the rest of Europe, looks pretty poor on most metrics on social mobility and things have actually deteriorated further in the last few years. The pandemic has made it worse; potentially the energy spike we are seeing will also make it worse. So the U.K. scores very poorly on most social mobility metrics and the key takeaway from our report is that there are things governments, policymakers and corporations can do to help address the problem. I feel that social mobility, as a particular diversity target and interest, is something that is more nascent than other areas (such as gender for example) and something which is also incredibly important given that itâ\\x80\\x99s already a wide gap and gotten worse.    Why is the U.K. performing so badly on social mobility and has the situation been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic?  Steffan Ball: There is actually very little consensus on causes of the U.K.â\\x80\\x99s relatively poor performance both on social mobility and inequality metrics. Some researchers have argued thatâ\\x80\\x99s itâ\\x80\\x99s due to a combination of strong education transmission from generations to generations and, added to that, the significant earning premium for graduate level jobs. A second explanation has been the large regional income differences we have in the U.K. and the growth of higher paying service sector jobs, particularly in the South. Finally, other researchers have noticed that the more progressive tax systems in some countries such as Denmark, Finland and Norway often lead to higher social mobility. And in the U.K., it could be that the tax system is disadvantageous to inequality and mobility.  Undoubtedly, the pandemic has increased inequality further and there is survey evidence to show this. YouGov did a report not so long ago and it showed over half - 56% - of the U.K. population felt Covid-19 had increased social inequality. This is consistent with the impact you see in the labor market.  Covid-19 has had a larger impact on lower income jobs as they tend to be consumer facing rather than office based. These lower income jobs were more likely impacted by government lockdowns, while office jobs could be done remotely more easily.  Surveys also show a big regional difference. People in the North of England tend to say they have experienced harsher conditions recently than people in the South â\\x80\\x93 particularly for employment and education. Survey evidence compiled by the Social Mobility Commission shows that 35% of people living in the North said Covid-19 had a detrimental impact on employment, whereas only 17% in the South did. On education: 21% in the North thought that they suffered more during the pandemic in terms of education outcomes, whereas only 8% of people thought that was the case in the South. More recently, rising energy prices are a concern, because they have a large impact on the households at the bottom of the income distribution and these people also tend to have little to no saving buffer as well.  How can social mobility be improved in the U.K.?  Steffan Ball: In the report we highlighted four main policy areas for improvement. The first one is improving geographical inequality by increasing public investment in less well-off regions of the U.K. The second is education and in particular focusing education on equalizing opportunities and improved access for children from lower income households. The third policy area is apprenticeships and retraining programmes that are retargeted toward people from disadvantaged backgrounds. And finally, high quality digital access for less wealthy households, in particular those living in more remote locations.  To what extent can the corporate world play a positive part in improving social mobility and inequality in the country?  Sharon Bell: The corporate sector can have quite a huge influence in the U.K. Who businesses choose to hire, who they decide to train, what safety nets they give people in terms of pay, healthcare, pensions, other benefitsâ\\x80\\x94all of those things are incredibly important. Also, how businesses invest and where they invest is so crucial. Are they investing offshore or are they investing onshore? Are they investing in a U.K. workforce or not? Are they just concentrated in one location, like London, or are they looking outside that?  I would put it into three buckets in terms of what companies can do to help improve social mobility: The first one is that they can do things internally. They should think of social mobility as part of the diversity spectrum. So they can look at the social backgrounds of their employees and think more broadly about their talent pool. Itâ\\x80\\x99s about looking for diversity of thought and not just picking from one area of the community. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the first and crucial thing.  Second, I do think some companies are operating in fields that will help social mobility by the very nature of what they do. For example, you have real estate companies, insurance companies, investment funds that are investing in infrastructure projects in the North of England or in social housing or social impact funds. Itâ\\x80\\x99s about using money in specific ways that will help to invest in underinvested communities. For example, are telecoms companies providing connectivity to everyone at good speeds now? Are tech companies making digital education as accessible as they could be? Maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s not some of these companiesâ\\x80\\x99 main objectives but, as part of their business, they can help social mobility.  Finally, the last area where businesses could be important is ESG investing. We tend to focus a lot on the E: the environment. We argue that there should be more focus on the S. ESG funds should be thinking about the social impact of companies. So companies that are having a good social impact should be seeing flows from ESG funds buying their equity and buying their debt, which will reduce their cost of capital and allow them to invest more in having a positive social impact.       24 February 2022 Goldman Sachs Research The Bigger Picture: UK Social Mobility - A Tough Climb Read Report'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 31 March 2022        Europeâ\\x80\\x99s tech entrepreneurs have arrived. The ecosystem of digital companies has grown twice as fast as in the U.S. during the past seven years, and funding in Europeâ\\x80\\x99s private companies eclipsed $100 billion for the first time in 2021.  We spoke with Clif Marriott, co-head of the technology, media and telecom group in EMEA at Goldman Sachs, about the growth in European startups following our Disruptive Technology Symposium last week. The event hosted nearly quarter of the regionâ\\x80\\x99s 220 unicorns â\\x80\\x94 a metric that highlights how much the sector has grown: Europe had fewer than 20 private tech companies backed by venture capital that were valued at $1 billion or more when the symposium first took place in 2016.  Marriott says one of the biggest topics of discussion at this yearâ\\x80\\x99s conference was the differential between valuations in public and private markets. While financing has slowed for now, he says Europeâ\\x80\\x99s unicorns have raised immense amounts of capital that will eventually result in large, well-funded companies going public.   The growth in European tech has been a major topic at Goldman Sachs events in recent weeks. What is your outlook for that sector?  In 2021, we executed more than $150 billion of M&A and financing transactions for tech and tech-enabled companies in Europe, which is an absolute record in terms of activity. This year, and especially the first half, we would expect to be much slower in terms of the activity levels and thatâ\\x80\\x99s really driven by volatility in the markets and lower overall valuations. That has slowed IPO activity to basically zero during the first half of this year.  That said, one of the key metrics, that $100 billion of capital that has gone into European companies in 2021, means two things. First, companies are getting bigger and theyâ\\x80\\x99re very well funded. Many of these private companies took capital last year when the market was really good. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re using that capital to grow their business and to invest. So thatâ\\x80\\x99s a positive thing.  Secondly, that there are 220 unicorns means there are a ton of private, very large companies that will eventually list, transact, conduct M&A, conduct financing, go public, direct list â\\x80\\x94 all kinds of interesting things.  From my standpoint, while the first half of 2022 will be definitely slower than 2021, I would expect that over the next two to five years we will see very, very strong activity from that collection of unicorns and the continued funding that goes into Europe.    Has the market turmoil impacted private markets differently than the way it impacted public markets?   This is probably the biggest theme that came out of the conference and also some of the networking activities that we held. The dislocation between the private and public is definitely here. I had one very large tech investor who said heâ\\x80\\x99s never in his career seen private and public valuations be so unlocked or separated.  I think thereâ\\x80\\x99s three things driving that. The public investors, and letâ\\x80\\x99s say hedge funds in particular, but institutional investors generally have become much more negative around the impact of inflation, and therefore the impact on asset values that have a long duration â\\x80\\x94 meaning the more the valuation of a company is dictated by its terminal value a long time out, the more that higher rates impede that valuation.  The second thing is that volatility has meant that there has been a lot of forced selling within technology, which means valuation levels have been impacted by that volatility.  The third thing is that private markets havenâ\\x80\\x99t adjusted as much. Very few if any of the tech companies are seeing any impact to their business from inflation, nor from the geopolitical situation, yet, and a lot of them have raised capital in the last two years and they donâ\\x80\\x99t see why their valuation should be impacted as much as the valuations have been impacted in the public markets.  This valuation differential will have to narrow one way or another. The bigger issue is really seen at the late stage, the companies that are raising one or two rounds before they go public, and therefore those valuations are much more driven by a time-value discount to what they could go public at in a couple of years. And if the effective IPO valuation is lower because multiples for their comps are lower, then that has an impact on their valuation.  Weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a lot less impact on valuations in the seed, series A, series B rounds where those companies are really investing over a 10-year period and multiples up, multiples down, isnâ\\x80\\x99t really going to drive an investment decision â\\x80\\x94 itâ\\x80\\x99s much more about the long-term market potential of these businesses. That part of the market hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been impacted as much.  Youâ\\x80\\x99ve also seen some of the large, letâ\\x80\\x99s say crossover institutions, mostly hedge funds, who have invested in very large private tech in the last two to three years, and they have moved down from doing crossover, late-stage pre-IPO investing to much more series A, series B, series C. So theyâ\\x80\\x99ve moved earlier in the stack, and therefore that market continues to be relatively healthy.   At what stage does Goldman begin working with European startups?            We start interacting with companies well before they go public. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not just a Europe phenomenon but a global phenomenon â\\x80\\x94 these tech companies are accessing private capital at higher volumes and for a longer period of time than ever before. Every year the average tech company raises more private capital and waits longer before going public.           We at Goldman canâ\\x80\\x99t wait for the IPO request-for-proposal in order to start interacting with the company. We start interacting with them much earlier â\\x80\\x94 two to three years, or even earlier, before they go public, weâ\\x80\\x99re starting to interact with them from the advisory side of the business.  On the institutional side of the business, our core investing clients want to have access to these companies earlier rather than waiting for them to go public. So for us itâ\\x80\\x99s synergistic to help or enable these large private companies, which 10 years ago probably would have gone public by now based on their size, but in this environment they can stay private and raise capital. We help those companies access capital and to meet and build relationships with large institutional investors who are investing more and more in private companies.   What else stood out to you during the conference?  Thereâ\\x80\\x99s so much to talk about with respect to technology in Europe. We spent a lot time talking about the markets at the conference. Putting that aside, I would say there were three things that came out that were especially interesting.  First, the hiring environment for tech talent is still incredibly aggressive. And there was a lot of debate in various of the sessions but also in some of the networking activities around how employees at tech companies are mission focused. And that, even more than compensation in some cases, was a driver for employees to move to those companies. So mission culture is really, really important for hiring the best people.  The second thing was discussions about the creator economy, Web 3, and it touches crypto as well â\\x80\\x94 these huge new industries that are being created involving influencers on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. These influencers need software to help manage their careers, need software to market their businesses, need payments solutions, need a currency with which to transact globally â\\x80\\x94 ie, can crypto be an interesting way to transact globally across borders, and that flows into not only the influencer community but also the multiverse or gaming community where there are whole economies online using different currencies or types of stores of value? All of those interesting things that are happening that are very new and not seen in the public markets.  And the last thing that came out was this change in mind set. European technology companies feel confident to raise capital, to invest that capital, become global, but in many cases to continue to base themselves in Europe and really go for the moon. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the most important thing that came out of the conference and the thing that excites me the most.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 17 March 2022  As the war between Russia and Ukraine escalates, global commodities markets are going through the most upheaval since the 1973 oil embargo on the U.S. But this time the energy crisis is most acute in Europe, which relies more heavily on Russian exports. And the shock isnâ\\x80\\x99t confined to one commodity. Russia is the second largest commodity producer in the world (behind the U.S.), and the repercussions of its invasion seem to have changed global supply chains overnight. We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Global Head of Commodity Research Jeff Currie for his view on global commodities and the impact on markets.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s around three weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine. Can you summarize the impact this has had on global commodity markets?  This is the biggest upheaval for commodity markets since 1973. But the comparison ends there. Other than this being a Europe centred shock, the other key way this crisis is different from the 1973 oil embargo is that this isnâ\\x80\\x99t just a shock to oil supply. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a shock to every single commodity: grains, oil, gas, metals, palladium, titanium, and neon. The list goes on. We have never seen anything like this before. Another big difference is that 1973 was a seller-boycott. This is a buyer boycott. Apart from the actual war, you also have an economic war in the sense that you have a decoupling between Russia and the West. The actual physical decoupling â\\x80\\x93 which will be seen in the commodity space â\\x80\\x93 hasnâ\\x80\\x99t even really started yet. We have seen the boycotts but the actual transition to do this is going to be a very painful process and difficult to physically achieve.  In addition to this physical decoupling, the financial decoupling is starting to impact commodity markets, too. There has been a sharp drop in the prices of many emerging market and Russia related assets, leaving investors facing large margin calls. To fund these, they must take profit on the only positions in the black: commodities. This has led to a fall in total interest in the space, as well as a fall in prices â\\x80\\x93 a clear sign of de-risking unconnected to fundamentals. Such profit taking only enhances the volatility now present in commodity markets.  Could you break down what this means for each commodity?  Letâ\\x80\\x99s start with gas. We havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen much disruption at this point in time. As it goes down pipelines from Russia to Europe and not on ships we still donâ\\x80\\x99t anticipate a similar disruption. But the market is pricing in something like a 75% chance of that happening, just because it would be so catastrophic. If it did happen, youâ\\x80\\x99re talking about a doubling of prices from here.   Turning to oil, theyâ\\x80\\x99re still loading the ships, but the ships arenâ\\x80\\x99t going anywhere and theyâ\\x80\\x99re likely to be redirected, which means there is still a physical shock coming down, just less than initially feared.  Grains have stopped. Metals have stopped. There is nobody in the ports to do it and you cannot get insurance to sail the ships into the region. The hit on grains is about 25% of wheat exports. Grains are probably the most stressed market right now, with the clearest risk to overall production, not just trade. What kind of planting season are we going to get in Ukraine this year? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a key question.  Turning to the metals, itâ\\x80\\x99s the same thing there. What you saw on the London Metal Exchange with nickel had nothing to do with the bullish fundamentals story, that had more to do with margin calls and crowded positioning, but is there upside here in the metals? Absolutely. And on precious metals; itâ\\x80\\x99s a perfect storm for gold right now. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the one commodity with the most upside, with the strongest and least uncertain story.  The bottom line is that in the near-term, there will be lots of uncertainty around oil. I think metals, grains and gold have less uncertainty around their upside, especially from these levels. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s also barring this turns into a recession.      Stepping back a little and looking further ahead, what does this mean for the long-term shape of the global commodities market?   What we have seen in the last few weeks is a reversion to the political economy of the cold war, with financial dislocation between Russia and the West, culminating in the closed capital accounts in places like Russia. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening in the West at the moment is that they have unwound energy liberalization and begun the process of reregulation, floating price caps and consumer energy subsidies. All of this has contributed to deglobalization and a physical decoupling between the East and West.  Finally, when thinking about the consequence of these policies, there are several things to remain aware of. Firstly, commodities are not homogeneous. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re not completely fungible. I think there is a belief we can easily distribute this stuff all around the world. But youâ\\x80\\x99re lengthening supply chains in an environment in which inventories are already low. Secondly, I think the other important point about this decoupling or deglobalization is that we are creating a bifurcated commodity market with growing risks of a dislocation between western and eastern commodity prices. Crucially, I would be watching that East-West bifurcation between oil prices and metal prices slowing down. The bottom line to all of this is that we view all this political shock as reinforcing the commodities supercycle.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The shortage of semiconductor chips is straining global supply chains, causing a drag on the production of an array of products from smartphones to new cars. We spoke to Alexander Duval, a technology analyst in Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs, after our virtual European Digital Economy Conference to discuss chip production and the impact of the Ukraine-Russia crisis on the sector. He highlighted how a number of European companies at the conference expect tightness in the supply and demand of semis to potentially persist in their particular product areas into early 2023, albeit with some gradual easing in certain types of chips in the second half of this year.  Based on your conversations at the recent technology conference, what did you hear about the backlog situation for European semiconductor producers and what is driving demand for their products?    Several companies highlighted very large backlogs for this year relative to what they can produce. The general view expressed was that new capacity would be needed for supply and demand to come into balance and that this could take some time.  As far as the demand picture for these European semis producers is concerned, there are obviously certain industries that their products go into which are rebounding or seeing strong growth â\\x80\\x94 automotive, for example, particularly given the limitation on what was produced during the initial innings of Covid. But more broadly across semis there are interesting secular demand drivers, whether we are talking about electrification of the car, the proliferation of the cloud, right through to other areas where semis have become a digital enabler of things like automated driving. And then of course the transition to 5G, as Europe and other economies digitalise, requires a lot of wireless equipment that in turn drives volumes of advanced semis.  What does this all mean for the supply chain crunch?           Demand for now as far as we can see remains good across all those areas I mentioned, though there is a lot of uncertainty on the broader macro picture. For there to be an easing in the tightness you either need demand in many of these areas to go down rather rapidly or you would need to see a significant amount of supply to come on stream, assuming of course that the level of double ordering is not significantly greater than these European semis companies believe to be the case.            And what does it mean for supply to come on stream?   This would mean these companies not only putting equipment into existing semiconductor fabrication facilities, but such producers, or their foundry partners who produce for them, needing to build new factories and ramping those up. And so our view is that weâ\\x80\\x99ve had a number of good quarters for many of these semis players in terms of earnings prints in a very, very tight supply-and-demand situation.  But we do think there were decisions made a number of quarters ago to start ramping supply. So the relevant facilities will at some point be up and running with supply coming on stream. And what we have seen is some companies talking about supply gradually coming on stream in the second half for certain types of semis, but plenty of other companies talking about only really a step change in the broader supply situation potentially happening end of this year, maybe even early 2023.   If these companies are right in their view that itâ\\x80\\x99s going to be more of a gradual easing, and only really in certain pockets, like power semiconductors, then this would mean there is tightness until next year.  You asked several executives about double ordering and what kind of inventory-correction risk there is. What was your takeaway from those conversations?  Broadly speaking companies did not highlight double ordering, with one talking about a high level of customer escalations to request more semis, implying genuine demand remains high. Further, several suggested inventories in the market are still very low. That said, several European semis companies will have made investment decisions multiple quarters ahead, and, given they donâ\\x80\\x99t have perfect information, it is possible that there could be some kind of inventory correction in future, even if the implication of some companiesâ\\x80\\x99 statements was that the risk of this would be more likely in the second half and in particular towards the end of the year.   Does the crisis in Ukraine change your projections for semiconductor supply and demand?  Itâ\\x80\\x99s obviously a very fluid situation and we canâ\\x80\\x99t say thereâ\\x80\\x99s no risk at all, but near term the risk seems relatively limited. If you think about the sort of end market exposure â\\x80\\x94 Russia is very small. Itâ\\x80\\x99s less than 1% of global IT spending. For the European semis companies we cover, the exposure is typically below 2%. The direct exposure to Russia-Ukraine is pretty low.  Now, one thing we have seen press reports about is neon gas. A decent amount of the market for this is located physically in Ukraine. And you need that for lithography machines, which use light to print patterns onto silicon wafers, such as those provided by ASML, a semiconductor company in the Netherlands. Some of these lithography machines do need this neon gas. But actually around 50% of ASML's lithography business, in terms of the types of machines, is actually EUV, which does not rely on neon. The DUV machines, which are not quite as advanced, do require neon. But theyâ\\x80\\x99re only getting 20% from Ukraine, as they also source from areas outside Ukraine. So we think it will have only a limited impact for them.  In terms of the broader semis landscape, weâ\\x80\\x99ve highlighted in our research that a certain number of the large semis manufacturers â\\x80\\x94 who could also theoretically be impacted by changes in the availability of neon â\\x80\\x94 have been saying that there isnâ\\x80\\x99t very much to worry about, in the near term at least, as far as their ability to produce or cost inputs are concerned. What youâ\\x80\\x99ve seen is that a number of these companies have diversified their sourcing of neon, meaning that they can get it from suppliers with whom they have contracts for a given price and given access to volumes outside Ukraine. We also believe it will be necessary to monitor the macroeconomic situation.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 10 March 2022   At the start of the year, Goldman Sachs Asset Management released Investment Ideas 2022, taking a deep dive into the key themes likely to influence investor behavior. But disruptive forces â\\x80\\x94 such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine â\\x80\\x94 are constantly evolving, presenting new challenges to the global economy. We sat down with Goldman Sachs Asset Managementâ\\x80\\x99s Candice Tse, global head of strategic advisory solutions, and Maria Vassalou, deputy chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions, to look at the impact disruption is having and how investors can navigate it.  Maria, the escalating humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is a deeply worrying development that is at the top of our minds. How disruptive could this conflict be in 2022?  Maria Vassalou: First and foremost, this is a human crisis. That is without a doubt the biggest consideration. The geopolitical conflict in Ukraine is disruptive because it reshapes the global economic balance of powers. While Europe is aligned with the U.S. on sanctions, its economy is bearing the bulk of the negative spillover effects of the war given its dependency on Russia for 40% of its energy supplies. The increase of energy and commodity costs is likely to impact European growth dynamics and keep inflation stubbornly high for longer than previously thought.  We see Germany deciding to significantly boost defense spending, meeting NATOâ\\x80\\x99s 2% of GDP target. At the same time, Japan is inviting the U.S. to install nuclear weapons on its soil and Switzerland is breaking from its traditional neutrality by matching EU sanctions on Russia. A new version of Cold War mentality may be emerging, with the potential to greatly affect growth dynamics going forward as well as the global investment landscape.  Candice, how could the Ukraine conflict impact Europe more broadly?   Candice Tse: Firstly, as Maria highlighted, it is important to emphasize that the violence has and will continue to have a tremendous human impact. Undoubtedly, Ukraine, Russia and their neighbors will feel the greatest direct impact as the conflict escalates. On the other hand, Russia and Ukraine account for 3% and 0.4% of global gross domestic product on a purchasing power parity basis, respectively, so the direct impact on broader global economic growth from weakness in Russia or Ukraine will likely be limited. Still, outside of Russia and Ukraine, European markets particularly are likely to experience the greatest impact from rising tensions in three ways: disrupted trade; tighter financial conditions; and interdependent gas supplies. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s why:          First, trade spillovers from conflict and sanctions may weigh on Europe as the EU runs a trade deficit with Russia. For context, while Russia may only be the U.S.â\\x80\\x99s 23rd largest trading partner, it is among the top five trading partners for the EU. Still, EU trade with Russia remains a relatively small percentage of overall trade activity at 6% of total extra-EU trade. Second, financial conditions are likely to continue tightening, especially if equities become more discounted and sovereign and credit spreads grow wider. While the impact on financial conditions in Europe has been fairly limited during past episodes (e.g. Crimea in 2014), the risk of tighter financial conditions remains skewed to the downside.          Third, consequences on the European energy market are likely to be most significant, as Europe depends heavily on Russia for its gas consumption. Further escalation may deepen the current energy crisis and lead to higher inflation in Europe, if not the rest of the world.    Maria, in addition to the war in Ukraine, what are other disruptive forces at play?  Maria Vassalou: Inflation is arguably the biggest uncertainty and driver of investor behavior in 2022. It remains to be seen how the tightening of financial conditions affects inflation. Risk to the outlook has very much to do with inflation and the reactions of central banks in their efforts to curb it. No policymakers have ever dealt with this policy situation before so itâ\\x80\\x99s very much unchartered waters.  Inflation is not what people would usually think of as disruptive, but right now, this is probably the biggest disruptive force as it really throws a wrench into the whole playbook of how you invest and how you think of the world. The way it is handled now will affect where we are going to be two years from now and whether we will be growing or in recession.  It will be largely central bank action, especially in the U.S., that will determine whether the economies will face stagflation going forward or recession. In Europe, the EU is considering issuing joint bonds to fiscally support the member states against the financial strain imposed on them from the energy and commodity crisis. Further fiscal stimulus is less likely in the U.S., but how much and how fast the Fed raises interest rates will determine whether the U.S. enters a period of stagflation or whether it experiences a recession in the next 12-18 months. Fewer hikes could result in stagflation whereas a more aggressive tightening cycle could precipitate a recession. Some sources of inflation, such as housing, will be more effectively curbed through a recession as demand decline may cool prices. The task of the Fed of bringing inflation back down to 2% given the forces that fuel it, is extraordinarily challenging from a policy design perspective, increasing the probability of recession.  Candice, are there any other disruptive themes we should we be on the lookout for in 2022?   Candice Tse: We have obviously spoken about some big events currently in play in 2022. But there are some other long-term disruptive themes that cut across every single sector and geography. Those come in the form of: the â\\x80\\x9ctechificationâ\\x80\\x9d of everything; changing global demographics; and the growing importance of sustainability.          First, rapid technology adoption weeds out companies across industries. If they canâ\\x80\\x99t keep up, they donâ\\x80\\x99t stay in business. Over the course of time, the average lifespan of companies, especially in the S&P 500 index, has dropped to 21 years from 35. You canâ\\x80\\x99t just invest in companies and hope they will last for 30+ years. Companies have a shorter lifespan today.  And technology growth is closely interrelated with two other trends that will disrupt markets and the global economy in the future. There are now billions of millennials and Gen-Zâ\\x80\\x99ers around the world â\\x80\\x93 easily making them the largest generation now. Millennials make up the biggest cohort of the adult population, so compared to prior generations, they represent the generation with the greatest earnings and spending power. This generational disruption is happening now.  And finally, many people from these generations have grown up with a different mantra; they want to do good and do well, at the same time. So being socially responsible is important in terms of what they are buying and investing in. Sustainability is key and decarbonization is now one of the most urgent priorities for the world.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 03 March 2022   Are there signs of healing in Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s property sector? When the indebted property giant China Evergrande Group started defaulting on its payments last fall, fear spread that a potential bankruptcy would trigger a broader crisis in Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s debt markets â\\x80\\x94 and global markets more broadly. Several months later, defaults on Chinese property bonds continue to remain elevated.  We spoke with Kenneth Ho from Goldman Sachs Research and Salman Niaz of Goldman Sachs Asset Management for their views on Chinese property credit and the Asia high-yield sector more broadly to understand what has changed.  Property developersâ\\x80\\x99 debt-repayment problems have been among the biggest issues roiling Asiaâ\\x80\\x99s credit markets over the past year. Kenneth, as Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Asia credit strategist, how are you thinking about the China property high-yield market today?  Kenneth Ho: Credit conditions remain very tight. It feels that the market is still under a lot of stress, as a lot of easing measures from China policymakers have been piecemeal and havenâ\\x80\\x99t led to a big impact on the physical market, and companies are still having trouble making payments. Our expectation going forward is that you would get more easing but at the same time you get more defaults. In 2022, we have a base-case estimate for a China property high-yield default rate of 19%. Last year was over 28%, so itâ\\x80\\x99s still at very elevated levels of defaults. Saying that, we do expect the stronger companies to survive and these bigger, stronger companies are ultimately going to be the main beneficiaries of policy easing as lenders feel more comfortable extending credit to stronger companies. This will create winners and losers.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to speak in terms of opportunities â\\x80\\x94 it continues to be a difficult environment. We do think you can generate decent returns from China property high-yield but the risk around that is very high. Our view is to stay at the very high end and be diversified and wait for news to come before making a more definitive directional stance. You donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be overly concentrated on specific issuers as idiosyncratic risks remain high. So itâ\\x80\\x99s a neutral view; stay up in quality and be diversified.  2022 hasnâ\\x80\\x99t got off to an encouraging start. How much more pain could Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s property market see â\\x80\\x94 and could we turn a corner?  Kenneth Ho: You have to ask, whatâ\\x80\\x99s the ultimate aim here? Itâ\\x80\\x99s a medium-term deleveraging of the property sector. This is after a massive credit boom in China, post the global financial crisis. Itâ\\x80\\x99s trying to deleverage the property sector without causing a systemic crisis. Policymakers are being very pragmatic as we move along, introducing policy easing to cushion the downside effects without deviating from their medium-term goal.                                     Itâ\\x80\\x99s likely going to be volatile in the coming months. The physical market likely wonâ\\x80\\x99t stabilize until the later part of this year, which means there will be an extended period of volatility. We think the key here is on policy. Our 19% estimate for a China property high-yield default rate this year is based on more piecemeal easing which will eventually stabilize the sector, but it is a long grind. More defaults will come. And if easing comes at a slower pace, more companies will default and it will be closer to our downside case of 31.6% for default estimation. It all really hinges on policy outlook. Itâ\\x80\\x99s been difficult â\\x80\\x94 the way policy has shifted in the last year has been a surprise to many market participants.             Salman, letâ\\x80\\x99s get your thoughts on the investment opportunities given your role as head of Asia Credit for Goldman Sachs Asset Managementâ\\x80\\x99s Emerging Market team. How are you approaching investment opportunities in Asiaâ\\x80\\x99s high-yield sector more broadly?  Salman Niaz: We approach the asset class recognizing structural value and attractive total return potential, but with heightened uncertainty in the near-term, emanating from the Chinese high-yield property sector which continues to remain under significant pressure.  Utilizing our preferred benchmark as a starting point, which benefits from a relatively high degree of regional diversification and based on a range of potential default rate and recovery scenarios, we calculate potential cumulative return expectations over two years of between -2% and 24% (as of January 31st).  To get -2% you have to believe that almost two-thirds of Chinese property high-yield will default during 2022 from here, and expect a 10 cent recovery for every dollar invested. To get to a 24% return expectation, you have to believe that a quarter of Chinese property high-yield bonds default this year.   This leaves us with two important conclusions for investors. Number one: diversification is critical to help mitigate downside scenarios. And number two: If you are well diversified, the asymmetry of returns is heavily skewed to a positive return scenario (the downside is minimal even in a disaster scenario). But with the elevated default risks in the sector as Ken just explained, diversification is the way to invest.  We evaluate the return expectations we have for the market over a two-year cycle rather than one, as the visibility on restructurings and recovery is likely to be much higher in 24 months than in 12. While it may be early to get too excited about the investment opportunity in China property high-yield bonds, a recent restructuring proposal made by a Chinese property high-yield company highlights the potential for high recoveries. A mid-sized developer that defaulted in Q4 2021, has offered a par-for-par amend and extend proposal for offshore bond holders offering a package that could be worth 65-75 cents of present value assuming high discount rates. If other China property companies follow suit â\\x80\\x94 and the sector stabilizes â\\x80\\x94 the total returns could well be towards the high end of the range mentioned above.  How are you positioned within your portfolios? And what are the risks to be aware of?   Salman Niaz: Putting the global macro risks aside, the most elevated risk elements in expected returns from Asia high-yield include: a lack of precedent in terms of restructuring and recovery of this scale. In Asia â\\x80\\x94 especially in China property â\\x80\\x94 this is an unprecedented situation, so we cannot overly rely on historical experiences. The other risk is that this market requires government policy support, and for investors itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to predict the timing or nature of potential policy announcements.  We find tremendous opportunities in Asia beyond China, particularly in India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Weâ\\x80\\x99re particularly focused on attractively valued non-cyclical businesses across the renewable utilities and TMT sectors that we believe are undervalued given their resilience. We are cautiously optimistic on return outcomes in China property, however the risk environment does not lend itself to taking high concentration risk in any individual situation, and we believe a patient and selective approach is warranted. That said, very high yield levels justify being invested.   Finally, what are some of the issues that youâ\\x80\\x99ll be watching that could impact your investments in the sector?   Salman Niaz: In China, we are closely monitoring policy announcements but, crucially, the real-world impact of these policies. There are three things we are watching: signs of stabilization in the physical market; an indication liquidity conditions are improving for developers; and company access to funding markets and for signs of onshore and offshore bond markets opening. Despite being announced in December, it is worth highlighting that Chinese policy maker support for the sector is now starting to show signs of implementation across cities; we are seeing reduced home purchase restriction, lower down-payments and encouragement of banks to lend to the sector.  Finally, for global investors, where policy uncertainty is often highlighted as a key challenge, we would note that policy risk exists across the investment landscape. After all, itâ\\x80\\x99s very difficult to anticipate the Fed, or how political cycles in Brazil or Argentina, or constitutional reform in Chile, may unfold.  In an environment dominated by a focus on the Fed, commodities, and European geopolitical risk, Asia high-yield and China property risk can contribute to diversification at a portfolio level given its unique and idiosyncratic risk factors.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 24 February 2022   In our recent Black Womenomics: Equalizing Entrepreneurship report, new research from Goldman Sachs delves into the entrepreneurial and economic inequalities facing Black women in the U.S. From access to capital and financial education, to the effects of discrimination and bias, the research paints a daunting picture of the challenges facing Black entrepreneurs. We sat down with Gizelle George-Joseph, global chief operating officer for Goldman Sachs Research and author of this research, to take a closer look.  Gizelle, what was your key takeaway from the new Black Womenomics: Equalizing Entrepreneurship?  Gizelle George-Joseph: The headline is that Black women own less; they make up roughly 6% of the U.S. population but own just 2% of employer businesses. The imbalance is particularly stark for single Black women, just 0.5% of whom own a business â\\x80\\x94 a rate that is 24-times lower than for single white men. This is important because business ownership has a large impact on economic progress. Credit market challenges, low levels of wealth and liquidity constraints all create substantial barriers to entry for Black entrepreneurs. Financial knowledge gaps and structural discrimination compound these issues and impact opportunities for Black women.         09 FEB 2022 Goldman Sachs Research Black Womenomics: Equalizing Entrepreneurship Read Report       What is the impact of unequal access to capital for Black-owned businesses?   Gizelle George-Joseph: The data shows that Black entrepreneurs are 20% less likely to fund their startups with bank business loans; instead they are more likely to rely on more expensive personal credit card debt and personal and family savings. Likely because theyâ\\x80\\x99re undercapitalized, Black businesses are overrepresented in sectors with low capital intensity, such as health care and social assistance, and underrepresented in sectors with high capital intensity like real estate and construction. Undercapitalization also impacts profitability and this is corroborated by Black business owners who report (at three times the rate of white entrepreneurs) that access to financial capital and the cost of financial capital negatively impact the profitability of their businesses. On top of that, persistent structural, social and economic inequality have caused Black entrepreneurs to become disillusioned and this impacts their entrepreneurial behavior. For example, many Black business owners wonâ\\x80\\x99t even apply for financing because they think their requests are going to be denied. So access to capital impacts a lot â\\x80\\x94 business growth, profitability and overall business sustainability.   How important is financial education in equalizing opportunities for Black women?  Gizelle George-Joseph: Financial education is a cornerstone of financial wellness and consequently, of economic growth. One academic study estimates that financial knowledge accounts for more than 30% of retirement wealth inequality. Yet Black Americans, and especially Black women, lag white Americans on financial knowledge. Financial information gaps contribute to expensive borrowing and frictions on the investment side. The data shows that familiarizing Black women with investment risks and risk tolerance would increase the likelihood of owning high-return assets. And overall, higher levels of financial education would lead to better financial wellness.  To what extent do discrimination and bias play a role in limiting the success of Black women?  Gizelle George-Joseph: The subject of race and prejudice remains a complex and controversial one to navigate, but multiple studies document that high levels of discrimination persist in the labor and credit markets and really impact the opportunities of Black Americans. One remarkable study presented Black and white mystery shoppers as customers seeking credit from traditional banks. The takeaways from this field experiment were striking. First, Black businesses are scrutinized at a much higher level than white-owned businesses. Second, Black business owners are prodded for more personal information than white business owners. In the field experiment, while both Black and white testers were asked about their marital status by loan officers, which is a violation of the fair lending law, Black American testers were asked almost six times more often. And finally, Black business owners receive less customer service help. This is just one example, but it underlines that structural discrimination remains a material factor in the disadvantage faced by Black Americans in the credit markets.  What actions can be taken to address entrepreneurial and economic inequality experienced by Black women?   Gizelle George-Joseph: Closing the gaps requires a commitment across the public and private sectors, and the potential solutions we outline in the research are by no means exhaustive. To help close the capital access and investment gaps for Black entrepreneurs, policymakers could enforce fair lending laws to address discrimination in the credit market and expand access to capital for Black women. For the private sector, providing access to capital for Black women entrepreneurs is also at the top of the list. Easier access to capital would reduce dependence on more expensive forms of credit and the use of personal savings, factors that often inhibit the success of Black women-owned businesses. This would likely increase the number of Black women entrepreneurs, support existing small businesses and grow long-term wealth. When you combine that with mentoring, coaching and providing Black women entrepreneurs with educational frameworks that will expand their financial capabilities, this would really help set a solid foundation for sustained economic mobility.  Finally, can you expand on how this research builds on your report, Black Womenomics, launched last year? What do you see as the ultimate impact of this research?  Gizelle George-Joseph: Black Womenomics: Investing in the Underinvested was our assessment of the 90% wealth gap of Black women and its relationship with the broader economic and social disadvantages Black women face in the U.S. We looked at the earnings gap, the education gap, capital access and its impact on home and business ownership, as well as the role that inheritances and gifts play in perpetuating the wealth gap through generations. And importantly, we also looked at the health gap, as Black women experience significantly less favorable health outcomes. So we really tackled a broad range of issues in our foundational study. In Equalizing Entrepreneurship, we deep dive specifically into business ownership â\\x80\\x93 which is a really important component of wealth. We look at the challenges that Black women have starting and sustaining a business and the impact of accessing capital and financial education in, well, equalizing entrepreneurship. And research and advocacy are so critical in this journey toward racial economic equality. Being able to use our platform as Goldman Sachs Research to elevate awareness and to offer actions to help mobilize change is pretty powerful. We have a long history of writing on the topic of inclusive growth, which started with Womenomics in 1999. The idea behind the research is that investing in women is not just a fair thing to do, but itâ\\x80\\x99s good for business and good for the economy. As a Black woman, I am really proud that we have turned the lens of that research on racial economic inequality as well.     Related: One Million Black Women: Black in Business'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 17 February 2022     Clean hydrogen has emerged as a critical technology to reach net-zero carbon emissions. This is why more than 30 countries have released official hydrogen strategies and roadmaps to ramp up their hydrogen consumption and develop the required infrastructure. The targets in these strategies show they are poised to increase capacity over 400-fold in this decade as compared with 2020. We spoke with analyst Zoe Clarke in Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs about green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable energy, and her estimate that $5 trillion of investment is needed in the clean hydrogen supply chain to achieve net zero, as policy, scalability and affordability come together.   Which industries do you expect to be most impacted by hydrogen energy in the next three to five years?  Zoe Clarke: We believe the clean hydrogen revolution begins in existing end-markets of hydrogen as de-carbonization starts to unfold. Today there already exists more than 75 million tons of hydrogen demand from industries including refineries; ammonia, methanol and other chemicals manufacturing; and steel. As such, we view that the clean hydrogen revolution starts with the existing hydrogen market that needs to be de-carbonized, dominating the near-term pipeline of clean hydrogen projects â\\x80\\x94 green steel in particular is also starting to make an entry â\\x80\\x94 before it penetrates new markets, such as heavy-duty long-haul trucking, shipping, aviation, power generation, energy storage and more.  $5 trillion is obviously a very big number. Is the financing available to achieve that?  Zoe Clarke: We donâ\\x80\\x99t have an explicit, published view on where the $5 trillion can be financed from, yet if we use other technologies as a comparable example, including wind, solar and batteries, such financing has come from a mix of public and private investments. Developing the right policy framework will be critical for the de-risking of the industry and can provide the visibility required to encourage further private investments.  Your research shows a substantial number of hydrogen projects coming from Australia, Africa, Europe and Latin America, but relatively few in the pipeline from the U.S. and Asia. Why is that?  Zoe Clarke: For Asia the reason is lack of visibility: We do not have the same visibility and corporate disclosure in Asia as we do in Europe with respect to green-hydrogen projects and capacity additions. Our projects list comprises all the publicly announced projects from companies across the globe that we could identify and these, for the near-term, appear to be concentrated in Europe, Middle East, Latin America, Australia. We do expect that there will be projects moving ahead in regions such as China but we do not have the greatest visibility or plenty of explicit, publicly disclosed announcements from that region.  The U.S. is an interesting region and clean hydrogen can be a very important technology to its de-carbonization path given the large share of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s emissions attributed to transportation, and in particular long-haul heavy trucks.  We therefore view that the U.S. may be an upcoming region from which a lot of the growth comes in the near and medium-term for clean hydrogen, but the interest so far has been primarily focused on the transport end-market rather than necessarily the broader clean-hydrogen economy. For instance, fuel-cell manufacturing has been a technology largely developed by many corporates in the country, yet the electrolyzer technology is only starting to gain momentum in the region. We view that this will change, especially considering the $9.5 billion that has been pledged to develop hydrogen as a clean energy source as part of the U.S. Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act, which has been passed into law. Nonetheless, for the moment if we look at the green-hydrogen-dedicated projects, these are primarily concentrated in Europe in the near-term, and in the Middle East, Latin America and Australia in the medium-term.  Will high gas prices in Europe accelerate the adoption of hydrogen energy in that region?  Zoe Clarke: Absolutely. Higher hydrocarbon prices are acting as a form of implicit carbon pricing, given the lack of global coordination for the development of an explicit carbon-pricing market. The environment we currently see in Europe creates a unique dynamic, as a combination of historically high gas prices and high carbon prices make grey hydrogen, or fossil-fuel-based hydrogen, relatively uncompetitive compared to green. This dynamic is already tilting the scales towards green hydrogen. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, earlier this year stated that, due to the rise in gas prices, green hydrogen today can already be at cost parity with grey.  If we look at a country-level, countries like Germany and the U.K. are accelerating their efforts in the space. Germany is working on providing greater funding availability for green hydrogen projects and the U.K. has stated its intension to blend 20% hydrogen into the gas grid as early as next year. So clearly the unique environment that we see in Europe at the moment with higher commodity prices and higher carbon prices is making green hydrogen more attractive in comparison.  Are technology advances necessary to achieve these forecasts, or can this be done with off-the-shelf technology?  Zoe Clarke: We can achieve the clean hydrogen revolution we envisage with existing technologies but we certainly require existing technologies to reduce in costs on the back of scale and automation, whilst technological innovation continues to improve the technological offering.  There will be new technology entrants in the industry, and the current corporates in the industry are increasingly focused on developing optimized, high-performance technologies that can deliver green hydrogen at a more competitive price.       04 February 2022 Goldman Sachs Research Carbonomics: The Clean Hydrogen Revoltuion Read Report'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 10 February 2022     What does it take to be an entrepreneurial success story? In the case of Tracy Graham, founding partner and managing principal of private equity firm Graham Allen Partners, quite a lot. Grahamâ\\x80\\x99s life story involved an upward struggle out of poverty in Chicago; being recruited by famed coach Lou Holtz to play football at the University of Notre Dame; and launching a successful career in the private equity industry. At a recent Goldman Sachs Asset Management Forum event, he sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Katie Koch, CIO of the Asset Management Divisionâ\\x80\\x99s Public Equity business, and Sean Legister, managing director in Alternatives Capital Markets & Strategy, to talk about his journey.               Tracy Graham            Katie Koch: At Goldman Sachs Asset Management, weâ\\x80\\x99re big believers that the diversity of oneâ\\x80\\x99s life experiences can bring valuable lessons to their workplace as well as to the investing process. You grew up in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago. Can you tell us what that was like?  Tracy Graham: When I was growing up, the Englewood neighborhood was known as the murder capital of Chicago. It still is today. Getting out of that community is a very difficult thing. Of approximately 100 young men who grew up with me in that neighborhood at the time, not one graduated from college. Today, the overwhelming majority have either a police record or are serving time. Many don't make it past high school.   Katie Koch: What impact did this have on you and how did you succeed?  Tracy Graham: Growing up in this environment was central to helping me use intuition to read people â\\x80\\x94 to know whatâ\\x80\\x99s right and wrong. If you were unable to do that in our community, you would end up in trouble. I was extremely lucky. Part of my story is a bit of luck, a lot of hard work and in my case, a great mom. It seems like nothing to most people but she gave me $20 to take an entrance exam to go to a private school in Chicago, St. Rita High School, and it changed my life forever. The most important thing she ever did was just to instill in me the idea that I could be successful and that I was put on earth to do something special. It makes me grateful and thankful for being in the position that Iâ\\x80\\x99m in, which is why Iâ\\x80\\x99ve focused my business and personal life around doing great things for others.  Katie Koch: The power of having someone believe in you is obviously extraordinary â\\x80\\x94 and itâ\\x80\\x99s certainly important for raising our own kids and leading our teams. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s certainly a narrative in the U.S. that you can do anything if you put your mind to it. But thereâ\\x80\\x99s also a strong counternarrative that speaks to the tremendous odds stacked against people, such as your stat that only 1 in 100 people typically make it out of your neighborhood. How do you reconcile those views?  Tracy Graham: While the American dream is true, you are going to have to persevere, and things are going to be tough. The biggest hurdle is being let in the room, and I still deal with that today. I am 48 years old. I have sold four or five companies. Some of my mentors are some of the best business people in the world. For me, Notre Dame got me into the room. But many of the things we talk about â\\x80\\x94 about being able to pull yourself up â\\x80\\x94 arenâ\\x80\\x99t true for 99.9% of the people who look like me. We have to be able to take very talented people and let them into the room. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a challenge and itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to solve, but I do believe one little thing that we can do as mentors and sponsors is to tell people they can do it. I know it sounds simple but many of them doubt itâ\\x80\\x99s possible for them. I believe Iâ\\x80\\x99m in a unique position because I look like a lot of those people who are not in the room and I can let them in and I have an obligation to do that. We have to give people an opportunity.  Sean Legister: You mentioned Notre Dame as a catalyst for opening doors for you and credited coach Lou Holtz with being able to recruit you and get you there. Can you tell us how that went?  Tracy Graham: There were two key moments I remembered from that time. The first was that when Lou Holtz came to our house and our community, he sent the signal that he was at home. Almost every other person who came to our neighborhood would have felt out of place. But he did not. He connected with me and my mom. The second thing he did was that he didnâ\\x80\\x99t promise me a career in the NFL. In fact, he told me it was likely I would never get to play in the NFL. Instead, he told me: â\\x80\\x98If you give Notre Dame four years of your life, Notre Dame will give you 40 years back.â\\x80\\x99 And that became true. I also played with Jerome Bettis [former running back who played in the NFL] and he was literally the first investor in my first business, and we have a very tight relationship.  Sean Legister: Can you tell us a little about the creation of Graham Allen Partners and how you found success investing in data analytics and tech?  Tracy Graham: When I graduated from Notre Dame in 1995, I knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur. I started this internet company in 1996 with an $80,000 investment from Jerome Bettis. I was 22 years old with no business experience. I wanted to connect people and their homes to the internet. We built that company over a two-year period to be the second-largest privately held company in the country. We then acquired 23 other companies, merged them all together and sold them in 1999, just before the dot-com bust.  What I learned from that period is that the Midwest was way behind in technology, and there was a window of time between when a truly disruptive technology is created and when it reaches the heartland, if you will. That was true of traditional internet service. Itâ\\x80\\x99s been true of the cloud, SaaS and data. And so we started to think about how we could take advantage of that gap.  My next business was the data center business. We started building data centers with the same playbook. We focused mainly in the Midwest. Our thesis was that companies were going to move their servers and systems to a centralized data center environment. That innovation was already happening on the West Coast and to some extent on the East Coast. And we saw an opportunity to take advantage of it in the heartland. And weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing this today in data sciences. You go into most middle America companies with $250 million in revenue or less, itâ\\x80\\x99s unlikely theyâ\\x80\\x99ll have a data scientist or someone focusing on data there.  After that, I had built up enough of my own capital to start Graham Allen Partners and started investing off my own balance sheet. Our strategy is to buy mature companies at eight to 10 times multiples of cash flow and to improve the growth and margins of those businesses using data and analytics. In addition, we try to buy companies that will ultimately become the platforms for a fragmented industry.  And finally, if any of the companiesâ\\x80\\x99 data sets â\\x80\\x94 which we donâ\\x80\\x99t pay for â\\x80\\x94 becomes valuable, that creates an upside revenue opportunity for us. And as for the name, Allen is Kenneth Allen, who is a childhood friend. Up through 8th grade, we went to school together. Both Kenneth and I wanted to go to St. Rita High School together. We both needed money to take the entrance exam. He asked his mom; she said no. I asked my mom; she said yes. Kenneth went to the local school and he got involved in things. But long story short, Kenneth was killed in my senior year. So Graham is for me and the Allen is in memory of Kenneth Allen.  Katie Koch: Lastly, letâ\\x80\\x99s pivot to the manufacturing sector. Are you investing in any manufacturing companies in the Midwest? How do you view the space and its future, especially around the concept of reshoring, job creation and technological innovation?  Tracy Graham: Weâ\\x80\\x99re bullish on manufacturing. We havenâ\\x80\\x99t made a direct investment yet but we have a couple we expect to close soon. Having been in the data center business for a long time, I look at a manufacturing plant and see a big data-center. Labor is a big issue and we think data and automation is a big part of that. Of course, timing is important and we think over the next couple of years â\\x80\\x94 given the labor shortages and the high costs of labor â\\x80\\x94 technology will be the answer to driving down costs and getting margins back in line. We think there will be a huge opportunity to make investments in data and automation in the manufacturing space, especially in the Midwest.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 03 February 2022     The European Union is aiming to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by the end of this decade compared to 1990 levels, a goal that GS Research says requires a major â\\x80\\x93 and urgent â\\x80\\x93 push to electrify industries from transport to manufacturing. We sat down with Alberto Gandolfi, head of European Utilities Research, to discuss the steps European economies need to take now on their path to net zero.  Alberto, the Fit for 55 plan, part of the European Green Deal, outlines emissions goals that you argue will lead to an increase in power demand. Can you tell us more about how you expect power consumption in the region to change?  Alberto Gandolfi: Europe is on the cusp of an electrification push that could lead to a roughly 50% increase in power demand through 2030. As an example, when a typical household acquires an electric vehicle and installs a heat pump, its electricity consumption rises three-fold. We estimate that the EUâ\\x80\\x99s target to reduce emissions from road transport by roughly 50% this decade will require about 40% of drivers to switch to an EV â\\x80\\x93 the equivalent to 100mn electric cars on European roads. The growing need to electrify sources including passenger cars, heat pumps, electrolyzers and industrial motors means electricity could account for roughly half of primary energy consumption by 2030, versus about 20% today.  How will the sources of power change in light of this rising demand?  Alberto Gandolfi: : At the moment, about 40% of European power production comes from renewable sources like hydro, wind, solar and biomass. That share could reach 70% by the end of the decade. To comply with the Fit for 55 targets and the resulting increase in power demand, Europe could see its wind and solar installed base quadruple. Itâ\\x80\\x99s worth noting, however, that the process of scaling up investment in renewables will unfold gradually and continue to accelerate through the end of the decade. Consider the time needed to develop and staff larger pipelines, then convert them into actual assets â\\x80\\x93 it implies a lag between when new policies are announced and peak capacity growth is realized.  Green capex is quickly becoming one of the dominant drivers of infrastructure investment on a global scale. How is this unfolding in Europe and what level of investment in green energy infrastructure is needed to meet the regionâ\\x80\\x99s de-carbonization goals?  Alberto Gandolfi: We estimate that the electrification push needed to meet the EUâ\\x80\\x99s goals will require Europe to free up â\\x82¬3.7tn of capital over the coming nine years. Over half of this could be privately funded (roughly â\\x82¬2.2tn), an amount we think will be invested mostly by clean energy companies, with the remainder split between energy efficiency spending and grants. The investments will be used to develop renewable energy sources, upgrade power grids, refurbish buildings and support the switch to electricity for the mobility, real estate and manufacturing industries.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 27 January 2022     How are small businesses faring in the U.K.â\\x80\\x99s post-pandemic recovery? We spoke with Charlotte Keenan, head of Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Office of Corporate Engagement International, about the teamâ\\x80\\x99s latest research, Engines of Growth, which looks at how small businesses in the U.K. are adapting and thriving during a period of extreme uncertainty.  Charlotte, what are you seeing in the small business community?  Charlotte Keenan: As the pandemic has continued to evolve, so have the challenges faced by small business owners. To truly understand the effects of COVID-19 on the U.K.â\\x80\\x99s small business population, we conducted a survey of over 1,000 entrepreneurs, including graduates of the firmâ\\x80\\x99s 10,000 Small Business (10KSB) U.K. program and a control group of similarly high-growth small business owners.  The results are encouraging. During the pandemic, 68% of 10KSB U.K. alumni changed their business model; 69% introduced new products or services; and many have increased turnover and employment. Small businesses have used their adaptability to develop new and improved products and services to navigate this period of heightened uncertainty and identify new areas for growth. In fact, of the alumni who introduced new products and services, 55% were completely new to the market. We believe that the adaptability of the 10KSB community will be instrumental in building back the U.K. economy.  How are small businesses in the U.K. addressing the widening skill gap caused by the pandemic?  Charlotte Keenan: The emerging skills crisis is the greatest challenge the economy faces in response to the pandemic, but we see small businesses as an integral part of the solution. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re focused on upskilling young people, developing talent and creating jobs that help fill the emerging gaps in the U.K.â\\x80\\x99s transition to a high-skilled economy. The survey found that 83% of 10KSB U.K. alumni have increased the skills of their workforce since the start of the pandemic and 79% have prioritised hiring and developing young talent.  In fact, one of the 10KSB U.K. alumni we spoke with, Lawrie Abercrombie, told us that heâ\\x80\\x99s continually looking for ways to invest in the next generation of talent. His business, Arcanum Information Security, now runs a program to develop junior staff members by providing university students with a placement year and the opportunity to become qualified digital forensics professionals. To date, six of these students have returned to Arcanum as full-time employees following graduation. By upskilling the workforce, Lawrie and other entrepreneurs are creating jobs that are both rewarding and well-rewarded.  The pandemic has also increased the pace of digital adoption across all sectors. How are small businesses adapting to stay competitive?  Charlotte Keenan: Over the last two years, the value and growth potential brought about by digital advances has been immensely magnified. This creates a huge amount of opportunity, but many businesses are still grappling with how to leverage technology to unlock their latent growth. We believe itâ\\x80\\x99s vital for small business leaders to explore how technology can help them to unleash their full potential, regardless of the sector theyâ\\x80\\x99re in. The good news is that weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing a shift amongst the 10KSB U.K. alumni. Survey results revealed that 88% have accelerated changes to their use of digital technologies and 93% use data in their decision making.  How are small businesses driving the agenda on sustainability?  Charlotte Keenan: As well as being fundamental to the U.K.â\\x80\\x99s economic performance, small businesses are driving societal change. Itâ\\x80\\x99s actually one of their top priorities: 81% of alumni told us that social and environmental factors influence their daily decision making.  Take for example, Kathy Caton, founder of Brighton Gin and 10KSB U.K. alumni, whose business is on track to becoming carbon-negative. She aims to limit their carbon footprint at every step of the production and distribution lines, from completing all of their local deliveries via a specially branded e-cargo bike, to using bottles made up of 85% recycled glass. Kathy and many of the other entrepreneurs we spoke to are leading the way when it comes to sustainability because they believe itâ\\x80\\x99s essential for businesses to combine profit with purpose.  To find out more about how small businesses in the U.K. are driving growth, read the 10KSB U.K. impact report, Engines of Growth.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 20 January 2022     Even as oil prices climb higher, the flow of money into new oil and gas projects has stalled as investors increasingly avoid industries that produce fossil fuels and heavy carbon emissions. That breakdown between energy prices and capital expenditures is likely to prop up the cost of a barrel of oil, but it could also help support the transition to low-carbon energy. We spoke with Michele Della Vigna, head of natural resources research in EMEA at Goldman Sachs, to discuss the firmâ\\x80\\x99s outlook for commodity prices as investors increase their focus on climate change.   Your research shows that the link between higher energy prices and capital expenditures has broken down. What severed that connection?  Michele Della Vigna: The capital markets engagement on climate change has reached very high levels. We can measure it in many ways, like climate change shareholder resolutions where the approval rate went from 10% to 40% during the past 10 years. And this drives a complete divergence in the cost of capital of high-carbon versus low-carbon energy projects. We estimate there's been a divergence of 15 percentage points in the cost of capital. This is just to give you an indication of how extreme the impact is of the capital markets focus on climate change.  Because of this shift, the industry finds itself severely capital constrained on traditional hydrocarbon investment in different ways. For smaller exploration and production companies it's about getting financing. For larger integrated oil and gas companies it's about decarbonizing. But either way, none of these companies can scale oil and gas projects the way they used to. And if you think that most companies effectively are forced to embrace a carbon budget, a carbon budget ultimately leads to less oil and gas development, leads to higher hurdle rates, or cost of capital for these projects, and automatically means that whatever the cash flow available may be, capital expenditures are restrained.  This severe restraint on capex in oil and gas is what breaks that historical relationship, and, even in a tight oil and gas market, prevents the creation of new oil and gas fields. That prolongs the up-cycle and brings what we call the â\\x80\\x9crevenge of the old carbon economy,â\\x80\\x9d because this creates supply tightness and ultimately generates what could be one of the most interesting commodity up-cycles we've seen in decades.  Higher oil prices are absolutely consistent with a push for decarbonization that comes from the capital markets.  At the GS Global Strategy Conference, your colleague Jeff Currie said investors are also influenced by the recent history of investment losses in energy. Is that another reason capital isnâ\\x80\\x99t going into this sector?  Michele Della Vigna: It is a very reasonable comment. But interestingly, if you look back to previous recoveries, you used to see a doubling of capex within two or three years. This time around, we think capex in two or three years will barely go up in oil and gas by 20%. So something is not just cyclically but is structurally different here.  Now, there will be other avenues of capex. If you included low-carbon investments, you would see a bit more capex recovery because there is a shift to low carbon but still nothing like the capex increases we've seen in previous up-cycles.  Is this a global issue? Does it break down differently depending on the geography?  Michele Della Vigna: There are geographical differences but bear in mind capital markets are global. The push is stronger in Europe, but it is also felt in the U.S. and in other regions. So although it's true to say that the European energy companies are probably more carbon constrained, so are the U.S. companies where the focus on oil growth is minimal even at an oil price that historically would have led to much more activity.  Even the national oil companies are focusing much less on oil growth and much more on the development of low-carbon businesses. So I think this is a global process. It has some regional bias, but it's a global process.  Oil prices are high and these companies arenâ\\x80\\x99t spending on capex like they once did. Is the upshot a surge in share buybacks and dividends?  Michele Della Vigna: Yes, and let me take it perhaps one step back. So we've discussed how focused the capital markets are on decarbonization. On the other side, I think we should quickly touch on how little policy coordination there is on a global basis around decarbonization. The providers of capital are pushing very strongly for decarbonization but the policymakers are effectively struggling to agree on a global framework on decarbonization, carbon pricing, etc., which leads to a period of extreme carbon uncertainty.  The result is that global sectors which are very carbon intensive delay and reduce investment decisions because of this uncertainty. We've shown in our carbonomics research how sectors like shipping, oil and gas, cement, steel, are all investing 40% less of their cash flow than they have done in their long-term history. So I don't think this is just unique to oil and gas. All of these global sectors which are carbon intensive, in the wake of uncertainty on the policy environment, are just delaying investment decisions.  If you reinvest 40% less of your cash flow, the result is you've got a lot more money to use for balance sheet strengtheningâ\\x80\\x94but that has already largely happenedâ\\x80\\x94dividends and buybacks, which clearly are increasing, and at some point M&A. You use that money to consolidate the industry rather than to build a new capacity, and I think this is what is going to characterize a lot of these carbon-heavy sectors until global policy starts to align in a stronger way.  This suggests higher prices for energy in the longer term. Does that help or hurt the transition to low carbon energy?    Michele Della Vigna: It definitely helps to accelerate the energy transition. The more expensive the hydrocarbons, the cheaper the low-carbon alternative becomes. To give you an idea, our carbonomics cost curve came down last year by 12%, almost entirely driven by the higher cost of the traditional hydrocarbon-based technologies. So it does help from a relative perspective, but it also creates affordability problems which could generate political backlash. That is the riskâ\\x80\\x94political instability and the consumer effectively suffering from this cost inflation.  But from a pure economic perspective, higher oil and gas prices accelerate the energy transition. They just do it in a way that can be disruptive from a social perspective.

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 13 January 2022     The U.S. economy rebounded quickly in 2021, as Goldman Sachs Research predicted, but what will 2022 bring? David Mericle, chief U.S. economist, and Alec Phillips, chief U.S. political economist, highlight some of the key questions for 2022.  Fiscal spending was a key source of support for economic growth in 2021. How will spending change in 2022?  Alec Phillips: In short, itâ\\x80\\x99s going to become a headwind relative to the tailwind it was last year. We expect Congress to raise spending in 2022 but the impact is likely to be modest. We recently downgraded our economic forecast for the first three quarters of 2022 due to the lack of support in the Senate for the House-passed Build Back Better bill and the near-term spending it includes. It also now looks like Congress will allow the expanded child tax credit to lapse. That said, Congress is likely to approve some new spending, though most of it would occur over the next several years. So under our revised fiscal forecast, the decline in fiscal support in 2022 is now even larger. We estimate that the boost to the level of GDP from the various pandemic fiscal packages peaked at just under 8pp in the second quarter of last year and has now fallen to around 5pp. We estimate it will decline further to 1.5-2% by the fourth quarter of this year.  So what will happen to U.S. GDP this year as a result?  David Mericle: While consensus expects GDP growth of 3.4% in 2022 on a Q4/Q4 basisâ\\x80\\x94and the median FOMC participant expects 4%â\\x80\\x94we donâ\\x80\\x99t believe that GDP growth will meet consensus expectations. Our forecast is lower at 2.4% on a Q4/Q4 basis or 3.5% on a full-year basis. The deceleration is likely to be sharpest in Q1, when the omicron variant will likely weigh on service sector spending and labor supply, and it may also worsen global supply chain disruptions. For 2022 as a whole, the main headwind is the large fiscal pullback that we have anticipated since the start of 2021. As we have noted in our 2022 outlook, we expect three positive growth impulsesâ\\x80\\x94further reopening of the service sector as health risks decline, a boost to consumer spending from pent-up savings and wealth effects, and inventory restockingâ\\x80\\x94to offset the fiscal drag by enough to keep growth above trend this year but not by enough to meet consensus expectations.  You mentioned labor supply. With labor demand still strong, where do you see unemployment heading in 2022?  David Mericle: The unemployment rate fell quickly last year and our expectation is that it should continue to fall in 2022. In early 2021, we took our unemployment rate forecast far below consensus after the Democratsâ\\x80\\x99 win in the Georgia Senate elections made a large fiscal package likely. We stuck with that forecast when the initial post-vaccination pace of labor market recovery proved disappointing, because we thought that strong labor demand would eventually produce large job gains and suspected that enhanced unemployment benefits were temporarily delaying the return to work. We later confirmed that this indeed was the case by comparing states that ended these benefits early with those that didnâ\\x80\\x99t. With labor demand still red hot and enhanced unemployment benefits now expired, we expect the unemployment rate to fall to a 50-year low of 3.4% by the end of 2022. Labor force participation is likely to remain below the pre-pandemic trend, though this looks largely voluntary or structural.  And what about inflation? Will the current surge continue?  David Mericle: The current inflation surge is likely to get worse before it gets better, but by the end of the year we expect core PCE inflation to fall below 3%, though CPI is likely to remain quite a bit higher. Admittedly, the key driver of our forecastâ\\x80\\x94the partial resolution of supply-demand imbalances in the durable goods sectorâ\\x80\\x94is hard to time, and omicron is likely to make things worse in the near term. Surveys of businesses and workers suggest that most expect wage growth to run at around 4% this year, which would be consistent with inflation coming down toward the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s 2% goal, though the latest wage numbers look much stronger than that.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 23 December 2021     What's causing workers to drop out of the labor force continues to be a topic of debate among investors and policy makers. In the U.S., the labor force participation rate stood at 61.8% in November, compared with 63.3% in February 2020. We spoke with Daan Struyven, senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, to discuss the firmâ\\x80\\x99s outlook on U.S. and worldwide labor participation.  Your research suggests that U.S. government support for households and businesses accounts for about half of the shortfall in labor participation since the start of the pandemic. Other studies have come up with a smaller number. Why are your findings different?  Daan Struyven: What makes our methodology unique is that we use the cross-country differences. The pattern we find is that countries where fiscal support is very strong are countries where the participation rate has generally underperformed.  The most notable case is Chile, where not only was fiscal support very strong, but households were also able to withdraw liquidity from their pension funds as the rules changed, and Chileâ\\x80\\x99s participation rate remains five percentage points below its 2019 level. Our estimates essentially reflect this strong correlation across countries between high fiscal support and relatively weak labor-force participation.  The research points out that just because fiscal support appears to have reduced the labor-participation rate doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean it has been bad for the economy. Can you explain why that is?  Daan Struyven: Itâ\\x80\\x99s true that the participation rateâ\\x80\\x99s recovery has probably been a bit slower as a result of fiscal supportâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s what our findings suggest. At the same time, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think itâ\\x80\\x99s obvious that there has necessarily been a negative impact on broader measures of wellbeing.  Fiscal support really allowed people to replace the income that they lost from not working. You had a replacement of labor income with transfer income. And that allowed people to continue to consume, which in turn supported labor demand. You avoided, if you want, a negative feedback loop.  The second potential benefit from a broader wellbeing perspective is that it allowed people to still maintain their consumption while not working, in a period when working, especially before the vaccines were there, could be particularly dangerous for some vulnerable workers in high-contact sectors. Or, alternatively, where people had to take care of children or the elderly. The opportunity cost of time off from working was presumably quite high for many individuals.  Goldman Sachs research signals that the form of labor support also partly explains why the labor supply in the U.S. has lagged behind some other countries. Can you explain why that is?  Daan Struyven: Between the U.S. system, where you replace income through unemployment benefits, and the European system, where, essentially, workers stay on the payroll, but the government pays around 80% of your prior wage while you work not at all or work reduced hours, the one thing in common is that the two systems provide income replacement. The key difference is: do you maintain the relationship between the worker and the firm?  In the U.S. case, people are unemployed and the relationship is at least temporarily broken. Whereas in Europe or other countries, for instance Japan or Australia, the relationship was intact. And so that meant when demand rebounded and when activity rebounded it was easier for workers to pick up the work at their employer where they were still on the payroll. In the U.S., if youâ\\x80\\x99re not on the payroll any more, it might make it harder to find a new job. The companies may have reorganized themselves, they may have invested in new technology.  Empirically we find that the system where a lot of workers stay on the job-retention schemes is associated with better labor-force participation performance.  Does the research indicate which system or policyâ\\x80\\x94unemployment benefits versus job-retention systemsâ\\x80\\x94has been better for the economy overall?  Daan Struyven: Itâ\\x80\\x99s still a bit early to tell. Weâ\\x80\\x99re starting to see signs that the U.S. labor-participation rate is rebounding. Some of the job retention schemes in Europe are still in place. You still donâ\\x80\\x99t know what the full effects will be once those schemes end.  We find at the moment that job-retention schemes are associated with better labor-force participation performance. On the other hand, what we also find in the data is that labor-productivity growth in the U.S. has outperformed, perhaps because U.S. firms continue to produce a lot with a smaller number of workers. A second potential benefit is that if the post-pandemic economy looks structurally very different, with more jobs in some industries and fewer jobs in others, then actually there might be benefits to the U.S. system because you allow people to switch from old jobs to new jobs. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a potentially a reallocation benefit.  Do you think the U.S. participation rate will get back to where it was before the pandemic, and, if so, when do you think it will have recovered?  Daan Struyven: We look for a partial rebound (see chart above), but we think the participation rate will remain structurally below its pre-pandemic trend in the U.S. The main reason is that job losses have likely triggered permanent exits from the labor force in the U.S., especially among workers who are near the retirement age. But we do look for a partial rebound as some of the factors Iâ\\x80\\x99ve mentioned that are now weighing on participation diminish in importance. The fiscal effect will probably diminish as some of the savings that people built up are partially depleted. The negative effect of virus fears on participation that we also document here will probably also diminish as hopefully the virus situation improves, especially after an Omicron wave.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 09 December 2021     Affluent women are poised to fuel the next wave of growth in the U.S. wealth management industry. We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Meena Flynn, co-head of Global Private Wealth Management in the Consumer and Wealth Management Division, to discuss the recent launch of In the Lead, a platform for ultra-high-net-worth women with curated advice, insights and networking opportunities.  Can you start by describing In the Lead and why the firm decided to launch it?  Meena Flynn: In the Lead is a new way for women clients to experience private wealth management. The program consists of thought leadership, curated insights and resources, as well as an exclusive community and network for these clients. It was created based on what we were hearing from our clients and our own research. And while weâ\\x80\\x99ve always worked closely with our women clients, many of them were looking for a more tailored experience to help cater to their unique needs.  So what does the current wealth management landscape look like and how do you expect that might change?  Meena Flynn: Over the next decade, U.S. affluent women are expected to control an unprecedented amount of assetsâ\\x80\\x94as much as $30 trillion, according to a McKinsey study, considering demographic shifts in the baby boomer generation. Given that women tend to outlive men by about five years, we expect men will cede control of these assets to their female spouses who tend to be younger and live longer. And one of the things thatâ\\x80\\x99s happened historically is that 70% of women change their financial advisor within one year of their spouse or partner passing. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s usually because they werenâ\\x80\\x99t part of the financial planning or didnâ\\x80\\x99t feel connected to the advisor.  More women are financially savvy and are the family breadwinners. How do you see growth in that segment shaping wealth management?  Meena Flynn: Along with these demographic changes, married affluent women are making financial decisions for the householdâ\\x80\\x94over the last five years the number of women doing so went up roughly 30%. And while these are U.S.-centric stats, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing similar trends across the globe.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 11 November 2021     At a recent Goldman Sachs Asset Management Forum, Katie Koch, co-head of Goldman Sachs' Fundamental Equity business, spoke with Robin Diamonte, chief investment officer of Raytheon Technologies, about her career, changes in the retirement landscape and what itâ\\x80\\x99s like to manage one of the largest corporate pension plans in the U.S. with more than $100 billion in assets.  What follows are excerpts from their conversation.  Katie Koch: Youâ\\x80\\x99re widely known for being on the cutting edge of innovation in terms of driving better outcomes for individual investors. For example, you were early to add risk parity, alpha overlays and hedge fund strategies to pension plans. What drives you to be innovative?  Robin Diamonte: Some of it had to do with my mentor, Britt Harris (currently CEO and CIO of UTIMCO) with whom I worked closely with at Verizon. Britt was always looking for the next thing and inspired me to do so as well. In our world, you need to be innovative and look for the next source of alpha because every great idea eventually gets arbitrage by the marketâ\\x80\\x94and then the returns arenâ\\x80\\x99t there anymore.  Katie Koch: One of your innovative ideas was to add risk parity strategies to your investments. How do you think these strategies have held up?  Robin Diamonte: Risk parity strategies are doing exactly what they were designed to do. If cash isnâ\\x80\\x99t the best performing asset class and there are no significant valuation issues, then risk parity will provide better risk-adjusted results than a 60% stocks/40% bonds portfolio over the long term. I think some people may have been disappointed with risk parity returns because they expected the strategy to outperform equity, private equity and private debt. Risk parity strategies are one component our multi-asset class investment allocation, which makes up 10% to 15% percent of the portfolio.  Katie Koch: And what are some of the emerging investment areas that you're excited about?  Robin Diamonte: This year, we created an opportunistic bucket where we invest â\\x80\\x9cflexible capitalâ\\x80\\x9d of up to $2 billion. In the past, we sometimes passed on opportunities because there was no clean bucket to put it in. So we carved out an allocation that will be measured on a longer-term basis. The return target is to outperform our long-term expected return on assets by a couple of percentage points. So we're looking at opportunities such as digital technology, private debt, frontier emerging markets, as well investment themes that are tied to potentially large future trends.  Katie Koch: Letâ\\x80\\x99s pivot to your thoughts on the retirement plan landscape. The industry has largely phased out traditional defined benefit pensions in favor of defined contribution plans. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s forced individual investors to make their own investment decisions with their retirement savings, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. But youâ\\x80\\x99ve helped make DC plans more like traditional pension plans. Can you expand on that?  Robin Diamonte: I think DB plans are a better retirement strategy than DC plans over the long term given the professional management and mortality pooling. But DB plans were created when companies had to pay out benefits for only five to 10 years after retirement, not 20 to 40 years. In the mid-2000s, we saw a lot of companies and our peers close their DB plans and shift employee retirement to DC plans. After the financial crisis we started looking at how we could provide guaranteed lifetime income to our employees in the DC plan. So today, when someone joins the companyâ\\x80\\x99s DC plan, the default investment option is a low-cost passively managed target date fund that eventually turns into a guaranteed lifetime portfolio. When participants reach age 48, their assets begin a glide path, or phase-in, of the secure income annuitized portfolio, making incremental annuity purchases that end at age 60, when the portfolio is fully guaranteed. The portfolio maintains a growth orientation so that the annually guaranteed income can increase even in retirement. The strategy provides both controls, since the employee always has access to their plan balance but also has security with guaranteed lifetime income.  Katie Koch: Goldman Sachs recently announced the acquisition of a European asset manager called NN Investment Partners. As we work through our own integration of the two companies, we would love to hear your thoughts about the merger of Raytheon and United Technologies, which closed in 2020. You were the CIO of United Technologies at the time and were responsible for integrating the companiesâ\\x80\\x99 pension plans. How has that integration gone and is there any advice you can share on best practices?  Robin Diamonte: I think the advice on merging is to start as early as you can before the transaction closes. Something that Britt Harris told me years ago was to honor the past. Really understand the people and the past organization: what policies and practices do they have; what things are done differently and why; and then have an open mind about the integration and implement the best practices of each firm.   Katie Koch: A key part of our culture as investors is to be humble and foster a growth mindset. So we love to ask very successful people about their own mistakes and what theyâ\\x80\\x99ve learned from them. Can you give us an example of something that perhaps didn't go the way you wanted it to and what you learned from it?  Robin Diamonte: I've been at this for a long time, so Iâ\\x80\\x99ve made a lot of mistakes. But I would say that not rebalancing to your strategic policies is one that comes to mind. I tell people all the time, you cannot time the markets. The tech bubble, the global financial crisis and the pandemic, for example, all felt like unique investing periods at the time. We always rebalanced to our strategic asset allocation during each of those times but at a cautious pace. I think that if we had rebalanced a little faster, we would have been slightly more successful. It's just like de-risking a portfolio. When your funded status and interest rates are going up, you want to ride it out rather than de-risk and take returns off the table. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all psychological and you need to stick to your strategy even if it seems painful.  Katie Koch: Robin, youâ\\x80\\x99ve been very open about your sexual orientation and ahead of other leaders in our industry. How did you make the decision to come out when you did and how has doing so impacted your career?  Robin Diamonte: What you have to do is to trust your instincts. I remember in the old days I wouldn't come out to people until I felt like they knew me and my work ethic. But then at some point in my career, something clicked and I realized I was spending so much energyâ\\x80\\x94at work and in my private lifeâ\\x80\\x94not being my authentic self and not bringing my true self to work. Trying to pretend to be someone who you're not wastes so much energy that you could be using more productively and inhibits you from building friendships and close relationships with your peers and your coworkers. It impacts your mental health and your effectiveness at your job. I think being openly gay in some respects, also helps to educate people and normalizes our differences. Luckily, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think it affected my career. People just accepted me for who I was because I didnâ\\x80\\x99t define myself that way. If I had a list of 10 qualities that I thought defined me, being a lesbian wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be one of those 10 things. If a person feels comfortable in their own body and proud of who they are, then itâ\\x80\\x99s so much easier to come out and for people to accept it.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 11 November 2021     Is there a case for dropping China from emerging market (EM) indices? We sat down with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Timothy Moe and Sunil Koul to discuss the drivers behind the growing debate to invest in EMs, without China.  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s driving the discussions among investors to separate China from the rest of their emerging market equity allocations?  Timothy Moe: First of all, a key factor is China's significant market size and its rising dominance in the EM benchmarks. Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s weight in the MSCI EM index has roughly doubled over the past five years, from about 20% in 2015 to a peak of 43% in Q4 2020. And we expect Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s weight in global and EM benchmarks to increase in the coming years, especially as index providers begin raising the weight of mainland China stocks, known as â\\x80\\x9cA shares.â\\x80\\x9d With the rising dominance of China in EM benchmarks, EM investors inherently have to take a large exposure in China. Secondly, idiosyncratic factors, including geopolitical concerns such as U.S.-China tensions and Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s recent regulatory crackdowns, have driven sharp underperformance of Chinese equities versus other EMs. This has fueled the need for investors to better manage China risk and highlighted the merits of separating China from the rest of the emerging markets.  Just how large is EM ex-China as a separate market or index?  Sunil Koul: EM ex-China as a separate market or index is quite large in terms of its capitalization and offers significant depth and liquidity. Within the MSCI EM index, EM ex-China currently includes about half of the 1,400 stocks and two-thirds of the index capitalization. And within a universe of larger-cap listed stocks globally (measured as having at least $2 billion of market capitalization), the U.S. market, not surprisingly, has the highest number of larger cap stocks while the EM ex-China region has the third highest number, with about 1,200 larger-caps stocks. In terms of liquidity, more than half of these larger-cap stocks in EM ex-China trade at least $10 million a day.  Why would investors opt to invest in EM ex-China?     Sunil Koul: While an EM ex-China index is less levered to China's growth, it offers different market, sector and macro exposures to investors. EM ex-China, for example, has greater exposures to the tech and semiconductor sectors than China. It's also more sensitive to U.S. tightening and commodities than Chinese equities. The benefits of portfolio diversification can have a significant impact on returns as shown by the wide disparity in performance of China and the rest of EM this year.  So how would a separate asset class for EM ex-China equities impact investors and their allocations?  Timothy Moe: With a separate asset class for EM ex-China equities, asset managers could control their China risk better, as historically they would have to take a large exposure in China given its index dominance. Against the current backdrop of geopolitical concerns and domestic regulatory risks in China, having a separate asset class will also allow global equity managers to create more efficient portfolios. In fact, our own analysis finds that the optimal portfoliosâ\\x80\\x94based on the efficient frontier created by separating China from the EM benchmark and having separate allocations to China and EM ex-Chinaâ\\x80\\x94would have offered higher returns or a reduction in risk compared with ones created by using EM as a single asset class. More broadly, we could also see greater allocation of resources towards EM ex-China markets, more EM ex-China financial products and greater investment flows, which bodes well for the asset management industry.  The last time a dominant country was separated from an equity index in the region was in January 2001 when the MSCI launched its Asia ex-Japan index. Are there any lessons learned?  Timothy Moe: Japan serves as a useful case study for how the investment terrain could change if investors separate China from the rest of the emerging market index. Both Japan and the region (ex-China) continued to receive cumulative net inflows and at a fairly consistent, roughly 60%/40% proportion. Based on the experience of how indices evolved and portfolio flows progressed following separation of the rest of Asian equity markets from Japan, it appears likely that both China and EM ex-China can be viable indices and attract investment flows with no cannibalization effect.       20 October 2021 Goldman Sachs Research EM Ex-China as a Separate Equity Asset Class Read Report\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 04 November 2021     At the Goldman Sachs Asset Management Forum, Steve Rattner, chairman and CEO of Willett Advisors, spoke with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Katie Koch, co-head of the Fundamental Equity business, and Goldman Sachs' Nora Creedon, an investor in private real estate, about China, U.S. deficits and wage inflation. Rattner manages the personal and philanthropic investments of Michael Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies, and previously served as counselor to the secretary of the treasury in former President Barack Obama's administration and as lead auto adviser, where he led the successful restructuring of the auto industry during the 2008 financial crisis. Ahead, a few excerpts from their conversation.  Nora Creedon: Steve, youâ\\x80\\x99re widely known as a China bull, having said in the past that China is one of the most exciting places to invest, despite the lack of transparency. What do you make of the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s regulatory crackdown and recent concerns about the property sector? Has it affected your appetite to invest there?  Steve Rattner: Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been investing in China for a long time and have found it to be one of the most dynamic, driven andâ\\x80\\x94ironically, given its Communist rootsâ\\x80\\x94capitalistic countries in the world. The reason Chinese equities have traded at a substantial discount to developed market equities is because of the unknown risks around its political system. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s playing out now. Not only is the government responding to the growing power and wealth thatâ\\x80\\x99s been created in the technology sector and others, but there are rising tensions with the U.S. over trade, data security and the South China Sea. Meanwhile, President Xi Jinping is pivoting away from policies aimed at lifting people out of poverty to policies aimed at leveling the playing field for individuals. All of these changes are forcing us to rethink how and where we invest in China, although I fundamentally still believe that China will remain a market-based economy and an attractive place to invest.  Katie Koch: Youâ\\x80\\x99ve been vocal about the high level of deficits in the U.S. Even today, there are proposals that could add another $3 trillion in new spending to those deficits. Where do you come out on the absolute level of deficits and what do you see as some of the dangers?  Steve Rattner: Iâ\\x80\\x99ve long been a deficit hawk, but itâ\\x80\\x99s worth noting that there are different types of hawks. Some people believe that markets will, at some point, back up and revolt against the level of debt, forcing the U.S. into a position where it will have trouble borrowing. I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe that. In 2011, for example, when the U.S. was close to defaulting on its debt, investors piled into Treasuries as a safe haven. What I find sad today is that our countryâ\\x80\\x99s deficits represent an intergenerational transfer from our children to us. Sure, weâ\\x80\\x99ll continue to roll over the U.S. debt from year to year, but we still have to pay interest. Interest rates are low right now, but eventually rates will rise and the interest payments on the larger deficits will create more pressure on the federal budget, reducing the available funds for other priorities.  Katie Koch: One of the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s priorities, of course, is to speed up the transition to clean energy. Itâ\\x80\\x99s clear that capital is being catalyzed behind the solutions providers for a transition to net zero. Do you also think levying a carbon tax would be a good approach?  Steve Rattner: From a policy point of view, a simple solution would be to tax carbon at its real costs. There are huge externalities, as economists would say, of the damage that carbon causes the environment as well as the costs to clear up the damage. The people who use carbon should pay for it. Put a carbon tax on it and let the market sort it out.  Katie Koch: Letâ\\x80\\x99s pivot a bit to discuss income inequality. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a rapid level of wealth creation over the past year due to the rise in the capital markets, which has also left part of American society behind. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve also effectively seen an increase in the minimum wage through stimulus, which is resulting in higher wages. From our perspective, we believe we could be on the precipice of a redistribution cycle from capital to labor that could result in inflationary pressures. In fact, there are some people in this country who would argue that we have to run deficits to address income inequality, butâ\\x80\\x94even as a deficit hawkâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99ve also said that the U.S. has a challenge to solve with income inequality. So what solutions would you propose to address that?  Steve Rattner: We absolutely should be implementing some of the spending proposals that are being considered. Recent studies show that the U.S. still ranks at the bottom of every developed country in terms of providing social benefits, such as paid sick leave or childcare. We need to address these issues, but we also need to be careful with how much weâ\\x80\\x99re spending, how quickly and how responsibly. Of course, these proposals will have to be paid for with higher taxes, primarily on the wealthy, but I believe everyone should do their part. President Bidenâ\\x80\\x99s proposal to only raise taxes for households with incomes of more than $400,000 excludes 98% of the country. To your point on higher wages, we also expect that higher wages will create cost pressures, raising concerns for companies about their profit margins. At some point, however, the higher costs will translate into higher interest rates. And thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I worry about. The market is heavily driven by interest rates. Higher interest rates can hobble this market.  Nora Creedon: One of the industries that is benefiting from wealth accumulation is the housing sector. Do you get nervous with the current pace of home price appreciation or is this a sign that the middle class is accumulating more wealth?  Steve Rattner: What weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing in housing today is almost the exactly the opposite of what we saw during the great financial crisis, when we were building too many houses. Since the GFC, we have underbuilt housing relative to the rate of household formation. Today, people have more moneyâ\\x80\\x94incomes went up last year during the pandemicâ\\x80\\x94and with interest rates at all-time lows, people want to buy houses. But even with interest rates at all-time lows, housing unaffordability is at a 10-year high. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the worst itâ\\x80\\x99s been in 10 years. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a real problem.  Nora Creedon: And from an investment perspective, whatâ\\x80\\x99s your view on real estate and on real assets?  Steve Rattner: We like real assets and have been investing in real estate, especially in the last year and a half, particularly in hospitality, where through external managers, weâ\\x80\\x99ve bought assets during the pandemic that weâ\\x80\\x99ve already sold for two to three times what we paid for it. Real estate, done properly, is a reasonably stable returning asset class where you can get low- to mid-double-digit returns.  Nora Creedon: Steve, before you started your investment banking career, you worked as a journalist for The New York Times, mostly as an economic correspondent in New York, London and Washington. What do you make of the evolution of journalism where journalists can make significantly more money by publishing content that goes directly to consumers? What does that do the world of journalism?  Steve Rattner: Weâ\\x80\\x99re in the golden age of media where people have never had so much access to so many different kinds of content without gatekeepersâ\\x80\\x94without three networks or one newspaper deciding what people can watch or read. From a societal point of view, the democratization of mediaâ\\x80\\x94where anybody can write anything, from anywhereâ\\x80\\x94is a wonderful thing. It has some implications for traditional media, but there is still a need and desire on the part of consumers for someone to collect content, organize and fact check the content. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s being squeezed out, unfortunately, are the local, smaller papers in cities that donâ\\x80\\x99t have the resources. Weâ\\x80\\x99re going to see a lot of cities in the U.S. without a daily, local newsletterâ\\x80\\x94but thatâ\\x80\\x99s also part of capitalism.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 28 October 2021     Rising price pressures are raising doubts about whether the surge in prices is temporary or something more permanent. We sat down with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s chief U.S. economist David Mericle for his latest views on the inflation outlook.  David, can you walk us through your forecasts on inflation and where you see it heading into year end?  David Mericle: So we're now at a three-decade high on core inflation and I expect it to get worse before it gets better. I have core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation ending the year at 4.3% and staying in the 4% neighborhood through the first quarter of 2022. After that, I expect inflation to come down pretty sharply in Q2 and Q3 and to reach 2.15% year-on-year by the very end of 2022. That's partly just because of extreme base effects dropping out next spring. We're not going to see used car prices rise another 40% next year, for example. But it's also driven by our assumption that we will see enough resolution of supply-side problems and enough moderation of demand for goods as fiscal support fades to rebuild inventories. That should then cause durable goods prices to revert a little bit back toward pre-pandemic trends from what are now pretty lofty levels.  So why do you expect prices to partially revert back to trend on durable goods?  David Mericle: Well, for things like used cars, prices are flexible in both directions. And once you can actually get your hands on a new car, no one is going to pay the same price for a used car as for a new car, as they are now. In other categories, such as new cars, furniture and appliances, a lot of what has been counted as abnormally high inflation this year is actually an elimination of discounting. If you're a retailer, for example, and you have limited inventory and are bound to sell out, you don't put anything on sale. As long as supply-demand imbalances are eventually resolved, prices on some items like used cars partially normalize, and normal sales and discounting come back on other goods where shortages have widened retail margins this year, we should see some one-time deflationary payback next year for this one-time inflationary surge this year. So this is the distinguishing feature of our inflation forecast next year. I expect these supply-constrained durable goods categories to go from contributing about 140 basis points at the end of this year to being a big drag of 60 basis points at the end of next year, a swing of about 200 basis points. That's the main reason we expect core PCE inflation to fall from the low 4s at the end of 2021 to the low 2s at the end of 2022. Basically, we're assuming that very stretched durable goods prices this year mean payback next year and probably even a little into 2023. In contrast, the break-even marketâ\\x80\\x94which reflects investorsâ\\x80\\x99 inflation expectations in the Treasury marketsâ\\x80\\x94seems to be assuming this means momentum, not payback, for next year. Admittedly, itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to know.  Are there other sectors that could still see higher prices?  David Mericle: The drop-off of prices on the goods side will be partially offset by faster inflation in some services categories. In particular, shelter is going to keep accelerating, due to labor market improvement and spillover effects from this huge boom in home prices that we've seen. And prices will keep accelerating in low-paying sectors like restaurants where wage costs have grown very quickly this year. A lot of forecasters have suddenly begun emphasizing these more persistent service-sector pressures after the September CPI report but none of this is really new. We've been predicting and writing about both of these trends since the spring and none of it is actually controversial. I think the controversy and uncertainty for 2022 are really more on the goods side.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 21 October 2021     After most of the large banks reported their quarterly earnings last week, we sat down with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Richard Ramsden, Business Unit Leader of the Financials Group, to discuss the implications for markets.  The latest earnings results from the nationâ\\x80\\x99s biggest banks were relatively strong. What are your key takeaways?  Richard Ramsden: First, the markets have been very focused on loan growth as an indicator of economic growth, and this was the first quarter this year where we saw both corporate and consumer loan growth stabilize and pick up on an underlying basis. We estimate that corporate loan growth grew about 2% on a quarter-to-quarter basis while consumer loan growth grew by 2.5% to 3%, driven by strength in auto lending and credit card spending. Moreover, the outlook for loan growth and credit card spending was also constructive heading into next year. Second, we saw considerable strength in banks' capital markets businesses, both in trading and primary activity. We had been expecting strong activity, but the magnitude of results were better than expected. Essentially, investors are viewing banksâ\\x80\\x99 third-quarter activity as a reflection of how much the pool of capital has grown since the third quarter 2019. We estimate that capital markets revenue industrywide could normalize at levels that are 15% to 20% higher than 2019 levels, due to stronger equity capital markets and M&A activity. We also saw pristine credit quality from the banksâ\\x80\\x94the best in 30 years, in factâ\\x80\\x94and the outlook is benign given that consumers and corporates are in strong financial shape.  So how sustainable do youâ\\x80\\x94and investorsâ\\x80\\x94think capital markets activity will be going forward?  Richard Ramsden: Most analyst modelsâ\\x80\\x94including oursâ\\x80\\x94are building in a 10% to 15% fade in activity as we head into 2022. Having said that, whatâ\\x80\\x99s clear is that M&A activity is likely to remain elevated. Keep in mind that around 50% of M&A fees this year have been driven by financial sponsors which, because of the amount of dry powder they hold, signal that activity is likely to continue. Clearly the pie has grown relative to where we were in 2019 because markets are bigger. But increasingly that pie is concentrated among fewer players with more pricing power at the margin. So while weâ\\x80\\x99re likely to see a drop-off in activity, I think the market is too pessimistic on the speed and magnitude of that drop-off.  In your conversations with management teams, how are they responding to post-pandemic concerns around supply chain disruptions, inflation and wages?  Richard Ramsden: Banks agree that supply chain disruptions are impacting companies across industries and geographies, but there is some divergence of views in how long those disruptions will persist. For example, some of the regional banksâ\\x80\\x94which are more exposed to the auto industry and other manufacturing sectorsâ\\x80\\x94expect the supply chain issues will persist for longer. Overall, the supply chain delays are hampering companiesâ\\x80\\x99 abilities to rebuild inventories, leading to weaker loan demands. That said, most companies expect the supply chain issues should be resolved by the middle of next year, which should also boost loan growth as companies look to fund growth in working capital. On the inflation side, most banks have already increased average wages for their tellers and some entry level workers due to the shortage in labor markets. While most banks believe some inflation issues, especially in labor markets, will persist, they are optimistic about the speed at which these issues will be resolved.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 14 October 2021     Amid rising worries over inflation and rates, investors are anxiously assessing the impact for stocks. We sat down with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Ben Snider who shared his thoughts on what he sees as the biggest concerns for equity investors, the interplay between rates and equities, and what to expect for the upcoming earnings season.  Ben, how significant has the low-rate environment been to your constructive view on equities, and how does that view change, if at all, as we see real rates rise?  Ben Snider: Declining rates have certainly given a major boost to equities, which you can see clearly in valuations. If you look at absolute metrics, such as price-to-earnings, price-to-book and EV-to-EBITDA, valuations seem extremely high, ranking between the 95th and 99th historical percentiles. But when you adjust for todayâ\\x80\\x99s low interest rates, equities actually look more attractively valued than historical averages. Now as rates begin to rise, valuations potentially come under pressure, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s heightened by the fact that in recent years markets and portfolios have become concentrated in secular growth stocks that are particularly rate-sensitive. So itâ\\x80\\x99s not surprising that the most common question we get is: â\\x80\\x9cHow high would rates need to rise before they hurt equity investors?â\\x80\\x9d In our view, rates would have to rise dramatically to threaten equity valuations. As an example, if you were to keep the current S&P 500 P/E multiple constant at around 20x, weâ\\x80\\x99d have to see the nominal yield on the 10-year Treasury jump to roughly 2.3% for equity valuations to rank above their historical averages on a relative basis.  Assuming we donâ\\x80\\x99t see such dramatic rate increases, what else could shift the needle on equitiesâ\\x80\\x99 attractiveness?  Ben Snider: Besides the level of rates, the volatility of yields is also important dynamic. Historically, when rates rise by two or more standard deviations in a month, equities react poorly. We saw this play out in February and March, as well as in recent weeks. So going forward, we would expect rates to rise but would be more focused on the volatility than the level of the rate increase. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also important to consider why rates are rising. If itâ\\x80\\x99s because growth expectations are improving, equities generally do pretty well in that type of environment. But whatâ\\x80\\x99s troubling investors today is the expectation of Fed tightening which, in turn, is lifting real rates. So even if rates are rising, that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean that equities will decline in absolute terms. In fact, we expect equitiesâ\\x80\\x94driven by earnings growthâ\\x80\\x94will continue to appreciate alongside modestly higher yields. Consider this: Corporate earnings have accounted for all of the year-to-date S&P 500 returns.  So as we kick off another U.S. earnings season, what are you expecting?  Ben Snider: The earnings reports themselves should be pretty strong, with bottom-up consensus numbers forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 27%. Itâ\\x80\\x99s pretty amazing to be discussing concerns around the earnings outlook when youâ\\x80\\x99re expecting that kind of growth, but the reality is that itâ\\x80\\x99s a sharp deceleration from the 88% earnings growth reported in the second quarter. Analysts have been very conservative with their estimates given the high levels of macro uncertainty and cautious management guidance, and bottom-up consensus is actually forecasting 50 basis points of profit margin contraction this quarter compared to the last, which we think highlights a key focus for this earnings season: Input cost pressures. Investors and corporate management teams weâ\\x80\\x99ve spoken with have been very focused on factors related to input costs, from labor supply and wages to energy input costs to supply chain problems. The real question this season is how companies are dealing with these pressures. Because analysts have set a low bar, in my view, we do expect a good amount of â\\x80\\x9cbeatsâ\\x80\\x9d, although we expect the stock price reactions to be muted with investors more focused on management guidance.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 08 October 2021     Telecom, cable, media and mobility companies saw a surge of growth when the pandemic began, but how are they faring now that people arenâ\\x80\\x99t quarantined at home? We sat down with with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Brett Feldman, Stephen Laszczyk and Eric Sheridan following the firmâ\\x80\\x99s 30th Annual Communacopia Conference to discuss what industry leaders are saying.   Cable and telecom sectors were among the biggest beneficiaries during the pandemic. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s their outlook as economies reopen?  Brett Feldman: The major cable companies have benefited from strong growth as people relied on broadband connections for work, school and entertainment during the COVID-19 lockdowns. But the companies signaled that they expected growth to moderate in the third quarter. So investors are asking whether this is simply a natural moderation of growth following a period of overwhelmingly strong demand or whether weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing a shift in the competitive landscape. Telecommunications firms, for example, are emerging as a competitor, as they look to supply fiber networks to peopleâ\\x80\\x99s homes. Overall, however, the cable companies highlighted underlying growth opportunities: Broadband is generally underpenetrated in many markets, providing further room for upside, and the management teams at the conference highlighted the significant network investments to deliver gigabyte-capable speeds and new products, such as in-home mesh Wi-Fi and free streaming hardware.  What about the outlook for media companiesâ\\x80\\x94whatâ\\x80\\x99s the appetite for streaming services?  Brett Feldman: Several media companies reported some deceleration in the growth of their streaming subscribers. So the question again for investors is whether this deceleration is a signal that the overall market for streaming is going to continue to moderate as people come out of lockdown, or if weâ\\x80\\x99re just starting to learn more about the seasonal cadence of these products as we move into a potentially more normal operating environment.  Letâ\\x80\\x99s talk about the flip slideâ\\x80\\x94how are industries dependent on in-person traffic faring?  Stephen Laszczyk: Live-events companies signaled theyâ\\x80\\x99re continuing to march ahead toward normalcy, albeit having to adapt to some of the curveballs thrown by the delta variant. Demand looks strong on both sides of the ticket: Artists, for their part, are looking to tour again and connect with their fansâ\\x80\\x94and obviously, touring contributes a big part of their income. Meanwhile, the demand from fans, who are looking to experience live events again, is just as strong, in some cases surpassing the demand we saw in 2019, pre-pandemic.  Eric Sheridan: We also heard from travel and mobility companies that people are getting out and about. As more people get vaccinated, theyâ\\x80\\x99re going back to school and back to work, although the travel picture has been a bit more volatile. This was an industry already facing slower growth prior to COVID-19, so we think companies' pandemic shifts toward local offerings and marketing targeted at deepening customer engagement are likely to stick, and we heard that echoed by presenters at our conference.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 30 September 2021     Bundle up this winter. Rising power and natural gas prices are pushing up bills for households across Europe and the U.S. At the Goldman Sachs Asset Management Forum, Kaelyn Lucas and Joanna Saw from the corporate credit team explain the drivers that are moving prices up and the outlook for corporates and consumers.   Whatâ\\x80\\x99s driving power and natural gas prices to record highs across Europe?  Joanna Saw: Soaring natural gas prices are feeding into power prices, so as gas prices have jumped by 2.5 times year-to-date, weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen power prices roughly double across Europe over that period. Itâ\\x80\\x99s really due to a perfect storm of events: A long winter drove demand during key periods when gas supplies are normally refilled and stored for the winter; cargoes of liquefied natural gas have been redirected from Europe to Asia; and Russia, a key exporter of gas, has slowed exports to Germany and the rest of Europe. All of these factors are resulting in higher power prices and, in fact, generating stronger demand for coal which is also seeing higher prices due to carbon pricing. The U.K. is being particularly squeezed given that the country is a net importer of power from France and Ireland, which have both been tightening exports.  What are the implications in this case for investors?  Joanna Saw: Invariably there will be winners and losers from these record commodity prices. We think the net winners will be investors who are long energy prices, such as large energy and power generation companies, while the net losers and those who will be most exposed are the buyers and suppliers. Households can also expect to pay higher utility bills given that 30% of the costs are tied to gas and power prices. U.K. utility bills, for example, are set to increase by 12% for the winter period due to price increases over summer 2021. And, with current forward prices, bills are expected to jump 25% further for the summer of 2022, which will hurt householdsâ\\x80\\x99 disposable income and boost inflation expectations for next year. The utilities in the U.K. are particularly hampered by a consumer energy price cap that was introduced in 2019 by the regulator Ofgem, which limited utilitiesâ\\x80\\x99 ability to pass on rising wholesale prices to customers (the price cap is reviewed by Ofgem every six months). As a result, many utilities are now struggling to absorb the higher costs; in some cases, the smaller utilities are shutting down.  And what does the situation look like in the U.S.?  Kaelyn Lucas: In the U.S., natural gas prices are approaching levels that we havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen since 2014, with a 30% run-up in U.S. Henry Hub natural gas prices. In fact, this is the first time gas prices have broken above the $5 per million BTU threshold since then. Overall, we can also expect to see higher winter heating bills for customers and higher costs for utilities. Similar to what Joanna notes, this is really a perfect storm of events in the U.S., where an unprecedented heat wave reduced the availability of gas to store for the winter months. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve also seen relatively flat gas production and record exports.  How will the electric and gas utilities manage the higher costs?  Kaelyn Lucas: The impact on gas utilities should be relatively neutral, as costs are likely to be shouldered by their customers. In fact, we havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen much bond price reaction because the expectation is that utilities will pass on the higher prices to consumers via regulatory mechanisms. Transmission and distribution utilitiesâ\\x80\\x94which have less coal and gas exposureâ\\x80\\x94will tend to fare better than natural gas utilities, which cannot switch fuels to more economic inputs such as coal and wind. But to the extent this situation persists, it could make investments in decarbonization and other capex more challenging for the vertically integrated electric utilities, while increasing the utilization of coalâ\\x80\\x94and carbon emissions across the industryâ\\x80\\x94in the near term.  The main impact, of course, will be customer affordability: The gas utilities have benefited from a decades-long tailwind of a declining cost environment, resulting in lower customer bills. Across the U.S., the average heating bill is around $60 a month and 40% of that can be attributed largely to purchased gas costs. So a 50% increase in the cost of gas would equate to a 20% bill increase. Over the long term, if higher prices persist and become the new equilibrium, this could potentially force U.S. households to allocate more of their income to paying gas bills while limiting utilities' ability to raise rates absent regulatory intervention.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 23 September 2021    How are healthcare systems coping with the delta variant? Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Veronika Dubajova shares key takeaways from her conversations with 30 global healthcare and medical technology CEOs and CFOs who virtually attended the firmâ\\x80\\x99s 18th Annual Medtech Conference last week.  How are healthcare management teams describing their current operating environments?  Veronika Dubajova: Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of variability around the globe, depending on the progress of the pandemic. Overall, the picture is improving in Europe: Hospital occupancy rates due to COVID are at low enough levels that they're enabling healthcare systems to operate fairly well at the moment. The healthcare system in the U.S., however, has been seeing sharply higher hospitalization rates due to the delta variant. But that pressure is regionalized, with higher hospitalization rates in the Southâ\\x80\\x94where vaccination rates are relatively lowâ\\x80\\x94and lower hospitalization rates in the North, where vaccination rates are higher. Outside of the U.S., weâ\\x80\\x99re closely watching China, Japan and Australia. With China in particular, the concern is not due to rising COVID-19 cases, but rather due to the government typically focusing on containment through more extreme measures at the first sign of an outbreak. In Japan and Australia, elective procedures at hospitals have been relatively soft, although they are starting to firm up.  The U.S. recently broke the 100,000 COVID-19 hospitalization threshold. Do you have any more insight into where U.S. hospitalization rates are headed?  Veronika Dubajova: I mentioned we are seeing wide disparities in hospitalization rates in the U.S. depending on the region weâ\\x80\\x99re looking at. For instance, at peak, almost 20% of all of the 100,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were in Florida, reflecting the lower vaccination rate of that state. The good news is that we seem to have passed the peak, with the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 now at about 82,000, versus 100,000 in early September; this development appears pretty consistent with some of the modeling we have seen around the likely progress of the delta wave. Most of the medtech management teams at our conference believe the winter will be very manageable, but there are still a lot of unknowns, such as new variants and whether hospital operators can cope with the flu season at the same time.  There is also a backlog of delayed care and elective procedures that healthcare systems are trying to work their way through. In 2020, the industry lost about 15% to 20% of elective procedures and of course, that medical need hasnâ\\x80\\x99t disappeared. As a result, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing increased investments into healthcare in select markets in the U.K. and also more broadly in Europe.  Where are vaccination rates headed and what should we watch next?  Veronika Dubajova: Overall, itâ\\x80\\x99s a fairly successful story in Europe, where vaccination rates are exceeding 70% of the population in most of developed Europe and the U.K. In fact, there are a handful of countries in Europe, including Portugal and Spain, where vaccination rates now exceed 80%. One of the main economies that remains a laggard in spite of vaccines being widely available is the U.S., although there's been decent progress recently due to the spread of the delta variant. Only 63% of the overall population in the U.S. has received at least one dose of the vaccine and only 53% has completed the vaccination course. As the last few months illustrate, the key thing to watch going forwardâ\\x80\\x94especially as we head into the winter season and if we see any new variantsâ\\x80\\x94will be vaccine coverage, not just nationally but also regionally, where regions with lower vaccine coverage will tend to see bigger outbreaks, all else being equal.  Much of the current focus is on whether booster shots will be needed. What have you learned from people in the health sector?  Veronika Dubajova: This has been a widely debated issue, and there are several important factors at play. On the one hand, we know the boosters work when it comes to increasing the antibody response. The key question, however, is whether or not boosters are actually needed, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of disagreement on this in the scientific community. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen countries like Israel start a booster campaign, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s still a lot of discussion around additional shots in the U.K. and the U.S. The question that will inform this decision is whether the decline in protection against COVID-19 that we have observed in recent months is truly a function of waning efficacy or rather related to something else, like new variants. At this point in time, the consensus seems to be that the vaccines' supposedly declining protection likely has more to do with delta than waning efficacy, but we need more time and data to further assess this hypothesis.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 16 September 2021    As dealmaking surges across the globe, mergers and acquisitions activity in Australia is hitting new highs. We spoke with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Marissa Freund, head of the mergers and acquisitions business in Australia and New Zealand (A/NZ), about what's fueling the M&A boom and her outlook going forward.  What kind of M&A activity have you been seeing in Australia and New Zealand?  Marissa Freund: None of us can remember a market where there has been so much volume at such a material scale. So far this year, thereâ\\x80\\x99s been nearly US$200 billion of announced M&A transactionsâ\\x80\\x94more than three times the five-year averageâ\\x80\\x94making it the most active year on record, and we still have another quarter to go. In just the last three months, we've seen the largest deals in Australian M&A history across a variety of sectors: In natural resources, with BHPâ\\x80\\x99s US$86 billion proposed unification of its dual-listed company structure and US$14 billion sale of its petroleum business to Woodside; in fintech, with Afterpayâ\\x80\\x99s US$29 billion sale to Square; and in infrastructure with a US$23 billion proposed acquisition of Sydney Airport by a consortium of infrastructure and super funds. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s more, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing a shift toward large-cap deals (given that roughly 80% of transactions reflect an enterprise value of more than US$1 billion) and a rise in competitive M&A bids.  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s driving this activity?  Marissa Freund: Itâ\\x80\\x99s really a confluence of factors thatâ\\x80\\x99s creating an attractive environment for M&A. Strong equity valuations are spurring both buyers and sellers to capitalize on M&A opportunities, and the Australian economy is healthy thanks to accommodative policy settings. There was also potentially some pent-up demand after the M&A hiatus we saw during the first wave of COVID-19 in 2020. Against that backdrop, CEO and boardroom confidence is high, spurring corporates to reposition their businesses and portfolio mix to succeed in a post-COVID operating environment. After taking a cautious approach in 2020, buyers are drawing on dry powder to take advantage of the low-cost funding environment.  Many of these factors are similar to what we are seeing globally, but what differentiates the Australian environment, given the Australian compulsory superannuation regime, is that we are also witnessing the rising involvement of large pension funds. Particularly in infrastructure, super fund investors are increasingly looking at creative ways to put capital to work at scale both within and outside traditional categories. This class of investor is also behind the uptick in consortia involvement, particularly on public-to-private transactions, as we have seen with the Sydney airport takeover bid by a consortium. We expect these super fund investors to continue to be active in M&A.  What are you seeing in terms of cross-border activity?  Marissa Freund: Around 40% of A/NZ M&A activity this year has been cross-border. Inbound activity has been driven by both strategic and financial sponsor buyers. Meanwhile, there have also been large-scale outbound transactions by Australian corporates into new international markets, particularly in the tech space. And there is more opportunity to come. The amount of activity has highlighted the quality and attractiveness of Australian assets, and we are still regarded as a friendly place to do business, given the relatively stable regulatory environment, rule of law and strong economy, which weathered the global financial crisis and now the COVID pandemic really well.  Do you expect this pace of M&A continue?  Marissa Freund: In short, yes. We are seeing the tailwinds heading into 2022: Corporate balance sheets have never been stronger; financial buyers are keen to put their stores of capital to work; and interest rates are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the perfect recipe for significant M&A activity in the next 12 months across all sectors.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 9 September 2021    The pandemic is accelerating the pace of innovation and investments across the global healthcare landscape, explain Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Jenny Chang, a portfolio manager in Asset Managementâ\\x80\\x99s Fundamental Equity business, and Jim Sinclair of the Investment Banking Division. Both shared their views at a recent Healthcare Investor Forum event.  Jim, you work with companies across the healthcare services and technology sectors. How would you describe the flow of private capital into the space?  Jim Sinclair: The amount of private capital that is being invested in companies that support both healthcare innovation and technology is growing exponentially. In 2012, for example, investors allocated about $1 billion of private capital into this space. That number grew to around $13 billion for the first half of 2021, according to our analysis. While valuations are higher and there is, to a certain extent, an exuberance in the market, there is more permanency to the capital that is flowing into growth equity investments that is likely to continue throughout different market cycles.  And how is that capital affecting innovation?  Jenny Chang: Itâ\\x80\\x99s turbocharging technological innovation. Drugs are being developed more quickly and timelines are getting shorter. And the pace of that innovation is unlikely to slow. Advancements in medical devices and minimally invasive procedures like robotics are accelerating, and advances in genomics and gene editing have created enormous opportunities to find cures for the worldâ\\x80\\x99s diseases.  So what types of innovations are you most excited about?  Jenny Chang: Genomics and next-generation medicines are key areas of interest for us as investors, as are sectors where technology and healthcare intersect, such as minimally invasive technology and digital healthcare more broadly. Take genomics, for example: Weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a dramatic reduction in the costs of sequencing a human genome, from billions of dollars 20 years ago to several hundred dollars today. The technology is not only ready for broad usage but itâ\\x80\\x99s creating data and insights that are leading to next-generation medicines such as targeted oncology treatment. To put this in perspective, weâ\\x80\\x99ve sequenced only about 0.2% of the human genome and weâ\\x80\\x99ve found cures for only about 5% of an estimated 5,000 rare diseases, according to industry estimates. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a long runway of growth as we continue to improve our understanding of the connection between genetic mutations and diseases, so the opportunity here is enormous.  Jim, from your perspective, how is technology reshaping the companies you work with?  Jim Sinclair: Technology is actually reorganizing the way companies have traditionally made money in the sector. In the healthcare insurance sector, for example, next-generation insurance companies are accessing the public markets through IPOs in order to use technology to automate processes, drive engagement and create a more user-friendly experience for members and providers.  Looking into the near term, what are some emerging trends that youâ\\x80\\x99re watching?  Jim Sinclair: Two trends to watch are increased demand for mental healthcare and treating diabetes; both are conditions that appear to have proliferated during the pandemic-induced lockdowns. Delivery of long-term healthcare is evolving, as well; the pandemic has accelerated home care models, including hospital-at-home models and specialty-at-home models. Weâ\\x80\\x99re spending a lot of time with clients on acute care and discussing how to use technology to serve patients at home, across the spectrum of disease. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of capital out there to support the growth companies that focus on these areas of care.'},\n",

We sat down with Alexander Mejia, who leads the private equity sponsor secondary market advisory within the Investment Banking Division to discuss the growing popularity of these vehicles.   Alexander, what are continuation funds and how do they work?  Alexander Mejia: Traditional private equity funds are typically set up with fixed 10-year terms; the sponsorsâ\\x80\\x99 goal is to acquire businesses, create value and ultimately sell the businesses within that period. But what weâ\\x80\\x99re increasingly seeing is that more sponsors want to hold on to their investments for longer. In some cases, itâ\\x80\\x99s because the investment is performing wellâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s a â\\x80\\x9ctrophy assetâ\\x80\\x9d within their portfolio and they donâ\\x80\\x99t want to part ways with it. Alternatively, they want to give the business more time and money to develop, which the business may not have had, given the existing fundâ\\x80\\x99s term and capital constraints. At the same time, limited partners (LPs) are increasingly focused on liquidity, especially with sponsorsâ\\x80\\x99 longer-dated assets, so thereâ\\x80\\x99s a duration mismatch between the sponsors who arenâ\\x80\\x99t ready to sell those assets and the limited partners who want to monetize their investments. Continuation funds are a transaction structure that works to achieve two objectives: First, they allow private equity sponsors to provide their LPs a liquidity optionâ\\x80\\x94they can elect to cash out or roll into the new vehicle. Second, the funds extend the duration of their holdings and raise new capital to accelerate M&A or other growth initiatives at the underlying companies. At the end of the day, these transactions should provide a win-win outcome to all parties involved.   Tell us more about why some sponsors want to hold on to their investments for longer.  Alexander Mejia: In many cases, sponsors see additional room for their investments in certain companies to grow. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve spent years developing strong relationships with management teams and building high-quality businesses that they often sell prematurely to satisfy existing fund dynamics. Rather than sell outright, they would prefer to continue owning and growing the business. Sponsors further benefit from their ability to retain assets under management through these transactions. Lastly, given the increased competitiveness of the sponsor market, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing GPs invest alongside other investors in the continuation funds into their â\\x80\\x9ctrophy assets,â\\x80\\x9d thereby finding unique ways to deploy new capital and increase their overall exposure to these assets.   How did the pandemic affect sponsorsâ\\x80\\x99 interest in continuation funds?  Alexander Mejia: The pandemic has been a big driver of volume, because many of the underlying portfolio companies fell behind in their growth plans and needed more time and capital to get back on track. So sponsors are using continuation funds as a way to ensure they can grow the companies to their full potential. In fact, total transaction volume in continuation funds led by general partners is expected to more than double in 2021 to about $50 billion, up from about $23 billion in 2019. And I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be surprised to see that jump another 50% next year. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s just tremendous momentum behind the supply of these transactions.  Letâ\\x80\\x99s talk about the capital thatâ\\x80\\x99s going into these vehicles. What does the landscape look like?  Alexander Mejia: Thereâ\\x80\\x99s been an explosion of new capital supply into this market driven by both existing secondary market investors raising new capital focused solely on continuation vehicles, as well as new entrants such as family offices and hedge funds who find the risk-adjusted returns of these vehicles particularly attractive. More recently, there has been a wave of activity by some of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s biggest asset managers who are now building or buying dedicated secondary platforms with the aim of leveraging existing distribution channels to raise substantial capital focused on the secondary markets. As this market continues to evolveâ\\x80\\x94and I believe that we are still in the early inningsâ\\x80\\x94continuation funds could replace a significant portion of sponsor-to-sponsor M&A. As a result, many larger firms are raising capital to find unique ways to access these assets through the secondary market.    And what about the LPsâ\\x80\\x94are they being treated fairly if the sponsors decide to hold onto the assets longer?  Alexander Mejia: LPs are the lifeblood of any sponsorâ\\x80\\x99s franchise so extra consideration is spent ensuring these transactions are designed for and structured with their interests in mind. These transactions provide LPs with optionalityâ\\x80\\x94they are presented with the option to liquidate their positions or roll their interest into the new vehicle. In every situation, the sponsor hires an investment bank, such as Goldman Sachs, to run a process and get a fair value for the LPs in that transaction. If there is new dry powder that is invested as part of the continuation fund, existing LPs are also offered the right to participate on a pro rata basis so their holdings arenâ\\x80\\x99t diluted. There is also full symmetry of information in the process so that LPs have everything they need to make an informed election. These are complex transactions with multiple constituentsâ\\x80\\x94they require specialization to manage, which is why we have built a dedicated team to focused on this effort. If managed properly, then LPs are treated fairly.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 13 August 2021     Attempts to move the global economy toward net zero carbon emissions over the next decade will continue to raise the prices of commoditiesâ\\x80\\x94particularly those needed to develop low-carbon technologies. Aluminium is no exception, yet it poses a unique paradox: It is a necessary element of technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels, but its production generates a lot of carbonâ\\x80\\x942% of all global emissions. We sat down with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Nick Snowdon to hear his view of why aluminium prices are going to keep rising over the next five years.  Nick, can you walk us through your argument that aluminiumâ\\x80\\x99s status as both a cause of climate change and a part of the solution will result in higher prices?  Nick Snowdon: Weâ\\x80\\x99ll need to procure enough aluminium to continue developing technologies that decarbonize our economies while keeping the toll on the climate to a minimum. We think this will result in significant cost inflation for the metal. Higher aluminium prices will be required to incentivize smelters to invest in cleaner methods of production against the backdrop of rising demand and slowing supply growth. In fact, green demand for the metal is rising just as supply growth is set for a sharp decline in the first half of this decade. Investment in additional aluminium capacity outside of China has been largely curtailed amid stricter climate-related policies.  Where is aluminium used in clean tech?  Nick Snowdon: A large chunk of the demand comes from the electric vehicles industry. We predict EV-related demand to grow at a rate of 20% per year for the remainder of the decade. An EV contains on average 250 kilograms of aluminium, 70 kilograms more than a vehicle with an internal combustion engine. The lightweight, recyclable metal is used in a number of components, ranging from EV-specific parts like battery casings and the electric motor housings to more traditional car parts like wheels and brakes. Aluminium is also used in the majority of components making up solar panels, as well as in the towers of wind turbines.  What role will policymakers play in facilitating this demand?  Nick Snowdon: Over the past six months, economies making up almost 70% of global GDP have outlined policies to strengthen their commitment to curbing climate change, from Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s 2060 net zero pledge to Europeâ\\x80\\x99s carbon border tax proposal. The momentum is there. Policymakers must make it more cost-effective for producers to switch to production methods that are more environmentally friendly. One strategy, currently underway in China, is to place caps on coal-powered production and thus create a scarcity to be filled by green producers. Another is to force producers to pay the cost of carbon emissions through policies like a carbon tax, ultimately making pollutive production uncompetitive. The latter is underway in Europe and we think will be the dominant strategy going forward.  What are your projections for aluminium prices over the next few years?  Nick Snowdon: We recently upgraded our forecasts and now project aluminium to average $2,450/ton in 2021, $2,900/ton in 2022 and $3,250/ton in 2023 before levelling off at $3,500/ton in 2025. We believe the metal is in the early stages of a multiyear bull market.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 05 August 2021    In June, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government made history when it sold the first municipal social bond ever issued in Japanâ\\x80\\x94and saw a record-high participation rate from international investors. We spoke with Satoru Kawahito and Hiroaki Kasai from Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 public sector and infrastructure team in the Investment Banking Division to discuss the transaction and what it means for the future of public sector funding space in Japan.  This was a first-of-its-kind issuance in Japan. Can you give us some of the background to the transaction?  Satoru Kawahito: There has been a surge in social bond issuance over the past year or so, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to highlight inequalities that require new solutions and the financing to implement them. In March, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) updated its long-term vision, recognizing the profound impact the pandemic has had on the city. Centered on the two pillars of structural reform and sustainable recovery, the plan consists of 21 strategies designed to create a safe, attractive and enjoyable city where citizens have an equal chance to fulfill their potential.  Social bonds, where proceeds are earmarked specifically for projects with a measurable social benefit, were a natural choice to help fund these plans. TMGâ\\x80\\x99s debut 30 billion yen five-year bond, which priced in June, will help fund schools for children with special needs, programs to support mothers returning to the workforce and a low-cost loan facility for small- and medium-sized enterprises impacted by the pandemic, among other projects.  What drove such strong demand?  Satoru Kawahito: Institutional interest in ESG investing has grown exponentially over the last few years. While environmental issues have been at the vanguard of socially responsible investing, the experience of the pandemic and its human toll has renewed focus on the social element of ESG and, in turn, fueled global investor appetite for social bonds.  Hiroaki Kasai: Last fall, we helped TMG tap into this demand by issuing a 60 billion yen five-year â\\x80\\x9cCOVID-19 response bondâ\\x80\\x9d to fund rescue financing for cash-strapped local businesses. Given the urgent need, TMG prioritized time-to-market and opted out of seeking an independent second opinion for the issue. Instead, we helped TMG explain its fundraising plans directly to investors through a series of online sessions. While the bond attracted significant demand and priced tightly, certain investors couldnâ\\x80\\x99t participate in the offering since their mandates required accreditation for ESG investments. Since then, TMG has drawn up a social bond framework based on the International Capital Market Associationâ\\x80\\x99s (ICMA) Social Bond Principles. We helped TMG structure its debut social bond based on this framework and included a second opinion from an established local ratings agency, which made the offering accessible to a wider ESG investor community. As a result, the bond priced at the tightest level since March 2020 for a Japanese local government bond, with a yield of just 0.005%, or 75% lower than the earlier COVID-19 response bond.  The vast majority of Japanese local government yen debt is held domestically, yet this offering attracted one of the highest-ever participation rates from international investors for a Japanese municipal bond. Why was that?  Satoru Kawahito: Whether based in Japan or overseas, investorsâ\\x80\\x99 motivations are essentially the same: a commitment to ESG and a desire to contribute to pandemic relief. However, when you consider that the deal saw participation even from first-time investors in yen-denominated debt, we think a few other factors were also in play.  Hiroaki Kasai: First, the offering size, at 30 billion yen, made it easier for larger international ESG-focused investors to take part. To date, Japanese municipal ESG issues, particularly green bonds, have often been around 5 to 10 billion yen in size, making it difficult for larger investors to secure their minimum purchase size. Secondly, the rarity value and Tokyoâ\\x80\\x99s brand were also important. While social bond issuance from Japan has risen from 35 billion yen in 2016 to 915 billion yen in 2020, issuance levels are still well behind the U.S. and Europe. As investors around the world hunt for yield, there is always an added degree of interest in debut issuesâ\\x80\\x93all the more so if they come from a high-quality issuer and with a credible ESG label. With an economy bigger than Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s and annual bond issuance of around US$ 8 billion, Tokyo is a well-established issuer in the global capital markets with an excellent credit history. International investors who may have been interested in last yearâ\\x80\\x99s COVID-19 Response bond, but chose to stay on the sidelines then, were now able to take part in a fully accredited issue. Finally, Japanâ\\x80\\x99s local-government bond market is second only to the U.S. in scale, with $57 billion of issuance in fiscal year 2018. Globally, Japanese local government non-yen debt has a loyal following in the international investor community, who are attracted by the countryâ\\x80\\x99s strong credit record, excess spreads over Japanese government bonds and robust investor protection regime. We were able to help TMG tap into this existing investor base too.  Will this debut issue prompt other local governments in Japan to consider social bonds?  Satoru Kawahito: While ESG bond issuance has been steadily growing in Japan, there have been some hurdles for would-be local government issuers. For example, some local governments have been skeptical about the need to issue dedicated social bonds, since so much of their activities can be classified as socially oriented. Others have struggled to identify projects large enough to warrant a bond, particularly due to legal constraints on how bond financing can be used. Some of this may reflect a tendency for what is known as â\\x80\\x9cgreen-blushingâ\\x80\\x9d in the green bond marketâ\\x80\\x94essentially the opposite of green washingâ\\x80\\x94which refers to issuers who underplay the significance of their environmental initiatives. The same may be true of local governments, who may be undervaluing the importance of the social support programs they run. This would be especially unfortunate, since Japanâ\\x80\\x99s prefectures, cities and towns actually provide a greater proportion of social services than the national government.  Hiroaki Kasai: As the capital city, TMG has been a pioneer in the Japan municipal bond markets and we are hopeful that its debut social bond will provide a benchmark for other municipalities. The strong demand for the offering has made clear the potential benefits of pursuing third-party accreditation, in terms of investor base diversification and lower funding costs. There is now a template for other local governments when considering which of their projects may be eligible. And as Tokyo plans to sell another 30 billion yen of social bonds this year, we should see sustained investor interest in this new provenance of social debt. At the same time, as a growing number of municipalities are setting ESG and or SDGs related multi-year goals for their communities, they may begin exploring the possibility of sustainability linked-bonds, a new ICMA format which requires issuers to set sustainability objectives but do not limit the use of funds to individual projects.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 30 July 2021    What's driving the surge in M&A activity in the software industry? We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Ryan Nolan and Nick Pomponi, global co-heads of the Investment Banking Divisionâ\\x80\\x99s software business, to get the inside scoop.  Weâ\\x80\\x99ve heard about how the pandemic and remote work dramatically accelerated digital transformations across industries, creating opportunities for software companies. How is the software industry faring now that companies are going back into the office and the economy is reopening?  Ryan Nolan: We saw how software was one of the most critical areas of focus and investment during the pandemic. Remote work and the need for the digital-first office challenged nearly every aspect of an organizationâ\\x80\\x99s software stack to evolve and scale nearly overnight, from security to collaboration and communication applications to resiliency and infrastructure platforms. Itâ\\x80\\x99s still early but the strong financial results in the first half of the year combined with a solid recovery of valuations in growth software would suggest that the near-term outlook for software remains very bright. Anecdotal signals would suggest that the return to the office and the reopening of the economy have only highlighted the benefits and productivity gains businesses have enjoyed by accelerating digital transformation. Businesses across all industries now have to build infrastructure to support an employee base that likely expects greater flexibility in how and where they work, and a customer base that expects nearly every aspect of their interactions with a vendor to be digital-first. From our perspective, technology and software are at the heart of facilitating that new paradigm, and the flywheel only continues to accelerate.  Software M&A activity has been elevated for several years but weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a sharp uptick in the last 12 to 24 months. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s driving that activity?  Nick Pomponi: Several factors are converging to create a dynamic software M&A market. For one, major companies across all industriesâ\\x80\\x94not just technologyâ\\x80\\x94are realizing they need to essentially become software companies themselves in one form or another to keep up. Case in point is Rockwell Automationâ\\x80\\x99s recent acquisition of Plex Systems, a software-as-a-service smart manufacturing company, which will transform Rockwellâ\\x80\\x99s manufacturing operations. Private equity firms, which are sitting on large reserves of dry powder, are increasingly deploying that capital in the tech and software markets, leading to some large acquisitions, such as Thoma Bravoâ\\x80\\x99s $12.3 billion acquisition of the cybersecurity and compliance company Proofpoint. And finally, among large corporationsâ\\x80\\x94known as strategic buyersâ\\x80\\x94weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing the next generation of large software companies (think: Salesforce, Zoom, Twilio and ServiceNow among others) compete with the mega-cap tech players (like Google, Amazon and Microsoft) to provide companiesâ\\x80\\x99 entire software suite, resulting in landscape-shifting transactions, such as Zoomâ\\x80\\x99s acquisition of Five9.  Can you describe the IPO market for software companies?  Ryan Nolan: The short answer is â\\x80\\x9cvolatile but durable.â\\x80\\x9d Volatility creeped into the software IPO market early spring when valuations in growth software fell from their 2020 record highs, ending a software IPO market where a company could do no wrong. Valuations have since recovered from the spring lows, but what I find more remarkable is the quality of software companies we saw come to market despite the volatility and the strong investor receptivity.  We saw software companies come to market that change the way we work, such as Monday.com, or reinvent how we manage data, such as Confluent. Given the quality of the companies we see in our IPO pipeline, combined with software-as-a-service business models that deliver significant visibility in financial models, we expect the new issuance market for software to remain robust and active even in the relative turmoil of volatile markets.  So where are we headed? What is the next big thing in software?  Nick Pomponi: We expect to continue to see AI-enabled software applications that will change the way we work, whether it is through programs that automate worker processes or transform companiesâ\\x80\\x99 legacy platforms. The exciting part is that we believe weâ\\x80\\x99re still in the early innings of this data, and AI and automation revolution.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 09 July 2021    As one of the longest-tenured CEOs on Wall Street, Jefferies Financial Group CEO Rich Handler has seen his share of market cycles, crises and technological changes. In a recent conversation with Katie Koch, co-head of Goldman Sachs Asset Managementâ\\x80\\x99s Fundamental Equity business, Handler shared his thoughts on the economy, capital markets activity and innovation across sectors.   Katie Koch: Rich, we last spoke more than a year ago when we were in the depths of the pandemic. Today, with economies in various stages of reopening, can you share your macro outlook on the strength of the recovery?  Rich Handler: The economic recovery is closely tied to the actual vaccine rollout. But given that it is likely we will need booster shots to fight against variants, the road to full recovery is going to be longer than most people expect. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not like a light switchâ\\x80\\x94it will be more of a dimmer switch slowly being turned on. So while we are bullish on the recovery overall, thereâ\\x80\\x99s also a pacing component of how long it will take to eventually get to herd immunity and how we will deal with ongoing variants. Unfortunately, we will be dealing with COVID for years and weâ\\x80\\x99re trying to figure out how to prepare our people for that perspective.  Katie Koch: Youâ\\x80\\x99ve expressed concern that the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s fiscal stimulus could worsen income inequality in the U.S. In fact, we did see rapid wealth creation in the capital markets over the last year which has left part of American society behind. But weâ\\x80\\x99ve also effectively seen an increase in minimum wages through this stimulus, which is resulting in higher wages. From our perspective, we believe we could be on the precipice of a redistribution cycle from capital to labor that could result in inflationary pressures. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s your view on income inequality, and how do you think the Federal Reserve will take that into account in its policymaking?  Rich Handler: I think the worldâ\\x80\\x99s in a dangerous place right now. Income inequality has worsened for a variety of reasons. That will have implications on the political landscape in terms of how policymakers try to redistribute wealth. I think the Fed is going to try to keep unemployment as low as possible and not worry as much about inflation as higher prices start to seep into the system. The Fed will want to be as accommodative as possible to keep our society functioning, but while weâ\\x80\\x99ve tried to address systemic issues, weâ\\x80\\x99ve left a lot of people out of the recovery and thatâ\\x80\\x99s going to be one of the biggest issues weâ\\x80\\x99re going to have to deal with going forward.  Katie Koch: Letâ\\x80\\x99s talk about the capital markets. The industry has just posted one of its strongest quarters of M&A activity, with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, playing a key role. What do you think about the sustainability of M&A and SPACs?  Rich Handler: So I think SPACs are here to stay, but they arenâ\\x80\\x99t a panacea that can solve all of companiesâ\\x80\\x99 problems. At the same time, SPACs are also not something to be fearedâ\\x80\\x94they're just like any other financial structure to take a company public. SPACs have become popular because the traditional IPO process is still cumbersome, complicated and can take nine months to a year to complete, during which a company might end up missing the window to go public. SPACs, on the other hand, are quiet negotiations and a much quicker way to go public. But there can be issues with SPACs that are looking for acquisitions given that weâ\\x80\\x99re increasingly seeing retail investors bid up the stocks of potential targets.  Katie Koch: Jefferies is deeply involved in the healthcare markets where thereâ\\x80\\x99s been a tremendous amount of innovation. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s your current outlook on innovation in this space?  Rich Handler: The technological change that weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen has been years and decades in the making. Developing the COVID vaccine in the last year was a truly remarkable achievement. But weâ\\x80\\x99re going to have to build upon that going forward. Bioterrorism is a real issue, and the world has seen how fragile it really is. So weâ\\x80\\x99re going to see the U.S. start to onshore healthcare capabilities that we had previously outsourced from a cost perspective in order to better protect ourselves. The innovation has been remarkable in everything from cancer treatments to the integration of big data into healthcare technologies. Iâ\\x80\\x99m very optimistic about all of that, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s still so much to do. But thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of capital going into the space now, which is a great thing.  Katie Koch: So as Wall Streetâ\\x80\\x99s longest-tenured CEO, what advice would you have for people who are just starting out in their careers? What do you wish someone had told you when you were starting out on your own journey?  Rich Handler: The most important thing in your career is developing relationships. If you can actually get people to trust you and if you can have empathy for other people, I think you will have a remarkably successful career, and you will have a much more fun life. And itâ\\x80\\x99s a long race.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 02 July 2021    Spurred by the uncertainty over the pandemic, corporations have amassed a record amount of cash. We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Hari Moorthy, global head of transaction banking, to discuss the evolving landscape for cash management.  Goldman Sachs recently launched its corporate transaction banking service in the U.K., following its launch in the U.S. last year. Hari, can you start by explaining what corporate transaction banking is?  Hari Moorthy: Transaction banking at Goldman Sachs is a service that we provide to corporates to manage their cash, manage business-to-business payments, accept receivables, and make payments across 125+ countries. Corporations tend to have hundreds, sometimes thousands, of business accounts across multiple entities and geographies. And depending on the companyâ\\x80\\x99s size, it needs to process millions of transactions through those accounts each day. Our vision is to provide our clients with a globalized, modern cash management platform that is secure, easy to use, and nimble to support them as they run and grow their businesses.  And why did you decide to launch in the U.K.?  Hari Moorthy: The U.K. is an attractive market for corporate cash management because of the number of companies based there with international payment needs. The transaction banking wallet in the U.K., for example, is estimated to be between $20 billion and $30 billion, according to data from McKinsey, while London is a global FX hub due to its history as a global financial center, its use of the English language, and convenient time zone. Many multinational corporations have large international treasury functions in London and the U.K., including cash pooling, intercompany borrowing and lending, FX management and payable and receivable management, and we believe that by expanding to the U.K. we can help these companies manage, optimize and digitize their complex treasury operations.  So how is transaction banking evolving and why is Goldman Sachs expanding into this business?  Hari Moorthy: The corporate cash management industry is ripe for disruption given that treasury functions are still largely manual and dependent on paper trails. In fact, it can take weeks for companies to get accounts up and running. That said, digitization has picked up materially over the past year as businesses have had to adapt to contactless payments. Additionally, transaction banking can be viewed as a stabilizing anchor for banks, with revenue volatility generally lower than capital markets products.  What does the competitive landscape look like?  Hari Moorthy: Large commercial banks have developed scale and â\\x80\\x9cstickinessâ\\x80\\x9d in this industry, but they tend to have legacy technology platforms that make innovation difficult. Fintech companies are also competing, but theyâ\\x80\\x99re solving very specific payment challenges.

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 24 June 2021    Management teams from more than 220 healthcare companies participated in Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 42nd annual Global Healthcare conference in June to share their thoughts on the recovery, vaccine rollouts and the evolution in the delivery of healthcare services. We sat down with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Asad Haider, a business unit leader in healthcare, and Veronika Dubajova, head of Medical Technology Research in Europe, who shared key takeaways from the event.  As global economies begin to lift lockdown restrictions, where is the healthcare industry on the path to recovery?  Asad Haider: The conversations we had with management teams at the conference paint a picture of uneven recovery. Companies in certain areas of biotech, for example, struck a fairly conservative tone on the near-term outlook, as their volumes are still trailing pre-COVID levels. But in areas like medical technology and dental, the tone was much more upbeat in telling a story of normalization, albeit with some caveats. In these areas, we're hearing about patients who may be postponing elective surgeries to take vacations and travel first, following vaccinations.  Veronika Dubajova: In the medtech sector, the overall volumes of medical and elective procedures appear to be running at 95% to 100% of pre-COVID levels. The U.S. is almost back to normal, while Europe is lagging a bit given the slower pace of vaccinations. China, meanwhile, is already above pre-COVID levels. So we are slowly but surely moving in the right direction. There is, of course, a bit of variability depending on the type of healthcare procedure. So individuals with heart problems, for example, are booking their procedures sooner than, say, someone with a hip issue. Looking ahead, we expect to see pent-up demand from people who had postponed medical procedures last year to drive growth in the second half of the year, though this â\\x80\\x9cpent-up demandâ\\x80\\x9d will likely not materialize at the same pace everywhere.  How do you think the delivery of healthcare may change post COVID-19?  Veronika Dubajova: We expect three key shifts in healthcare delivery as a result of the pandemic. The first is focused on decentralization. As more services are shifted to an outpatient setting, that should increase efficiencies, lower costs and reduce infection rates as patients reduce the amount of time they spend in hospitals. And as hospitals build additional satellite sites, we expect to see higher demand for operating theater equipment, imaging machines, MRIs and X-rays for these outpatient centers. The pandemic also accelerated the digitization of the healthcare sector. While some healthcare providers are starting slowly by building online portals for patients to book appointments or conduct telehealth visits, others are using predictive analytics or automating through AI to improve productivity. Finally, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing greater investments overall into healthcare. Governments across Europe are investing in healthcare infrastructure, and there is now a central European healthcare fund, the first of its kind in Europe. China, meanwhile, is building fever clinics to accommodate future COVID-19 outbreaks.  Asad Haider: Along those lines, we would describe the hospital capex cycle as strong. Leading equipment manufacturers say they expect a significant rebound compared with the 2020 trough, driven by a combination of improving hospital finances, constrained capacity and pent-up demand.  Finally, what are you seeing in terms of COVID-19 testing and vaccination progress?  Asad Haider: The good news is that as the vaccine rollout continues, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing a decline in COVID-19 testing, especially in countries with high vaccination rates such as the U.S. and Israel, where COVID testing has fallen about 60% to 80%. On the vaccine front, the need for third-dose boosters was underscored in some cases, as was the potential to move into the private market following the pandemic phase-driven government orders. Additionally, a couple of suppliers for the various inputs that go into vaccine manufacturing have told us that theyâ\\x80\\x99re already starting to see orders for 2023, which shows not only a willingness from vaccine manufacturers to be prepared but also signals that they believe itâ\\x80\\x99s going to take some time to get vaccinations everywhere. So that's something that we're watching pretty closely.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 17 June 2021    At Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 annual TechNet Conference, senior leaders from the firmâ\\x80\\x99s Investment Banking and Financing business in the Asia-Pacific region discussed what's driving the recent surge in capital markets activity. Philippa Vizzone moderated a conversation with Aaron Arth, Raghav Maliah and Jung Min on the outlook for corporate activity in the region. Below are excerpts from their conversation.  Raghav Maliah: The pace of digitization significantly accelerated during the pandemic. Things that we were expecting to happen a couple of years down the road are all happening now. In general, technology has helped the world cope and live life in a more normal way. And over time, it's also changing behaviors.  Jung Min: It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t that long ago that we were talking about why companies were staying private for longer and continuing to grow in size as private companies. Interestingly, it seems that with COVID and the acceleration in the digitization of fundamental technologies, weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a wave of private companies decide it was the right time to go public. We actually started to see this in the Asia-Pacific region first, starting last August, and itâ\\x80\\x99s been an incredibly busy period since then.  Philippa Vizzone: Aaron, as head of financing for the region, can you describe its state of financing at a time when weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a blistering pace of companies going public? What has the appetite been like for listings and follow-on offerings?  Aaron Arth: Weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing increased liquidity in the markets and thatâ\\x80\\x99s provided a strong base for companies to raise capital and fund the growth they need in the region. As a result, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing companies raise capital at a breakneck pace. For example, year-to-date issuance has already surpassed the full-year volumes for 11 of the last 15 years. While companies in the TMT sector have been particularly active, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing activity across sectors and platforms, as well as record volumes of issuance in the secondary market across primary or convertible securities.  Philippa Vizzone: Given this strong base of capital raising, what do you expect to see on the horizon for China in the next 12 months?  Raghav Maliah: Over the next few years, we expect to see 300 to 400 companies in Asia go public. And to be clear, these arenâ\\x80\\x99t startups, but developed, high-quality businesses with strong fundamentals that are expected to be profitable, having already benefited from available private capital. To be sure, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing a little bit of indigestion right now with markets in Asia falling more recently and rising concerns over inflation, but we remain optimistic.  Aaron Arth: While itâ\\x80\\x99s true that weâ\\x80\\x99re probably getting a bit of pushback from the market, given the record levels of issuance, if you take a step back and look at whatâ\\x80\\x99s actually going on, the type of companies coming to market are well established. This is a crucial and differentiating factor. During the tech bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s, startups were often just adding a â\\x80\\x9cdot-comâ\\x80\\x9d to their names and going public in a market that was euphoric. Today, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a strong set of corporates coming into the market with an enormous amount of capitalâ\\x80\\x94and importantly global capitalâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s available for the region. These are companies that should be going public. So we believe this is just the next stage of maturation in this region for companies, particularly those in and around tech.  Philippa Vizzone: Just to widen our perspectives, can you describe some of the opportunities in India and the Southeast Asia markets?  Jung Min: Weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen growing investor interest in those markets in recent years. While China is clearly the biggest geographic market in the region, Southeast Asia and Korea are garnering more attention as companies show that theyâ\\x80\\x99re able to scale beyond their borders. And we think weâ\\x80\\x99ll soon see multibillion-dollar companies in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. In India, we see a large pipeline of private companies that have been able to grow tremendously because of the availability of private capital thatâ\\x80\\x99s been growing in India over the last five to 10 years. And at some point, weâ\\x80\\x99re going to see those companies tap the public markets.  Philippa Vizzone: And what would be the catalyst for these companies to tap the public markets?  Aaron Arth: Weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen how the access to global, not just local, capital has spurred companies in China to go public, and we expect this global capital will be a key catalyst in these markets, as well. In particular, India has been an isolated market for some time with a lot of local capital driving the market. Today, thereâ\\x80\\x99s greater scale in the amount of capital thatâ\\x80\\x99s being raised. And that capital creates greater liquidity. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s always been an interest in these markets, but the question was: How do you invest in these markets with some safety and security with liquidity behind it? Now investors have a lot more comfort in entering these markets.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 10 June 2021    Earlier this year, the European Investment Bank (EIB) issued and settled its first-ever digital bond using Ethereum blockchain technology. We sat down with Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets, and Maud Le Moine, head of sovereign, supranational and agency origination in the Investment Banking Division, to discuss the transaction and its implications for capital markets and digital finance.  Goldman Sachs was one of three banks leading the transaction for EIBâ\\x80\\x99s first-ever digital bond on the blockchain. Can you provide some of the background on how the deal came together?  Maud Le Moine: Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a history of public sector clients, such as the EIB, the World Bank and other public sector issuers, being at the forefront of innovation in the capital markets. For the EIB, which has a long history of spearheading innovation (the bank issued the marketâ\\x80\\x99s first green bond, for example) and is one of the largest issuers in the European markets, debt issuance on the blockchain was a natural space for them to explore. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve worked with the EIB on a variety of initiatives, and they came to us, along with Societe Generale and Santander, about a year and a half ago with the goal of being the first to issue a fully digital bond. So we worked closely with the other banks on the design, technological setup and the legal framework to bring the transaction to life.  Mathew McDermott: Because the regulatory framework for this market is evolving, we needed to issue the digital bond in a jurisdiction that enabled us to achieve the clientâ\\x80\\x99s objective. Issuing under French law was a natural fit because the country passed a law that allows for the registration of digital securities to be recognized as financial securities; this permits the registration and transfer of unlisted securities using blockchain technology, removing the need for a central securities depositary (CSD) and a custodian. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not the case for many jurisdictions in many countries around the world, although Germany and Spain recently passed similar laws, and Luxembourg, Sweden and Singapore are working on similar legislation.  How does issuing a digital bond on the blockchain change the characteristics of the bond?  Maud Le Moine: The bond was a standard two-year 100 million euro-denominated bond but, because it was issued on the blockchain, it is in fully registered form and removed the need for a CSD and sharply reduced the settlement time. Normally, it takes five days after the transaction to settle debt issuance for the EIB, but because of the smart contract functionality and speed of transacting on the blockchain, we were able to settle it in one day. Theoretically, the transaction could have settled on the same day of issuance, but we wanted to give ourselves extra time since this was the first digital bond issuance in this format. Not only can using blockchain technology increase the speed and certainty of execution, as well as the efficiencies of transactions, it can also lower the transaction costs.  Mathew McDermott: Ultimately, issuers should be able to automate the entire lifecycle of their bond transactions on the blockchainâ\\x80\\x94certainly an area of focus of our net digital debt issuance. Reducing the settlement time to T+0, for example, reduces the settlement, operational and liquidity risks vis-à-vis existing issuances. Issuers also gain greater transparency to trading behavior on blockchain, albeit in a private way. And over the longer term, issuing debt on the blockchain would allow firms to appeal to a much broader investor base by leveraging the programmability of the technology to fractionalize the digital debt or any financial instrument. In other words, itâ\\x80\\x99s democratization in action.  So traditional finance relies on intermediaries to manage the process, but the EIB transaction in this case eliminated the need for a custodian. In the future will this replace the existing infrastructure players?  Mathew McDermott: In this transaction, EIB obviously did, but there are different jurisdictions where the rules and regulations are slightly different, so they could continue to interplay. The initial issuance is executed under a smart contract, so the debt and cash were separately represented using customized ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. And post issuance, in theory, the investors could just transact with each other on a peer-to-peer basis and notify the registrar to make the change in ownership, following confirmation fiat has moved from the settlement agent.  And when could we start to see other digital issuances?  Mathew McDermott: Over time you could see the marketplace migrate to issuing and secondary trading on a blockchain, however I would caveat we are still in the early stages of educating investors and issuers regarding adoption. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s exciting from my perspective is that weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing a lot of interest on the investor side, but weâ\\x80\\x99re also seeing a lot of appetite from issuers, as well. This is definitely a collaborative effort across the market.  Maud Le Moine: If you think about the evolution of capital markets and fixed income, weâ\\x80\\x99ve already moved from bearer bonds to the registration of all securities, so this is just the next step that will be the standard, given the efficiencies it brings. The interesting thing about this trade is because it was a multidealer public issuance, itâ\\x80\\x99s the first proper validation of the use of this technology that issuers can look to replicate.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 03 June 2021    With Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s shrinking working-age population expected to have a widespread impact on its economy, we sat down with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Maggie Wei, who recently published research analyzing the implications.  Earlier this week, China moved from a two-child policy to a three-child policy  in an attempt to raise the countryâ\\x80\\x99s birthrate. Do you expect this policy shift will pay off?  Maggie Wei: Our view is that itâ\\x80\\x99s likely to have a very small impact on overall population growth. When policymakers allowed couples to have two children in 2016, there was a 20% increase in new births but the effects have started to fade in recent years. Families are much less willing to have more than two children. For example, a 2020 survey conducted by the School of Social Development and Public Policy at Fudan University found that a majority of respondents considered having two children as â\\x80\\x9cideal.â\\x80\\x9d  So what could the path of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s population look like?  Maggie Wei: We ran an analysis projecting Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s overall population until 2030 under various scenarios. The upshot of our analysis is that Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s population will likely peak in the next few years. Even if the birth rate limitations were completely removed, barring other policy changes, the overall population will probably peak in the next five years. Additional measures to encourage fertility could also be announced. Other countries with declining populations, for example, have tried to boost fertility by directly compensating families for the economic cost of children through tax incentives and fiscal transfers, or by adding more support for mothers through parental leave entitlement and childcare provisions.  What impact could an aging population have on China's economy?  Maggie Wei: In our view, a shrinking working-age population will likely lower overall economic growth by reducing the potential GDP level and slowing potential GDP growth, holding labor productivity constant. In addition, population aging increases the burdens of supporting older people. Since working-age adults tend to work and save more than the young or those aged 60 and older, an economy with a greater working-age population is generally assumed to have higher savings rates, which would add to GDP growth by boosting investment rates. We do note that in China, however, the precautionary savings rate has been strong even for those aged 60 and older. Population aging would also change the structure of the economy, as the production-to-consumption ratio changes for different age groups. The typical life cycle theory suggests that people tend to consume less and save more during their working years but inevitably consume more as they age. As a result, we could see a negative correlation between the production-to-consumption ratio such that consumption increases as the working-age population drops.  And how could an aging population affect the interest rate landscape?  Maggie Wei: In terms of interest rates, aging populations could drive real rates in different directions. First, an aging population could reduce real interest rates, as potential economic growth tends to slow along with lower growth in the labor inputs. The demand for investment and return on capital, in turn, would then naturally decline. For example, academic research using a model of overlapping generations suggests that population aging could explain a large part of the decline in Japan's real interest rates over the past 50 years. Loanable fundsâ\\x80\\x94that is, household savings that are available for lendingâ\\x80\\x94could also increase or decrease along with population aging, depending on how people save. If the overall savings rate declines along with population aging, natural interest rates should increase, and vice versa. The linkage between population aging and inflation is complicated by monetary and fiscal policies and, relatedly, by the relative speed of adjustment between aggregate demand and supply. Taking Japan as an example, the countyâ\\x80\\x99s graying population was found to have created disinflationary pressures through declining overall economic growth, falling land prices and large fiscal consolidation needs.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 27 May 2021    Elizabeth Burton is the chief investment officer of the Employeesâ\\x80\\x99 Retirement System of the State of Hawaii, a $20 billion plan that serves about 135,000 peopleâ\\x80\\x94or roughly one out of every 10 people in the state. At a recent Goldman Sachs Asset Management Forum, she spoke with Katie Koch, co-head of the Fundamental Equity business, and Mike Swell, head of Global Portfolio Management within the Global Fixed Income team, about her views on inflation, asset allocation and the role of private assets.   Katie Koch: Elizabeth, just to take a step back, how are you thinking about the current economic environment and specifically, what's your outlook for inflation? This is an area that weâ\\x80\\x99re also spending a lot of time on, as weâ\\x80\\x99re starting to see aspects of inflation in some of our portfolio companies and in sectors such as materials and shippingâ\\x80\\x94though weâ\\x80\\x99re not yet seeing inflation reflected in wages.  Elizabeth Burton: So in general, one of my biggest concerns is that we could see a spike in inflation. Even if investors broadly expect that inflation could hit 2% or 3%, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a larger confidence interval around those estimates than ever. Meanwhile, the amount of tax revenues coming into the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s coffers is close to 75-year lows, even as the payouts are at all-time highs, so the growing budget deficit is certainly a growing concern. And when you look at three-year annualized returns across various sectors of the market, you can already see signs of higher prices. Agriculture prices, for example, have moved higher and youâ\\x80\\x99re seeing higher prices across the commodities sector, given recent supply-chain disruptions. We think inflation is higher than what is currently priced in.   Mike Swell: We would agree with you, Elizabeth, that the range of outcomes around inflation has widened, and certainly the real question may come down to the impact that 2021 has on 2022 returns. How does your view of higher inflation impact your asset allocation strategy?   Elizabeth Burton: Currently, we prefer equities and are still in bonds, as thereâ\\x80\\x99s pretty strong evidence that bonds do better in lower-inflation environments. And because of where the markets have been and our own rebalancing requirements, weâ\\x80\\x99ve had to keep rebalancing our equity holdings. So weâ\\x80\\x99ve had to keep capital moving from equities into fixed incomeâ\\x80\\x94such as long duration and TIPSâ\\x80\\x94until we can invest more in private and real assets. We also think other regions, such as Europeâ\\x80\\x94where, for example, the FTSE index is less weighted to techâ\\x80\\x94are looking more interesting, as are some value and quality assets, which also tend to hold up better in an inflationary environment.  Mike Swell: And how do you think about the role of private assets in your plan?   Elizabeth Burton: As a pension system, weâ\\x80\\x99re long-term players and care more about the long-term trajectory than whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening day to day in the markets. I would say that we skew toward private-market assets. When I first got here in 2018, we had a roughly 8% allocation to private equity, and today itâ\\x80\\x99s closer to 13%. In the Hawaii plan, we bucket our asset allocation into major risk factors, which has gotten us to thinking about investments in terms of beta and duration.   Katie Koch: We spend a lot of time on our teams thinking about how to set up our portfolios for an operating environment where cyclical stocks are likely to outperform in the short term as the economy opens up, yet technological disruption is creating a long-term deflationary impact across various sub-sectors. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s your view?   Elizabeth Burton: In terms of innovation, I think many of the tech companies and innovations of the last 15 years are going to look very different going forward. I also think weâ\\x80\\x99ll see innovations in different sectors, such as agriculture or in self-service consumer health. Overall, we have a low-risk equity book and we do have some funds that have more of a value tilt. As pressure to move into more ESG-oriented strategies mounts, many of those managers tend to have more of a value tilt embedded in them.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 20 May 2021    How has the healthcare sector fared during the pandemic? We spoke with Jenny Chang, a portfolio manager who covers healthcare for Goldman Sachs Asset Managementâ\\x80\\x99s Fundamental Equity team, on the sectors she and her team are focused on this year.  Can you give us a sense of how the COVID vaccine rollout is affecting the sector?  Jenny Chang: The demand for COVID vaccines is leading to a very tight demand-supply situation across the entire drug supply chain. There simply isnâ\\x80\\x99t enough supply to make all the drugs and vaccines to meet that demand. From our view, we expect the demand-supply conditions to persist for several years given that many countries outside the U.S. still need access to the vaccine. In addition, vaccine manufacturers, such as Moderna and Pfizer, are starting to work on annual booster shots that would provide protection against the different variants. We are also hearing that the booster shots may move to a prefilled syringe configuration compared to the current six doses per vial configuration.  If this is the case, it will make the already tight demand-supply dynamic even tighter.  And as economies emerge from the pandemic-induced lockdown, where do you expect to see pent-up demand?  Jenny Chang: One area that was severely disrupted last year was the medical-device sector, as many patients delayed elective surgeries. With vaccines rolling out, we think these companies are well positioned for recovery. In fact, the companiesâ\\x80\\x99 first-quarter results are confirming that trend with management teams commenting theyâ\\x80\\x99re seeing a sharp rebound in elective procedures which are nearly back to pre-COVID levels. So overall, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing encouraging signs of demand.  Has the pandemic led to any structural shifts in the sector?  Jenny Chang: The pandemic has brought unprecedented funding and investment into the entire healthcare ecosystem. As a result, we are seeing faster innovation and faster drug-development timelines. The best example of this is probably COVID vaccine development. The last new vaccine prior to COVID took four years to develop. This time around, it took one year to come up with the COVID vaccine. So something structurally has changed. Our view is healthcare innovation is at an inflection point, and weâ\\x80\\x99re continuing to focus our investments around innovation in the space. The overall setup and the outlook for the healthcare sector is quite positive over the next few years.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 23 April 2021  At a recent meeting of the Goldman Sachs Asset Management Forum, Mike Brandmeyer, global co-head and co-CIO of the Alternative Investments & Manager Selection Group, and Mike Koester, global co-head of the firmwide Alternatives Capital Markets & Strategy Group, discussed the state of private markets more than one year into the pandemic and how portfolio companies have fared during the crisis.  As economies across the world start to reopen, can you give us a sense of where the private equity (PE) industry stands today?  Mike Brandmeyer: The PE industry is stronger today than it was a year ago, largely due to key structural shifts that have been underway for more than a decade. Traditionally, PE firms had been primarily focused on leveraged buyouts of more mature, low-growth, asset-intensive businesses that were considered undervalued. Venture and growth equity were smaller parts of the market. In the wake of the financial crisis, younger, high-growth tech companies opted to remain private for longer given an abundance of private capital and the massive growth of the software industry. As a result, venture capital and growth equity firms gained market share while the traditional â\\x80\\x9cbuy it, fix it, sell itâ\\x80\\x9d LBO model waned in popularity. So PE firms shifted to buying more high-growth, asset-light businesses (often with software-as-a-service business models) and growing them with strong management teams. All of that helped to strengthen the average quality of the portfolio companies and their management teams.  So how did PE firms and portfolio companies fare during the pandemic?  Mike Koester: When the pandemic hit last spring, PE sponsors employed lessons learned from the financial crisis very quickly. Sponsors and portfolio company management teams were focused on cutting costs, conserving capital and ensuring there was enough liquidity to bridge them to the other side of the pandemic. Irrespective of whether companies operating in adversely affected industries or in businesses that were accelerated by the pandemic, sponsors were able to be agile and decisive in their decisions thanks in part to their ample liquidity positions and their concentrated ownership models. More broadly, powerful fiscal and monetary stimulus benefited the industry as a whole as central banks supported the credit and equity markets. Because of the aggressive intervention, there were far fewer restructurings of PE-backed companies than expected.  Can you give us a sense of the trends affecting portfolio companies in the private markets?  Mike Koester: Trends that weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing in our portfolio companies are not much different than those observed in publicly traded companies. As portfolio companies work their way through supply chain bottlenecks, theyâ\\x80\\x99re experiencing cost pressures through higher freight costs as well as rising wages, particularly in the U.S. where companies are competing with unemployment subsidies and stimulus incentives. Nevertheless, we expect these supply chain challenges and cost pressures to subside. As demand returns, we expect that earnings should exceed pre-COVID levels. Weâ\\x80\\x99re optimistic about the outlook for 2021 and 2022. CEO confidence is high as evidenced by their willingness to make investments and acquisitions.  Finally, whatâ\\x80\\x99s your view on the level of SPAC activity in the market and how does that affect PE firms?  Mike Koester: SPACs are an important capital market innovation as they provide companies with another way of going public besides traditional IPOs and direct listings. Many companies, including certain high-growth businesses that require a lot of capital to support that growth, are most efficiently funded in the public markets. That said, the traditional IPO path doesnâ\\x80\\x99t make sense for all companies. Going public via a SPAC allows companies to discuss their long-term growth forecasts, a limitation when listing via traditional IPO. For the PE industry, SPACs represent another potential path to liquidity for our portfolio companies.  Mike Brandmeyer: With respect to the level of activity, I do think there are signs of excessâ\\x80\\x94so far in 2021, SPAC launches have already eclipsed last yearâ\\x80\\x99s record of 250. Looking ahead, the performance and success of SPACs will be entirely dependent on execution. Winners in the space will likely be the SPACs with experienced sponsors and stronger structures that better align incentives upfront.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 16 April 2021  The simultaneous pickup in economic growth and inflationâ\\x80\\x94or reflationâ\\x80\\x94following the hit to both during the COVID-19 pandemic has revived investorsâ\\x80\\x99 appetite for riskier assets. Unprecedented levels of fiscal stimulus have helped boost momentum. While stronger growth should sustain that trend into the second quarter, returns on risky assets like equities will likely slow from here, says Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Christian Mueller-Glissmann. We sat down with Christian to dig into his outlook across asset classes for the year to come.  Christian, how do you expect global equities to move over the next 12 months?  Christian Mueller-Glissmann: We remain broadly pro-risk in our asset allocation and are overweight equities over both a three- and a 12-month horizon. Within the asset class, we prefer non-U.S. over U.S. stocks, a position that reflects the opportunities we see in cyclical, value and short-duration equities. We have shifted from industrial to consumer cyclical sectors and themes to position for the reopening of economies.  Your Risk Appetite Indicator currently sits at an elevated level. What are the implications for investorsâ\\x80\\x99 asset allocation strategies?  Christian Mueller-Glissmann: Our measure of risk appetite has climbed materially since the beginning of 2021 amid the bullish shift and reflation optimism in global markets. That means adding risk from here becomes trickier and portfolios become more vulnerable to negative growth and rate shocks. Growth and reflation optimism should be able to sustain risk appetite at high levels: Our economistsâ\\x80\\x99 macro outlook continues to be positive, so we donâ\\x80\\x99t think bullish positioning and sentiment alone have been reasons enough to reduce risk. Still, the increased risk appetite will likely act as a speed limit to equity returns.  What about other asset classes?  Christian Mueller-Glissmann: We remain bullish on commodities. Given the recent weakness in oil prices, weâ\\x80\\x99ve moved to an overweight position from neutral over a three-month horizon and remain overweight over 12 months. In periods of high and rising inflation, commodities can act as a diversifier for balanced portfolios: When equities and bonds have declined together due to inflation risks, commodities have often decoupled and offered attractive carry. We remain neutral on credit and underweight on bonds. Growth optimism will likely persist and longer-dated yield levels remain low even after their recent advance, which should continue to push investors towards riskier pockets of the market.  What are investors most worried about right now?  Christian Mueller-Glissmann: Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been hearing concerns over the prospect of a deeper bond sell-off and larger-than-expected increase in inflation as global growth momentum accelerates. We expect fears over hawkish monetary policy and inflation risk to eventually fade. In our view, the reflation trend will likely continue in the near term. While there is potential for an inflation overshoot, a transition to a â\\x80\\x9cGoldilocksâ\\x80\\x9d scenario into year-endâ\\x80\\x94 with growth still robust but the bond sell-off easingâ\\x80\\x94is most consistent with our forecasts. This should eventually create opportunities to add exposure to long-duration assets and carry strategies. Until then, higher allocations to real assets such as commodities can help reduce risks from high inflation for balanced portfolios.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 09 April 2021  Amid concerns that Europe and China are facing economic and demographic headwinds similar to those responsible for Japanâ\\x80\\x99s decades-long period of anemic growth, we sat down with Naohiko Baba, Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s chief economist for Japan, to discuss how Japan is coping with its challenges and takeaways for other countries that are at risk of â\\x80\\x98Japanification.â\\x80\\x99  Baba-san, to set the stage, can you explain the concept of â\\x80\\x98Japanificationâ\\x80\\x99 and why it is relevant now?  Naohiko Baba: Japanification refers to the combination of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates that has plagued Japan since the collapse of its real estate bubble in the early 1990s. Our analysis suggests that it was triggered by a structural stagnation in economic growth potential caused by an aging demographic. Concerns about Japanification have been rising recently in Europe and particularly in China, where the working-age population is projected to decline significantly. Interestingly, however, despite its demographic headwinds, Japan's economy has still managed to grow, albeit modestly.  But isnâ\\x80\\x99t Japanâ\\x80\\x99s population in terminal decline?  Naohiko Baba: Yes, it is true that Japanâ\\x80\\x99s working-age population has been declining since the mid-1990s. And historically leading economic indicatorsâ\\x80\\x94including GDP, number of workers, capital stock and bank lendingâ\\x80\\x94rise and fall in tandem with the growth in the working-age population. But in recent years, we have seen these economic indicators strengthen and effectively decouple from the impact of changes in the working-age population. Instead, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing economic indicators exhibit a stronger correlation with overall GDP.  So how has Japan been able to push back against these demographic headwinds?  Naohiko Baba: Despite its aging population, Japan has managed to increase the total number of workers. The participation rate among the working-age population rose to 80% in 2019 from 74% in 2010, driven by a prominent rise in the labor participation rate among women and the elderly. In addition, we have seen a secular pickup in capital expenditures as companies look to improve efficiencies. Rising capex has made the greatest contribution to GDP growth since 2010, with particularly strong growth in digital investment among non-manufacturers that are facing severe labor shortages. In addition, as interest in relocating production facilities overseas has tapered off, domestic capex has increased in recent years as manufacturers look to replace obsolete facilities with more efficient ones. Finally, a return of the positive correlation between bank lending and capital stock suggests that banks have likely played a pivotal role in driving capex, by lending proactively amid a low-interest rate environment.  What are some takeaways for other countries?  Naohiko Baba: Japan was the first developed economy to experience a deterioration in demographics, so it was slow to realize the implications and unable to learn from other countriesâ\\x80\\x99 experiences. However, the country has managed to avoid a structural contraction in economic activity by reversing the strong positive correlation once seen between the working-age population and economic activity. We believe that Japanâ\\x80\\x99s experience could provide useful lessons for other countries such as raising the labor participation rates among the elderly and women and increasing the number of foreign workers. Businesses also need to find substitutes for human labor by aggressively leveraging automation and digital investment, especially in the labor-intensive service sector. Additionally, banks could provide full support for corporate capex and other relevant activities aimed at enhancing productivity in response to worsening demographics. While GDP is influenced by a variety of factors including external demand and fiscal spending, Japanâ\\x80\\x99s example suggests that demographic headwinds can at least partially be offset through self-help efforts on the labor supply, capital stock and financial fronts.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 25 March 2021  More than one year into the pandemic and in the wake of the conclusion of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s 14th National Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s Congress, investors are focusing on how the country will achieve its announced growth target of 6%. At a recent Goldman Sachs Asset Management Forum session, Prakriti Sofat, a portfolio manager who invests in emerging markets, explained the key economic drivers for China this year.  China just completed its Two Sessions, the countryâ\\x80\\x99s biggest political and economic gathering of the year, where the government said it would target growth of more than 6% in 2021. What is the significance of that target?  Prakriti Sofat: The 6% growth target is quite a low threshold given the median consensus forecast of about 8.5%. The government is using a conservative growth forecast primarily because of its focus on structural reform, innovation and the qualityâ\\x80\\x94rather than the quantityâ\\x80\\x94of growth. The goal is to rotate the economy to be consumption-led, environmentally conscious and technology-oriented. During the Two Sessions, China also reiterated its commitment to reduce carbon emissions 18% by 2025 and achieve net zero emissions by 2060, which is significant given that China is the worldâ\\x80\\x99s largest coal consumer.  Given the increased focus on qualitative factors, how will government policy evolve in 2021?  Prakriti Sofat: We expect less policy support for a start. Policymakers in China are always balancing the tradeoff between using policy to increase economic growth versus maintaining financial stability and containing leverage. As leverage in the countryâ\\x80\\x99s economy has built up, the government started to shift its focus toward financial stability in the third quarter of last year. This year, policy normalization will entail a notable deceleration in credit growth, a smaller fiscal deficit, marginally tighter housing policies and stable monetary policy. This should help China stabilize the countryâ\\x80\\x99s debt-to-GDP ratio at just under 300%.  How would you characterize Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s economic growth last year?  Prakriti Sofat: China was â\\x80\\x9cfirst in, first outâ\\x80\\x9d of COVID-19. The Chinese economy grew 2.3% in 2020, and its GDP closed the year 6% above the fourth quarter 2019 levels. In fact, China was one of the few economies whose GDP surpassed its pre-pandemic GDP levels in 2020. Solid export demand, industrial production, infrastructure investment and real estate activity all fueled growth last year, but consumption and services lagged.  What do you see as the economic drivers in 2021?  Prakriti Sofat: We expect manufacturing activity and increased household consumption will be the main drivers of economic growth this year. The manufacturing sector has faced many headwinds in recent years in part because of U.S.-China trade tensions, which created uncertainty for corporates, as well as a fall in domestic demand and investment in the sector last year. But there are a number of tailwinds for the sector in 2021. For one, Chinese exports actually accelerated in the first few months of 2021 at a time when we are seeing improved global growth outlooks, so the strong export demand is continuing to support investments in manufacturing. In addition, capacity utilization is rising, corporate profits are improving and there is demand to upgrade industrial equipment. On the consumption side, while retail sales are still lagging behind other sectors in the economy, we expect the rollout of the vaccine, employment gains, income growth, and, to some degree, an unwinding of excess savings will help normalize contact-based services, and related retail and consumption activity.  And how is 2021 shaping up so far?  Prakriti Sofat: Early 2021 activity data was mixed. Data from January and February showed a broad-based acceleration in exports across product types and destinations, and solid industrial production activity. However, retail sales growth was weak amid stringent restrictions to control a mild rise in COVID-19 cases. For example, hotel occupancy rates dropped from 60% in December to 20% but have started improving since late February. Weâ\\x80\\x99re keeping a close eye on manufacturing investmentâ\\x80\\x94which we expect to be a core driver of growth in 2021â\\x80\\x94as activity has weakened significantly in recent weeks. That said, the low base of 2020 should almost guarantee a significantly above-trend growth rate.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 19 March 2021  With markets hitting new highs, are equity valuations at a peak? We sat down with Candice Tse, U.S. head of Market Strategy within the Strategic Advisory Solutions team in Goldman Sachs' Asset Management Division, who shared her view on the current valuations.   Candice, with markets continuing to set new records, are equities getting too expensive?  Candice Tse: Weâ\\x80\\x99re getting a lot of questions from investors about current valuations. On an absolute basis, valuations are high across many traditional metrics. By most measuresâ\\x80\\x94including Price/Book, CAPE and Forward P/E ratiosâ\\x80\\x94stocks are trading in the top decile historically. At these high levels, itâ\\x80\\x99s no surprise that investors are contemplating the risk-reward tradeoff of investing in U.S. equities. On a relative basis compared to Treasury yields, equities are more fairly valued. But even operating under the assumption of elevated valuations, our analysis shows that the equity market can stay expensive for years, especially when paired with accommodative policy and stable inflation. In fact, the last 10 years are a great example. Valuations have remained consistently high over the last decade, yet the U.S. equity market, as measured by the S&P 500 Index, was still able to generate 227% in cumulative total returns during that time as of Feb 1, 2021.  What does the recent volatility in equities mean for investors?  Candice Tse: Moments of volatility may actually present potential opportunities to invest. While valuations matter, economic fundamentals can matter even more. Research shows that the early stages of an economic recovery are often accompanied by bullish market sentiment thatâ\\x80\\x99s driven by recovering fundamentals and a favorable growth picture. Historical S&P 500 data tells us that economic expansions have generated positive returns 87% of the time; and 67% of the time, returns were at least 10%.  So whatâ\\x80\\x99s your outlook for equity markets this year?  Candice Tse: We remain pro-risk. Our view of risk assets, particularly in global equities is supported by a number of factors including recovering global growth, double digit corporate profits, limited need for structural repair, continued policy support and relatively low global interest rates. Even as the S&P 500 was up 78% from the market bottom in 2020 as of March 17, 2021, those gains only reflect one-fifth of the median returns seen during the last four expansionary cycles. These past equity rallies lasted for a median of 109 months with gains over 400% from the market bottoms. We expect that broader vaccination efforts, warmer weather and a cyclical rally from COVID-19-sensitive sectors are likely to extend tailwinds that will be supportive of the equity market despite high equity valuations. Ultimately, our expectation for double-digit returns this year is supported by a sharp V-shaped recovery due to the vaccine rollout, and supportive fiscal and monetary policies.

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 12 March 2021  Just over a year into Goldman Sachs' 10-year plan to deploy $750 billion toward accelerating the climate transition and advancing inclusive growth, the firm has reached a fifth of its target. We sat down with John Goldstein, head of the firmâ\\x80\\x99s Sustainable Finance Group, to discuss progress, client concerns and the impact of the pandemic on companiesâ\\x80\\x99 sustainability goals.   John, soon after the firm announced its sustainability goal in late 2019, the world went into lockdown. Can you describe how the pandemic affected companiesâ\\x80\\x99 sustainability objectives in 2020?   John Goldstein: Last year was undoubtedly a year of volatility and complexity, but the one constant was the growing interest and focus in sustainable finance and ESG as evidenced by the fact that in 2020 alone we reached a fifth of our $750 billion 10-year target. The pandemic served as a stress test for the industryâ\\x80\\x94which it passed with flying colors. The strong performance of ESG investments during the first-quarter downturn was rewarded with greater focus and capital flows as the year progressed. In addition, the pandemic reminded people of how quickly the world can change and how important these emerging changes can be to portfolios. Factors that may not have always been incorporated in traditional financial models can have significant financial impacts. From our perspective, 2020 highlighted the importance of both elements of our sustainability approach which focuses on two interconnected themes: climate transition and inclusive growth.  Can you describe the firmâ\\x80\\x99s approach to sustainabilityâ\\x80\\x94how did you come to decide on these two themes?  John Goldstein: When we first announced our sustainability approach in 2019, people immediately understood the focus on climate transition, but were less certain about the focus on inclusive growth. Well, 2020 was a stark reminder that both pillars are essential. The pandemic gave us a health and employment crisis while highlighting the deeply visible manifestations of the ongoing racial inequalities, particularly in the U.S. You could say that the social component of ESG has climbed into the front seat with the environmental concerns.   So letâ\\x80\\x99s talk about how the first year of allocating capital went. How did the firm approach making its targets a reality?  John Goldstein: A big part of achieving our goal during the first year stemmed from the fact that we were able to leverage the strengths across the organization. Soon after we announced our 10-year target, we created a new team, the Sustainable Finance Group, to coordinate our sustainability efforts across the firm. Shortly thereafter, we launched dedicated sustainability councils within all of our businesses, each led by a senior leader within the firm, to integrate sustainability solutions into our work with clients.  What's an example?   John Goldstein: One example I would highlight is the work that we did with our Global Markets Division where we incorporated ESG data into the divisionâ\\x80\\x99s trading capabilities. That in turn helped clients achieve their ESG goals either broadly or in specific areas, such as lowering their carbon footprint in their portfolios. We essentially served as a product incubator within divisions to understand the market need for new strategies for their clients. The division, in turn, scaled the products and strategies more broadly.   What types of strategies resonated most with clients?   John Goldstein: Climate solutions were a key focus for clients across the firm. For example, weâ\\x80\\x99ve worked with our colleagues in the Asset Management Division to provide growth financing to Swedish manufacturer Northvolt AB to support the construction of a lithium-ion battery factory that will expand the market for electric vehicles in Europe. For our public market investors, weâ\\x80\\x99ve developed ESG strategies in our trading and asset management businesses and are accelerating global power solutions through our structuring services in the Global Markets Division. In the Investment Banking Division, we were part of the largest corporate sustainability bond for Alphabet; the largest IPO for a solar company, Shoals Technologies; and helped clients issue more than $35 billion in COVID-19 relief bonds. What weâ\\x80\\x99ve learned is that there are multiple ways to help clients meet their decarbonization goals across the firm. In fact, making sustainability a core commercial focus for us has not only allowed us to scale ESG and inclusive growth strategies across the breadth and depth of our organization to meet our clientsâ\\x80\\x99 goals, but doing so has also enabled us to tie it into our own funding strategy as we recently did with the issuance of our $800 million green bond.  Finally, what do you see as the key ESG and sustainability priorities for companies this year?   John Goldstein: Investors and corporates are all looking at moving sustainability considerations from the periphery to the core of their organizations. That means that for investors, itâ\\x80\\x99s not just about ESG productsâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s about all of their investing products. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not about their sustainability reportâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s about their annual report. For us, our focus will continue to remain on incubating and launching new product offerings within our divisions in partnership with our clients andâ\\x80\\x94in particularâ\\x80\\x94to accelerate our efforts to work as one firm to meet clientsâ\\x80\\x99 needs.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 04 March 2021  In recent weeks, a sharp move higher in Treasury yields has triggered a sell-off in the rates market, which is starting to spill over into other assets. We sat down with Goldman Markets Divisionâ\\x80\\x99s Josh Schiffrin, global co-head of U.S. and global interest rate products, and Brian Friedman, global head of market strats, who explain the market implications.  In recent weeks, there has been a wave of selling that has driven the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to its highest level since the pandemic began. Why did the yields move up so quickly?  Josh Schiffrin: Whatâ\\x80\\x99s happened in February is fundamentally different than the factors that drove the market over the last six months. The market is now looking toward future growth and what a return to normal would look like as COVID-19 cases fall and vaccinations increase. In other words, the trade has shifted from a pure reflationary one to a view that the economy is recovering sooner than expected and the market is reassessing the growth outlook and implications thereof. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s more, the composition of the move, to the extent it continues, may be different than the pure reflation trade weâ\\x80\\x99re accustomed to and, in fact, is likely to reflect a more dynamic trading environment.  From your many conversations across the franchise, are you getting the sense that people are positioned for this?  Brian Friedman: Despite the marketâ\\x80\\x99s focus on the reflation trade, there was a great deal of complacency priced into the market, as could be seen in historically low volatility and a very slow and shallow hiking cycle. There is a pronounced difference between the long period we were just in, where you had slowing global growth and central banks were making sure real rates globally were repricing even lower, to one now where global growth is going to be growing quite strongly and central banks will now be in the position of trying to anchor real rates from repricing too quickly. That kind of shift is going to obviously affect what assets investors are going to be long. The future period of stronger growth and allowing for higher inflation calls for the market to be long real assetsâ\\x80\\x94equities, commodities and real estateâ\\x80\\x94all of which have unlimited upside to growth instead of nominal assets. And as the economy and asset prices start to reflate, we expect to see higher volatility given the procyclical nature of Fed policy, and higher economic volatility emanating from enormous pent-up demand due to the pandemic and historically large fiscal packages.  What is the biggest focus from a macro perspective that youâ\\x80\\x99re watching?  Josh Schiffrin: The central thing thatâ\\x80\\x99s happened in the world over the last year is this terrible virus. Central banksâ\\x80\\x99 stimulus and fiscal stimulus are all a response to the virusâ\\x80\\x94and higher rates would reflect a return to normalcy.   Brian Friedman: Iâ\\x80\\x99m watching the 5-year Treasury and what a possible infrastructure package may look like. Itâ\\x80\\x99s much easier for the Fed to control the 5-year point of the curve. The negative correlation between break-even ratesâ\\x80\\x94a measure of expected annual inflationâ\\x80\\x94and real rates has remained high. And so long as the 5-year point of the curve is broadly contained as break-even rates move higher, then thatâ\\x80\\x99s a strong indication that the Fed is staying dovish while growth prospects improveâ\\x80\\x94 and itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to get bearish on risk if growth is improving and the Fed is remaining dovish. And outside of getting the virus under control, the next important piece of information for the market to debate and digest, will be an infrastructure plan coming out of Washington. Details are scarce and itâ\\x80\\x99s an area the market has very little conviction around.  Finally, can you outline your views for the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s playbook over the next few years?  Josh Schiffrin: We expect the Fed to start tapering bond purchases in 2022 and finish by the end of 2022 or early 2023. From there, we expect the Fed could start to raise interest rates by 25 basis points a quarter, most likely starting in early 2024.  Brian Friedman: Ultimately, I think the Fed is going to let the economy run as hot as it can to get the unemployment rateâ\\x80\\x94including the participation rate and minority employment rateâ\\x80\\x94as low as possible. And I think the only thing that will force them to blink and raise rates is if inflation becomes uncomfortably high.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 26 February 2021  In times of uncertainty, Switzerland, long known as a safe haven for financial assets, has benefited from strong investor inflows. We sat down with Dominique Wohnlich, head of Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Private Wealth Management business in Switzerland, to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the business and what clients there are focused on.  Dominique, can you give us a sense of the concerns that are top of mind for your clients right now?    Dominique Wohnlich: Clients are clearly still concerned about COVID-19, as countries across Europe struggle with the distribution of the vaccine. In Switzerland, there have been about 500,000 infections in a population of about 8.5 million, although we expect a large proportion of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s population to be vaccinated by the end of the second quarter. And given expectations of stronger global growth in an environment of low-for-longer interest rates, clients are looking to increase their allocation to risk assets, specifically to public equities and private markets.  Did the pandemic have any impact on clientsâ\\x80\\x99 investment strategies?  Dominique Wohnlich: Since many of our clients were unsettled by the market upheaval and concerned about their familiesâ\\x80\\x99 health and safety, our conversations with them increased sharply. The majority of our clients initially focused on creating more short-term liquidity, although many remained actively invested in the markets. Still, the crisis affected our clients in different ways. Many businesses had to re-evaluate their financing structure to diversify and improve flexibility, while others with tech-focused operations benefited from the digital acceleration across industries. And some clients with exposure to the European hospitality or tourism sectors faced some difficulties. Throughout those conversations, we emphasized the importance of staying invested.   Tell us more about the investment landscape in Switzerland. Why is it considered an important financial hub?  Dominique Wohnlich: There are really two primary reasons: the countryâ\\x80\\x99s banking system and Switzerland itself. Switzerlandâ\\x80\\x99s banking system holds about $4 trillion in private assets, of which about two-thirds are from investors and families domiciled outside of the country. Overall debt levels are relatively healthy with the countryâ\\x80\\x99s national debt amounting to about 41% of gross domestic product in 2019â\\x80\\x94a figure that is estimated to remain below 50% in the coming years. In addition, the countryâ\\x80\\x99s strong data protection framework is becoming increasingly important to wealthy clients looking to protect their familiesâ\\x80\\x99 privacy. And aside from being one of the wealthiest countries in the world, the Swiss franc is considered a safe-haven currency. In fact, any time there is a global crisis, the country sees significant asset inflows.    Looking ahead in 2021, what are some of your priorities and opportunities you see in the region?  Dominique Wohnlich: One of our priorities is to build on our commitment to the region and long experience in managing money for international families. The population is expanding and with it, the countryâ\\x80\\x99s aggregate wealth, which makes it an exciting time to be in the market. Along those lines, we have a presence in Zurich, recently re-activated our office in Geneva and have been hiring top talent to expand our business here. As far as investment themes, sustainable finance is a key focus for our clients in the region, especially now that Europe has embarked on the path to become the worldâ\\x80\\x99s first climate-neutral continent by 2050 and has announced a new Green Deal that will drive economic recovery. In fact, our largest clients are committing substantial capital to ESG and impact strategies. Beyond that, since COVID-19 has created a situation where the return outlook for high-quality fixed income is challenging in most European countries in the near future, our clients are looking to generate returns through growth sectors, such as technology, or by looking to invest in higher-growth jurisdictions as well as in alternative asset classes, such as private equity.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 18 February 2021  Could bitcoin replace gold as a store of value? According to long-time cryptocurrency enthusiast Mike Novogratz, founder of Galaxy Investment Partners, bitcoin, blockchain and decentralized finance are poised to disrupt the payment and financial services ecosystem. Goldman Sachs Asset Managementâ\\x80\\x99s Katie Koch, co-head of the Fundamental Equity business, and Nora Creedon, global head of REIT and infrastructure strategies, spoke with Novogratz, a former Goldman Sachs partner, at a recent GSAM Forum event.   Katie Koch: So Mike, in the GSAM Forum, we love to speak to early adopters of disruptive trends and you were among the first institutional investors to focus on cryptocurrencies. Given market attention on the first and most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin, how should we view it relative to a traditional currency â\\x80\\x93 is it a store of value and efficient medium of exchange like fiat currency?   Mike Novogratz: Bitcoin should be viewed as a store of value, akin to a â\\x80\\x9cdigital version of gold.â\\x80\\x9d Its value amounts to 6% of gold today but could rise to 10% by the end of the year and surpass gold in value at some point in the next three to four years. There are 118 elements in the periodic table, yet gold is the only element to be designated safe-haven status. The same designation can extend to bitcoin in a digitized world, especially given growing risk of debasement of fiat currencies and raised prospects of a higher inflation regime â\\x80\\x93 the political environment is in favor of lower inequality even if it entails higher inflation. Scarcity will also reinforce its value given there is a finite amount of bitcoins, around 21 million, though 2 to 3 million are thought to have been misplaced.   Nora Creedon: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital payment adoption and in turn the pace of digital currency development, including at central banks which are focused on benefits including broader financial inclusion and potentially improved transmission of monetary policy. What are your thoughts on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and which cryptocurrencies and technologies should we be focused on?   Mike Novogratz: The DNA of bitcoinâ\\x80\\x94blockchainâ\\x80\\x94is revolutionary and will be the foundation for both private and public digital payments efforts. Last year, the Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s Bank of China launched pilot programs for a digital currency. Central banks in Europe and Japan are also exploring their own CBDCs. There are more $100 denomination bills held outside the U.S. than $1 bills in domestic circulation, making it critical for the U.S. to consider a digital currency if the dollar is to retain its reserve currency status. In the private space, Venmo is essentially a digital currency, though transaction values are capped, and there are other digital currencies in the works such as Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s Diem. For cryptocurrencies, Ethereum blockchain is essential to facilitating payments in a decentralized manner; it can be thought of as a supercomputer that processes and authenticates dataâ\\x80\\x94call it Web 3.0. More broadly, decentralized finance is set to disrupt many corners of traditional finance and at a faster rate than I could have imagined.  Katie Koch: Enthusiasm for bitcoin is evident among millennial and Gen Z generations, perhaps given their familiarity with the digital world, but weâ\\x80\\x99ve also seen high-profile institutional investors get involved. Given baby boomers have adopted millennial behaviors such as online shopping and streaming this past year, should we expect them to venture into bitcoin also?   Mike Novogratz: Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the hope! Demand from baby boomers has potential to be a significant tailwind for bitcoin in 2021 as private wealth managers launch bitcoin funds. In my view, itâ\\x80\\x99s not a matter of will it happen, itâ\\x80\\x99s a matter of when it will happen.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 11 February 2021  The hospitals and healthcare systems that are critical to managing our health are also a significant part of the institutional investor landscape. We sat down with Paget MacColl, co-head of the Americas Institutional Client Business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM), to discuss the results of GSAMâ\\x80\\x99s 2020 Healthcare Diagnostic, an annual survey assessing the investment approaches and practices of 42 leading healthcare systems and hospitals across the U.S. representing more than $350 billion in investments.  Last year was certainly a difficult year for institutional investors as they faced the challenges of the pandemic and market volatility. How did healthcare organizations fare?  Paget MacColl: COVID-19 meaningfully impacted hospital systems both operationally and financially. Because hospitals and healthcare systems rely more heavily on their investment portfolios to fund growth than corporate and public plans, they were very focused on liquidity management early in the pandemic. But fewer respondents to our latest annual survey see liquidity shortfall as a top concern, possibly reflecting inflows from federal funding and credit facilities. More broadly, the pandemic has exposed challenges to hospital systems that are being addressed through a refined focus on liquidity management, dynamic investment decisions, as well as increased collaboration across the governance structure.  Given that the challenging operating environment is likely to continue for some time, whatâ\\x80\\x99s top of mind for healthcare organizations this year?  Paget MacColl: Based on our survey, healthcare organizations appear more bearish on the investment outlook, with at least 50% of respondents saying they were more worried about a greater number of risksâ\\x80\\x94including operational pressures, geopolitical turmoil, recession and a failure to meet return objectivesâ\\x80\\x94than prior years. However, concern around a liquidity shortfall decreased slightly from last year, while concerns around the path of interest rates have increased.  Given the increased concerns, how are healthcare systems thinking about their asset allocation strategies?  Paget MacColl: Overall, organizations remain bullish on private markets and risk assets broadly as they seek to generate long-term investment returns. Similar to 2019, private markets remain a key focus and are one of the most likely asset classes to see increased allocations. Investors are notably more bullish on equities: 30% say that they plan to increase exposure in the year ahead, versus 18% in 2019. Allocations to cash and short-term securities are the most likely to decrease this year, potentially reflecting cash buffers and inflows following the CARES Act. Respondents also appear more bullish on hedge funds, with 76% indicating they will maintain or increase exposure, compared with 61% in 2019. What was interesting this year was that about half of respondents have implemented ESG into their investment program, a significant increase from 29% two years ago. The majority of those who have implemented ESG approaches chose to do so by integrating ESG factors into the investment process in search of better performance.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 28 January 2021  Companies evaluating mergers and acquisitions are increasingly looking at how the transaction may impact their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy, according to Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Avinash Mehrotra, global head of the Activism and Shareholder Advisory and Takeover Defense practices. We sat down with Avi to discuss how ESG considerations are starting to influence deal-making.  Avi, can you describe the role of ESG in companiesâ\\x80\\x99 M&A strategies?   Avinash Mehrotra: Strategic fit and financial profile remain the most important factors driving a companyâ\\x80\\x99s M&A strategy. The ESG rationale can be thought of as oneâ\\x80\\x94albeit increasingly importantâ\\x80\\x94component of assessing strategic fit. In some transactions, improving a companyâ\\x80\\x99s ESG profile may be the primary driver behind the strategic rationale for the transaction. In other deals, the ESG rationale may play a more minor roleâ\\x80\\x94if the ESG impact from the deal is neutral, for example. In the current environment, as companies evaluate a potential deal, they are more likely to consider the transactionâ\\x80\\x99s effect on their carbon footprint, supply chains, and social impact, and to incorporate assumptions about those factors into their valuations. Where a company is evaluating a target with a different ESG profile than its own, positive differences in ESG footprints and disclosure practices may be a source of synergies. In other situations, drastic differences in buyer and target ESG profiles can even scuttle deals.  How is ESG entering the deal process? Are companies screening for ESG considerations when theyâ\\x80\\x99re looking at potential acquisitions?  Avinash Mehrotra: ESG considerations are becoming an important part of identifying M&A targets and performing due diligence on them. Understanding differences in buyer and seller ESG profiles often cuts to the heart of the social and cultural norms of the organizations and those norms have always been essential to successful M&A. When companies acquire targets with a meaningfully different ESG profile, it can create cultural tensions between the employee bases and broader stakeholder communities. It is critical then that integration strategies contemplate what the pro forma ESG profile of the combined business will be and the effect that profile is likely to have on the targetâ\\x80\\x99s stakeholders. At a minimum, companies want to make sure theyâ\\x80\\x99re philosophically aligned. Weâ\\x80\\x99re working more frequently with companies to also explain the ESG benefits of an acquisition upon announcement. These kinds of disclosures are still in their early stages, but companies understand the potential benefits of announcing an acquisition that is ESG accretive. Conversely, if merger partners donâ\\x80\\x99t address ESG benefits or the strategy for mitigating potential ESG risks, that can raise investor concerns. The mere fact that ESG is now considered a risk factor, alongside reputational risk and cyber risk, speaks to its growing prominence in deal-making.   But to gain an accurate picture of ESG-related risks and opportunities, acquiring companies need to have good data. So is the lack of standardization around ESG reporting a problem?  Avinash Mehrotra: The lack of standardization is a less significant issue in an M&A context because, unlike a retail or institutional investor which may rely on ESG scores, a merger partner is usually going to be involved in a deeper level of diligence to understand the targetâ\\x80\\x99s disclosures and practices. On balance, having a more reliable and standardized system of disclosure will certainly facilitate public diligence, but is unlikely to be sufficient for most deals to reach announcement. One important way ESG disclosures influence M&A may be through their impact on relative valuations of those companies with ESG-friendly profiles and best-in-class disclosures from those without. Weâ\\x80\\x99re already seeing that the cost of capital or financing for companies with better ESG scores can be lower than the cost of capital for companies with poorer ESG scores. For instance, there is higher investor demand and better pricing for issuers for many green, social, or sustainable bonds versus traditional (non-ESG) issuances.  ESG has certainly been a key focus for investors. How is that impacting corporate strategy?   Avinash Mehrotra: The growth of the assets under management in ESG-focused funds is important because if the investor baseâ\\x80\\x94particularly the next younger generation of investorsâ\\x80\\x94cares about these issues, that will set the tone for how these funds push forward the ESG agenda. And since those funds are meaningful shareholders in many large companies, that will in turn influence corporate behavior. Companies have noticed that ESG-oriented capital is now the fastest growing segment of the asset management industry and that global, non-ESG fund flows have been contracting. While ESG investing may have initially gained momentum among European pension funds, it is now a fully globalized phenomenon and US-based fundsâ\\x80\\x94both active and passiveâ\\x80\\x94are rapidly catching up. Additionally, shareholder activists have identified ESG improvements on their growing list of demands when targeting companies. In response, companies are shifting their disclosures, behavior, and culture toward more ESG-friendly practices, and we, along with our colleagues across many parts of Goldman Sachs, are advising our clients on that journey.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 21 January 2021  Goldman Sachs recently hosted the first day of its three-day virtual Technology and Internet Conference, which convened leaders from 75 of the most influential companies in the space. We sat down with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Heath Terry, business unit leader for the Technology, Media and Telecom Group, who shared highlights from the event. The second part of the conference will be held virtually on February 10-11.   Heath, can you describe the overall sentiment from the event?   Heath Terry: The optimism was fairly prevalent throughout the presentations and client conversations in large part because of improving sentiment around the eventual economic and pandemic recovery and, of course, the strong capital markets. The levels of market and many measures of business activity are, in fact, near record highs. Many of the newer companies that attended were either customersâ\\x80\\x94or potential customersâ\\x80\\x94of most of the public companies that were presenting at the conference. And many had recently gone public via an initial public offerings or SPACs.  So, whatâ\\x80\\x99s driving the pickup in strategic activity in this sector?   Heath Terry: To understand the current underlying fundamentals, itâ\\x80\\x99s helpful to look back to early in the pandemicâ\\x80\\x94during the March to May period, for exampleâ\\x80\\x94when companies were focused on ensuring that their businesses could continue as usual, while securing their data centers and helping their people work from home. Then, starting in June, many companies saw their customers pull back on discretionary spending given the uncertainty over the virus, elections and the economy. That cautiousness, however, reversed course during the fourth quarter amid encouraging vaccine developments while the stock market rallied, helping to bolster CEO, CIO and CFO sentiment. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s when we saw companies sign new contracts, begin new cloud migrations and start to deploy their savings. So we really saw a renewed sense of optimism coming out of the fourth quarter and heading into 2021, especially given expectations of larger stimulus packages and a potential end to the pandemic.   What sectors are particularly active?   Heath Terry: Data analytics and cloud software companies are among the most active in the current environment, especially as many small businessesâ\\x80\\x94which are still under tremendous pressureâ\\x80\\x94turn to software and technology generally to reduce costs and improve productivity. One of the CEOs at the conference noted that while bank balances at small- and medium-sized businesses were down about 20 to 25% over year-ago levelsâ\\x80\\x94and down about 75% for companies in the most affected sectorsâ\\x80\\x94they were leveraging cloud software and software-as-a-service systems in data analytics to cut costs instead of building new data centers. So theyâ\\x80\\x99re turning to cloud services to save money in the short term.   How has remote work changed the landscape?  Heath Terry: Itâ\\x80\\x99s been a major area of technological development over the last year as companies scrambled to go from a world where a handful of their employees were working remotely to a world where nearly all of them are. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s lead to the acceleration of videoconferencing applications, but also the development of new tools as necessity forced invention.  Youâ\\x80\\x99ve also seen companies that were slower to move out of on premise data centers accelerate their move to cloud infrastructure or cloud hosted applications because they lost access to their physical infrastructure or tools. Interestingly, weâ\\x80\\x99re now starting to seeing the second order effect as companied change their real estate, recruiting, and compensation strategies to reflect this new reality, so weâ\\x80\\x99re only beginning to fully understand the changes to the landscape.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 10 December 2020  On the heels of the firmâ\\x80\\x99s annual conference, we caught up with Richard Ramsden, who leads the Financials Group within Goldman Sachs Research. Below, he discusses takeaways from his conversations with company management teams, including the outlook for capital returns and strategic investment.  What was the tone from participating companies regarding the recovery?  Richard Ramsden: It was generally positive among banks, asset managers and independent advisors, thanks to the monetary and fiscal intervention and the prospect of a vaccine on the horizon. By and large, the companies we spoke to viewed the outlook as improving, and we didnâ\\x80\\x99t hear significant concerns about liquidity, credit, or the prospects for growth. That said, corporate confidence isnâ\\x80\\x99t as strong as sentiment in the markets suggests, particularly among smaller firms. We heard some managements suggest further fiscal stimulus is needed to tide these small businesses and consumers over until a vaccine becomes widely available next year.  What does an improving outlook mean for capital returns? Do you expect to see those ramp up, and in what formâ\\x80\\x94buybacks or dividends?  Richard Ramsden:  Yesâ\\x80\\x94weâ\\x80\\x99re expecting capital returns to reaccelerate with the recovery, but this needs to be preceded by the Fed ending the buyback moratorium and dividend cap it imposed last summer. The fundamentals also look supportive of a reacceleration, once that happens: many of the large banks we spoke to at the conference reported capital well above their required buffers and a comfort with their dividend payoutâ\\x80\\x94if not a desire to go higher. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also worth mentioning a third outlet for excess capital that really grew in focus given the buyback and dividend restriction, as well as the more muted growth outlook, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s M&A. Weâ\\x80\\x99re still seeing interest here as a means for companies to deploy some of their excess capital, and in a way that supports their strategic growth priorities.  Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a good segue into areas of investment. What are Financials investing more or less in as a result of the pandemic? How have their priorities shifted?  Richard Ramsden: The pandemic hasnâ\\x80\\x99t changed strategic priorities so much as it has accelerated investment in trends that existed before the coronavirus hit. Most notably, the wave of digitization weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen over the last few years has accelerated, especially in technologies like digital banking and cashless payments where there are non-financial players in the ring. So it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t surprising that we heard a recurring focus from Financials on technology investment that can drive a wider competitive gap in the space. This should allow these companies to accelerate the rationalization of historical distribution channels, as most believe these trends will outlive the pandemic. And thatâ\\x80\\x99s a conclusion weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen supported by other industries â\\x80\\x93 once consumer behavior changes, it rarely changes back.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 03 December 2020   The hedge fund industry is poised to post one of its strongest years since the global financial crisis, according to Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Tony Pasquariello, global head of hedge fund coverage for the Global Markets Division, who explained the drivers behind the performance and the outlook for 2021.   Tony, can you describe how the hedge fund industry has performed this year?  Tony Pasquariello: The hedge fund community has, on net, had a very strong year, a renaissance of sortsâ\\x80\\x94arguably, itâ\\x80\\x99s been the best year for many funds in at least a decade. Despite a relatively lean opportunity set from 2016 to 2018 -- when market volatility was exceptionally low -- returns this year have been comparatively very strong. A number of strategies have performed well, including the directional macro funds, who were well positioned on the long side of fixed income in the first quarter, then pivoted to a pro-risk stance in equities and credit once markets started to rally into the spring and summer. Other cohorts that have performed well include multi-strategy, platform-like funds and many of the traditional fundamental long-short funds, especially those most levered to growth stocks.   How are hedge fund investors positioned going into the end of the year?   Tony Pasquariello: Hedge funds have taken on a pro-risk stance, particularly as the year has progressed. According to Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 prime brokerage data, portfolio net and gross exposures are both elevated on a historical basis, with a tilt toward US large cap tech stocks, health care and media stocks. On the back of positive vaccine developments, we have also seen managers moving more chips into the cyclical or value buckets by adding US industrials, basic materials and consumer discretionary stocks.   What are likely to be the key strategies in focus for hedge funds in 2021?   Tony Pasquariello: At a high level, thereâ\\x80\\x99s an expectation that 2021 will be another good year for the industry against a positive macro backdrop which, according to our Goldman Sachs Research colleagues, includes an above consensus view of around 6% global GDP growth, another 20% rally in the S&P 500 and the start of structural bull market in commodities. That said, a lot of money has already been made in fixed income this year and with central banks committed to anchoring rates at the zero bound, itâ\\x80\\x99s going to be very difficult to replicate those returns in fixed income going forward. So we expect investors to turn to non-traditional strategies and managers to find returns outside of fixed income, specifically in equities, currencies, commodities. One could also expect that hedge funds will continue to add more private assets to their portfolios over coming years.  Finally, interest in ESG has continued, and even accelerated, during the pandemic and weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing the theme play a larger role in the asset management landscape, including hedge funds.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 25 November 2020   With one or more COVID-19 vaccines on the horizon, investors are looking ahead to the manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine. During a recent daily Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) Forum event, Dr. John Grabenstein, president of consulting service Vaccine Dynamics SP and former Global Executive Director of Medical Affairs for Merck Vaccines, discussed the logistics of a vaccine rollout with Gurpreet Gill, a macro strategist within GSAMâ\\x80\\x99s Fixed Income team.   Gurpreet Gill: Dr. Grabenstein, can you start by sharing your thoughts on the recent vaccine efficacy results and what they mean for COVID-19 vaccine discovery?   Dr. John Grabenstein: While I would caution that the efficacy findings are still interim results, they are certainly good news as they suggest we have correctly identified the spike protein as the Achillesâ\\x80\\x99 heel of the virusâ\\x80\\x94and that bodes well across all vaccine technologies. It is rare to observe adverse events beyond 42 days after vaccination and so the coming months will provide more clarity on vaccine safety. We only need one successful vaccineâ\\x80\\x94though more than one is helpfulâ\\x80\\x94but what will be crucial is obtaining sufficient doses to be able to cover the global population of more than 7.8 billion people, especially given that some of the vaccine candidates require two doses.   Gurpreet Gill: Will pharmaceutical companies and governments achieve the manufacturing and distribution undertaking ahead of them?   Dr. John Grabenstein: This is uncharted territoryâ\\x80\\x94we have never tried to vaccinate the whole world at once before. Smallpox is the closest historical parallel but that was a 10-year sustained effort. That said, there are modern-day precedents for mass vaccinations. In the US, for example, we administer 160 million to 180 million doses of influenza vaccine in a span of three to four months, year after year. With COVID-19, vaccine developers have been working on development, manufacturing and logistics concurrently so they can move quickly if their vaccines get the regulatory green light. As part of that process, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been focused on identifying potential bottlenecks.  Gurpreet Gill: What are some of the potential challenges and bottlenecks?   Dr. John Grabenstein: There is an unprecedented requirement for cooperation, coordination, synchronization and integration to deliver the vaccine to every city, town or village. Consider this: There is no master database bringing together every healthcare provider, medical equipment warehouse, vaccine storage place and transit node. That said, there are efforts underway to solve the logistical challenges. In the US, for example, the Department of Defense is helping the Centers for Disease Control allocate and distribute COVID-19 vaccines by leveraging the DODâ\\x80\\x99s military planning and logistics technology to integrate various data into one platform.  Another challenge is that vaccines have to be distributed under controlled conditions, with some requiring ultra-cold temperatures. It is doable but it requires meticulous planning and monitoring. For example, dry iceâ\\x80\\x94which is required to maintain the cold chain during transport of some vaccinesâ\\x80\\x94can become CO2 gas in airfreight unless stored appropriately. That said, these issues are controllable and vaccines can be transported this way if airlines are able to monitor this precious cargo with suitable equipment while in flight.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s worth noting that Merckâ\\x80\\x99s Ebola vaccine faced similar challenges as it had to be stored at -80 degrees Celsius. That vaccine was transported using Arktek containersâ\\x80\\x94a high-tech insulated cylinder that can maintain cold temperatures for up to a week at a time without an external power sourceâ\\x80\\x94during the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in Western Africa and more recently during outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As a result of this technology, that Ebola vaccine could be distributed to austere rural regions during armed conflict. While the scale and reach of that vaccination program was not as broad as what will be required for a COVID-19 vaccine, its success creates room for optimism.  Gurpreet Gill: Will the location of vaccine manufacturing influence vaccine distribution?   Dr. John Grabenstein: In order to produce billions of doses, vaccine developers have partnered with manufacturers around the world. There are manufacturing plants in the US, Europe and the UK, but also across developing countries including Brazil, Russia and India. Many advanced countries have secured supply commitments that do not depend on manufacturing location. For developing countries, the COVAX facilityâ\\x80\\x94a global procurement mechanismâ\\x80\\x94seeks to ensure equitable vaccine distribution.   Gurpreet Gill: Finally, Dr. Grabenstein, when do you think a vaccine will be widely available and how willing do you think the broader public will be to receive it?   Dr. John Grabenstein: Once vaccine developers apply for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for vaccination of at-risk individuals and essential workersâ\\x80\\x94which weâ\\x80\\x99ll likely see in November or Decemberâ\\x80\\x94the US FDA will require perhaps 2 or 3 weeks to review the application before it goes to the CDC for implementation. The European Union has a pathway similar to EUA called Conditional Marketing Authorisation. Given this is new territory, there is currently some debate over which U.S. population groups would be prioritized in an EUA approval. At the earliest, I would expect first vaccinations for identified at-risk groups in the US from mid-December. Assuming a significant supply of vaccines is available by late spring or early summer of next year, a large portion of the US population could be vaccinated by the end of 2021. A similar timeline seems plausible for other major economies such as the Euro area and the UK. But of course, a final and critical step in this progress is vaccine uptake which will depend on vaccine safety and efficacyâ\\x80\\x94data on which is still incomingâ\\x80\\x94as well as trust in the licensure process.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 29 October 2020   As the chief investment officer for the San Francisco Employeesâ\\x80\\x99 Retirement System (SFERS), Bill Coaker Jr. has achieved risk-adjusted returns in the top one percent of SFERSâ\\x80\\x99 peer group. At a recent Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) Forum discussion, Coaker, who has more than 25 years of investment experience, spoke with portfolio managers on GSAMâ\\x80\\x99s Fundamental Equity business, including Katie Koch, Brook Dane, Jenny Chang, Alexis Deladerrière and Laura Destribats.  Katie Koch: Bill, before we dive into your investment views and outlook for returns, Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to share how we, at GSAM, have been thinking about asset allocation. Our view is that the traditional balanced portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds is broken and is insufficient as a way for institutional and individual investors to generate the returns they will need in the coming years. In fact, while a 60/40 portfolio generated annualized real returns of 8% over the past decade, we believe it will only generate 2% to 3% real annual returns over the next decade. The reason, we believe, boils down to the fact that equities are expensive today and the risks from the bond market are asymmetric. And with more than half of the US market invested in the equity benchmarksâ\\x80\\x94which, by their nature, are backward lookingâ\\x80\\x94we believe investors are largely underweight innovation and the trends that will drive the world in the future. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s your take?  Bill Coaker: My view is that a low return index approach in both stocks and bonds is already underway, with a 60% equities/40% bonds portfolio likely to result in returns in the mid-4%. Against this backdrop, the speed of innovation is accelerating rapidly and investors are underestimating its speed, scale and impact. Another way to measure the speed of innovation is by looking at the average age of the companies. Just 15 years ago, the weighted average age of the eight largest companies by market cap was 100 years old. Today, the average age of the eight largest companies is only 22 years old. In 2012, eight years after its founding, Facebook reached one billion users. Just eight years later, TikTok reached one billion users in less than three years, or three times faster than Facebook achieved less than a decade ago. In sum, the speed of innovation and its adoption is rapidly accelerating. Finally, itâ\\x80\\x99s worth noting that the variability of returns has increased, which provides significant opportunities for active management. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a great time for alpha.  Brook Dane: Not only is a great time for alpha, but we also believe weâ\\x80\\x99re on the cusp of an incredible wave of innovation. For one, the public cloud is enabling companies to efficiently innovate and adapt on shared infrastructure. At the same time, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing the rise of intelligent computing at the edge of the networkâ\\x80\\x94meaning that as billions of people with smartphones move into 5G, weâ\\x80\\x99ll see the generation of data that will drive insight into artificial intelligence or machine learning. Weâ\\x80\\x99re already seeing the next wave of platform companies start to emerge. For our part, weâ\\x80\\x99re invested in companies across the software ecosystem, the payments infrastructure and the semiconductor sector.   Alexis Deladerrière: Similarly, we also believe weâ\\x80\\x99re on the cusp of a sustainability revolution, which could have the scale of the Industrial Revolution with the speed of the digital revolution. We believe the providers of green technologies represent attractive investment opportunities over the next decade. And itâ\\x80\\x99s not just going to be one sector or one technology that will solve the climate crisisâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s going to be a range of solutions encompassing renewables, electric vehicles, smart buildings, sustainable food or hydrogen technologies.  Katie Koch: When you look across the world, which end markets do you think are most misunderstood?  Bill Coaker: In my view, the human experience is fast evolving from the industrial age to an era of science, technology and innovation. The impact of that transition will be far greater than the human transition from the agricultural era to the industrial age and weâ\\x80\\x99re still in the early stages of that transition. So far, this revolution has only improved calculations, convenience, communications and disrupted retail. The next wave of innovation will affect larger segments of the human experience such as transportation, energy, education, finance, and health careâ\\x80\\x94all of which we expect will improve and rapidly evolve over the next 20 years.  Jenny Chang: We agree that health care is rapidly evolving, especially at the intersection of technology and health care. You can see that in the rise of telemedicine and remote patient monitoring, or in the ways that connected devices are being used to transform diabetes care. And because the cost of gene sequencing has come down sharply, we have a much better understanding of the human genome today and weâ\\x80\\x99ve only just scratched the surface. As our understanding of diseases continues to deepen, we will continue to see the launch of next-generation medicines and gene therapies. As investors, weâ\\x80\\x99re accessing that innovation by investing in gene sequencing, gene therapy and across the genomic supply chain.   Laura Destribats: Itâ\\x80\\x99s also important to look at the extent to which the pandemic has accelerated behavioral changes. One of our investment views is that many of the digital behaviors associated with the millennialsâ\\x80\\x94such as shopping online and social mediaâ\\x80\\x94have been adopted by the broader population and are likely to be permanent simply because itâ\\x80\\x99s more convenient. But millennialsâ\\x80\\x99 preference for experiences is likely to revert back to pre-pandemic levels once things normalize given pent up demand. In China, where the virus has largely been brought under control, travel bookings by people under 30 are already back to pre-pandemic levels.  Katie Koch: So Bill, as investors look to tap innovation and the future leaders, what are your thoughts on the best way to access that growthâ\\x80\\x94is it through public or private markets?   Bill Coaker: Both public and private equities provide significant excess returns. While private markets have posted very good returns, investors can also post similar high returns in public markets. Consider the fact that when Amazon went public 23 years ago, it had a valuation of $450 million. Today, it is worth $1.5 trillion, resulting in a total return of 3,300x. By comparison, strong returns from a venture capital fund is typically about five times. There are plenty of other examples such as Netflix, Salesforce, Nvidia and numerous software and technology companies that are publicly traded and have posted very high returns. So it is worthwhile to pursue innovation in the public markets which can post excess returns comparable to that of private markets. In fact, if you look at Yaleâ\\x80\\x99s endowment, public equities have been the source of the highest excess returns over the last 20 years.  Katie Koch: Finally, Bill, how are you capturing these themes in your portfolios?  Bill Coaker: While there are different inputs that go into an asset allocation decision, we would allocate about 40% to public equity and about 25% to private equity for a normalized institutional portfolio requiring 2% to 2.5% net cash outflows. To post high returns, the vast majority of that 65% allocation to public and private equity should be invested in leaders in innovation. Some of the public equity allocation will need to be passively invested for the purposes of providing capital calls to private equity as well as pay benefits for a pension plan or student tuition, capital projects, and operating expenses for a university. We would place the remaining 35% in actively managed strategies, depending on an investorâ\\x80\\x99s desire to pursue additional return or preserve capital and reduce volatility.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 15 October 2020   A low-for-longer interest rate environment can be particularly difficult for insurance companies, which need higher-yielding investments to match their underwritten liabilities. So how are Japanese insurers adjusting to a prolonged period of negative interest rates? We sat down with Yusuke Ochi, who works with insurers and other institutional clients in Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Global Markets Division in Japan, to discuss.  To set the stage, can you give us some context about the life insurance industry in Japan?  Yusuke Ochi: The Japanese life insurance market is the third largest in the world after the US and China, with nearly 90% of Japanese households holding life insurance policies, in contrast to 70% in the US and 38% in the UK. The industry itself is a lynchpin of the economy, serving both as a repository for a substantial amount of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s savings and acting as a key institutional investor in the countryâ\\x80\\x99s domestic and international equity landscape.  In recent years, the operating environment for life insurance companies has become increasingly challenging. For one, the industry is overshadowed by Japanâ\\x80\\x99s aging demographics and stubbornly low birth rate. Fewer people means fewer policy holders. In fact, the volume of in-force policies has dropped rapidly since peaking in 1996.  But a more immediate issue for the industry is the impact of the negative interest rate policy introduced in Japan in 2016. Not only has this hurt insurersâ\\x80\\x99 profitability in the short term, it has also forced them to change their investment strategies in ways thatâ\\x80\\x94if left uncheckedâ\\x80\\x94could store up potential risks in the future due to upcoming regulatory changes.  What are these risks?  Yusuke Ochi: Negative interest rates have been a real body blow to Japanese life insurersâ\\x80\\x99 traditional business model, which centers on charging customers premiums in exchange for insurance coverage, then reinvesting those premiums in other interest-generating assets. In the past, Japanese government bonds (JGBs) were the investment vehicle of choice due to their stable returns and their essentially zero risk weighting from a regulatory perspective, which means insurers donâ\\x80\\x99t need to hold any capital against them. However, JGB yields had been falling for decades before the Bank of Japan finally pushed them into negative territory in a bid to boost bank lending to stimulate the economy after the financial crisis.  The impact of this is two-fold. Firstly, negative interest rates have hit profitability. While only the yields on shorter-tenor JGBs have actually fallen below zero, the Bank of Japanâ\\x80\\x99s policy has effectively pushed down yields across the curve, squeezing the returns that life insurers can make. This has also led to a significant decrease in policy sales as ultra-low yields make life insurance products less attractive to consumers. Secondly, these firms now find themselves struggling with what is known as a duration gapâ\\x80\\x94or the risk that stems from a gap between interest rates on assets and liabilities. When they sell policies, life insurance companies take on long-dated liabilities which, by their nature, expose them to long-dated interest rate market fluctuations. JGB purchases should act as hedge to this riskâ\\x80\\x94but in the past, insurers left some liabilities unhedged as few predicted the BOJâ\\x80\\x99s policy change.  So what steps have insurers taken to mitigate these risks?   Yusuke Ochi: Insurers have largely turned to higher yielding foreign securitiesâ\\x80\\x94bonds in particularâ\\x80\\x94in recent years, with total holdings now reaching 95 trillion yen, marking an approximate 40% increase over the past five years. While offering potentially higher returns, such investments also expose Japanese companies to an added layer of market risk due to fluctuations in currency and interest rate movements. Compounding matters is the fact that regulatory changes set to take effect in 2025 will raise the capital requirements for Japanese insurers with longer liability durations that are unhedged.   That sounds like Japanese life insurers have been taking on more risk with their investmentsâ\\x80\\x94whatâ\\x80\\x99s your take?   Yusuke Ochi: The priority for these financial institutions is to mitigate, or hedge, against fluctuations in interest rate and forex risks in order to reduce the capital requirements. As a result, weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen more insurers turn to derivatives as a way to hedge interest rate risk in their asset-liability management book and currency movements on their foreign asset holdings. While some insurers are still relatively new to these instruments, the industry overall is getting more comfortable with using derivatives-based solutionsâ\\x80\\x94from vanilla interest rate swaps to more complex structured productsâ\\x80\\x94to optimize their asset-liability balance.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 30 September 2020   After a challenging second quarter, M&A volumes have picked up in the second half of the year, marking a near return to pre-COVID activity levels. We sat down with Investment Banking Divisionâ\\x80\\x99s Colin Ryan, co-head of M&A for the Americas and global co-head of Technology M&A, and David Dubner, global head of M&A structuring, about the factors driving activity.  Mergers and acquisitions activity appears to have surged in recent months. What are you seeing today?   Colin Ryan: After a significant slowdown in April and May, we have seen a significant acceleration in new deal activity over the summer. In fact, July not only represented the strongest month of 2020 but also exceeded average monthly volumes experienced over the prior five-year M&A bull market. On the back of a strong equity market rebound and supportive financing markets, recent strategic dialogue and execution activity are beginning to translate into announced volumes. So far, the fall is off to a strong start. In fact, weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a significant uptick in announced M&A deals over the past few weeks. Announced M&A volumes have broken through the $1 trillion level for the September quarter which represents a significant rebound back to pre-COVID levels.    How would you characterize the M&A activity in the market?   Colin Ryan: The M&A activity weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing is broad-based across sectors. All segments of the market across deal sizes, geographies, buyer types and industries are participating in this recent recovery. Big deals are also back, as evidenced by Nvidiaâ\\x80\\x99s $40 billion acquisition of ARM and Illuminaâ\\x80\\x99s $8 billion acquisition of Grail, while the depth of the market can be seen by the rebound in number of deals. Most importantly, leading metrics, such as new solicitations and conflict checks, indicate that this trend will continue into the second half of the year. Corporate carve-outs and a general move toward portfolio rationalization are in focus, as well as partial sales where sellers retain some ownership in order to participate in future upside as markets and economies improve.  As we move into the second half, all eyes are on the upcoming US presidential election. How is that affecting corporate M&A activity?  David Dubner: With the upcoming elections, many of the companies we speak with are assessing the potential for US tax reform and tax rate increasesâ\\x80\\x94which, we believe, is a tailwind for M&A activity in the current environment. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s because former Vice President Bidenâ\\x80\\x99s campaign has proposed a tax plan that would increase corporate and individual rates, which may be implemented in some form if Democrats win the presidency and win a majority in both the House and Senate in the November election. From a corporate perspective, higher tax rates would lead to lower after-tax cash flows, whichâ\\x80\\x94all else being equalâ\\x80\\x94would reduce a US buyerâ\\x80\\x99s ability to pay and reduce a US sellerâ\\x80\\x99s valuation. As a consequence, M&A dialogue continues at a frenetic pace as more companies attempt to position themselves across a host of possible regulatory, economic and pandemic-related outcomes.           So how are the elections impacting strategic activity?  David Dubner: Broadly speaking, an increase in the US corporate tax rate may make tax-efficient structural alternatives, such as spinoffs and joint ventures, more attractive. In addition, Bidenâ\\x80\\x99s proposal also includes a Global Intangible Low-Tax Income tax rate which would essentially double the tax rate that US companies pay on non-US earnings. If enacted, that creates an incentive for companies with a geographic footprint outside of the US to bring operations back to the USâ\\x80\\x94a move that some companies are already evaluating as they seek to gain greater control over their supply chains amid the pandemic. From a sell-side perspective, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing companies and financial sponsors consider accelerating capital gains and carried interests through sales of non-core businesses, while other value investors are looking across the public and private markets for assets to invest in. Many large corporates are also reevaluating their cross-holdings, or investments in other companies, and are seeking to monetize those investments.  What types of investors have been the most active in M&A?  Colin Ryan: Strategics have been at the forefront of market activity but we have also seen private equity engage in more creative deals such as PIPEs (private investments in public equity) and other partial control deals. One of the most innovative segments of the market has been the flurry of SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) M&A transactions, with over $83 billion of volume this year. The upcoming election and the potential impact on longer term tax rates is a keen focus for both corporate and private owners of assets and we expect to see an active sell-side market over the next several months.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 23 September 2020  As the CIO and Executive Director for the Minnesota State Board of Investment (MSBI), Mansco Perry oversees approximately $100 billion in assets. At a recent Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) Forum discussion, Perry spoke with GSAMâ\\x80\\x99s Katie Koch, co-head of GSAMâ\\x80\\x99s Fundamental Equity business, and Mike Swell, head of Global Portfolio Management within the Global Fixed Income team, on his core investment philosophies and processes, asset class preferences, and the role of diversity.   Katie Koch: Mansco, prior to becoming CIO of MSBI in 2013, you were CIO at Macalester College and at the Maryland State Retirement and Pension system. How has your investment philosophy and approach evolved over time and how are you implementing it at MSBI?   Mansco Perry: Historically, weâ\\x80\\x99ve had a pretty small team at MSBI and my predecessor, Howard Bicker, kept things simple. So if you look back over the last 40 years, our pension portfolios havenâ\\x80\\x99t changed very much. The majority of our portfolio is still in public equitiesâ\\x80\\x94in international and domestic equitiesâ\\x80\\x94and in fixed income. But over time, our allocation to the private markets has increased. When I first joined MSBI in 1990, we had a target allocation to the private markets of 10%, which we gradually raised to 15%, then to 20% and now weâ\\x80\\x99re at 25%. Currently, our actual allocation in the private markets is more around 15%. My personal philosophy is that there are basically two things an investor can do: Own good assets or lend money to good borrowers to ensure youâ\\x80\\x99re receiving a reasonable return.   Mike Swell: Having invested through multiple economic cycles, how did your philosophy help you navigate whatâ\\x80\\x99s been one of the biggest dislocations in markets this year that weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen in recent history?   Mansco Perry: Fortunately, my first CIO job was at the Maryland pension system in 2008 where I quickly appreciated the need for liquidity during the global financial crisis. You figure out pretty quickly that your job isnâ\\x80\\x99t to make the most money in portfolios, but to ensure that you can meet your liabilities to make pension plan paymentsâ\\x80\\x94and I gained a greater appreciation for Treasuries during that time period. Since Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been back in Minnesota, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been pushing the need to increase our allocation to Treasuries which we did a few years ago and which has turned out to be our best-performing asset in the last two years.  Mike Swell: Speaking of liquidity, you had mentioned earlier that your target for private assets is about 25% and that youâ\\x80\\x99re currently at a 15% allocation. What are your views on private markets as an asset class?   Mansco Perry: Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been in the private marketsâ\\x80\\x94and predominantly private equityâ\\x80\\x94since 1981. Historically, PE has been our best-returning asset class. And while we recognize thereâ\\x80\\x99s a so-called lack of liquidity, I believe you do get fair values in the private markets over the long term. When I look at the roller coaster ride that equities have been on this past spring, itâ\\x80\\x99s hard for me to believe those values truly represent a steady stream of those companiesâ\\x80\\x99 future cash flows. Of our allocation to private markets, about 50% to 60% is typically in private equity, where I believe thereâ\\x80\\x99s a strong principal-agency connection. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve also invested a fair amount in private credit, mostly mezzanine loans, and have recently been investing in direct lending. And while we donâ\\x80\\x99t invest in hedge funds, we have been looking at some opportunistic and distressed assets. Our real estate allocationâ\\x80\\x94which was large in the 1980s and 1990sâ\\x80\\x94had declined to less than 1% of our portfolio shortly before I re-joined MSBI, but weâ\\x80\\x99re reevaluating that sector on both the debt and equity side.   Katie Koch: One of the ways that weâ\\x80\\x99re long-term oriented in our public equity investments is that weâ\\x80\\x99ve integrated ESG into our investment processes to help identify risks and opportunities. Our philosophy is that itâ\\x80\\x99s not just an issue of equitability but itâ\\x80\\x99s also one of profitability. In fact, weâ\\x80\\x99ve aligned our proxy voting process in that way to get more corporate boards to get more diversity on their boards. How do you think about ESG in your investment philosophies?  Mansco Perry: Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come to believe that ESG, more than anything, is a philosophy rather than a product we would buy. For my part, I believe that plan sponsors should be pushing, promoting and prodding all of their managers to pay attention to ESG, regardless of the asset class. We recently signed a petition opposing the Department of Laborâ\\x80\\x99s recent rule which could discourage retirement funds from making investments based on ESG considerations. Weâ\\x80\\x99re also pulling out of any thermal coal investments. On social issues, we have been pushing our proxy committees to expand the number of women and people of color on their boards. Given my background and personal history, I believe itâ\\x80\\x99s something thatâ\\x80\\x99s pretty important. I grew up Newark, New Jersey and back in 1967, a similar situation to George Floydâ\\x80\\x99s murder took place. A number of moves and efforts were enacted back then. But people soon forget and here we are, 50 years later and going through the same reawakening. I do think the investment industry can play a larger part, but unless thereâ\\x80\\x99s a concerted effort, Iâ\\x80\\x99m very concerned about the future.   Katie Koch: When you think about the world from a macro perspective, how much of a threat is income inequality in the current environment?  Mansco Perry: I think itâ\\x80\\x99s a big threat. I started thinking more about these issues when we had the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011. Personally, I think thereâ\\x80\\x99s enough wealth and innovation in this country to make our economy much larger. Outside of urban America, if we put the type of effort that we put into developing say, emerging markets, into areas such as the Appalachians, the Mississippi Delta and many of the areas in the Rust Belt economies, we could expand the economic pie and create a more vital economy. Iâ\\x80\\x99m convinced that through innovation and advances in technology we could educate everyone. And if we could do that, we could eradicate poverty and truly give an everyone an opportunity to participate in the economy.   Mike Swell: Can you talk about how you look at the funded status as a public plan versus a corporate plan, and how itâ\\x80\\x99s impacted your asset allocation?  Mansco Perry: Fortunately, we are a public plan not a corporate plan, so we havenâ\\x80\\x99t had to be very liability driven.  Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been fortunate that our funded status in aggregate across the pension plans and retirement systems that we manage have been in the high 70s, low 80s and in one of the plan I manage in the low 90s. Still, we recognize that whatever we do, weâ\\x80\\x99re going to have be equities-centric in our public and private investments. We have to make the returns. Fortunately, weâ\\x80\\x99re able to take a long-term investment horizon.  We did just raise our fixed income allocation to 25% and will likely have between 12% to 15% in Treasuries going forward. Our concern there, however, is that weâ\\x80\\x99ve had a pretty good run with rates going downâ\\x80\\x94and I have some concern about rates going negative. So weâ\\x80\\x99re looking at our long-dated Treasuries now and thinking we need to set some triggers where we might have some discussions to lower the duration of our portfolios. At some point, with all the money being printed, if markets were to behave as they should, rates should go upâ\\x80\\x94and I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I want to be there at that point in time.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 16 September 2020  In recent years, investors have broadened their search for potential returns by taking on non-traditional or â\\x80\\x9calternativeâ\\x80\\x9d risks. Many of these alternative risk premia (ARP) have historically been implemented by hedge funds and other institutional investors that develop long-short strategies aimed at mitigating market volatility. We sat down with Goldman Sachs Asset Managementâ\\x80\\x99s Federico Gilly and Matthew Schwab to discuss the latest developments in this space.  First of all, can you explain ARP strategies and why theyâ\\x80\\x99re gaining traction among investors?   Federico Gilly: To understand ARP, itâ\\x80\\x99s helpful to compare them to the now more-familiar â\\x80\\x9csmart betaâ\\x80\\x9d strategies. With smart beta strategies, the basic aim is to outperform a traditional market-cap weighted stock index by selectively choosing and re-weighting stocks in the index according to one or more common investment themes. The academic research behind smart betaâ\\x80\\x94a classification of investment strategy which have gained popularity over the last 20 yearsâ\\x80\\x94suggests that certain traits or â\\x80\\x9cfactorsâ\\x80\\x9d such as low volatility, value or momentum can outperform traditional market-cap weighted indexes.  ARP are developed from a similar vein of research by isolating common investment themes among alternative managers. However, these strategies go a step further by identifying potential returns across asset classes â\\x80\\x94such as equities, fixed income, currencies and commoditiesâ\\x80\\x94and systematically applying the concept of factor investing to long-short portfolios, thus creating a new asset class of alternative investment capabilities. As a result, ARP strategies have attracted some $200 billion in assets over the last decade.  What are the benefits of ARP to investors?   Matthew Schwab: For many investors, the biggest risk in their portfolios is equity risk. Therefore, they are constantly looking to diversify this risk, as well as find additional potential sources of return, in order to reduce portfolio volatility.  ARP strategies aim to deliver returns which are independent of the equity or bond markets to provide investors with another source of portfolio diversification. For example, an ARP strategy designed to capture the well-known low volatility premium (that less risky stocks tend to outperform riskier ones) would invest in low volatility stocks and hedge the overall market risk by taking short positions in either the overall market or in high volatility stocks.  This removes the â\\x80\\x9cbetaâ\\x80\\x9d of the market itself so that investors are only exposed to the â\\x80\\x9cpureâ\\x80\\x9d returns of low volatility stocks outperforming high volatility stocks. In addition, ARP strategies are designed to be more transparent, lower cost and more liquid than many traditional alternative investments, further enhancing their attractiveness in a diversified portfolio.   Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Bloomberg just announced the Bloomberg GSAM Risk Premia Indices, the first transparent, investible index family for ARP strategies. What was the rationale for the move?   Federico Gilly: The idea for the benchmark actually came from investors who have expressed frustration at the lack of a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of ARP products. Alternative risk premia indices in the marketplace today typically aggregate the returns of individual ARP managers or indices and, as a result, are more of a peer group than a true benchmark. These indices lack the level of transparency typically desirable in a benchmark to help investors more precisely understand the risk and return of the asset class. Unlike traditional equities, which went from indexing to smart beta, ARP jumped from idea to execution without the development of an index or benchmark. As a result, investors have struggled to properly benchmark ARP managers on their performance and analyze their strategies. Compounding matters is the fact that there is a great deal of variation in how ARP managers implement their strategies, resulting in wide dispersion of returns. We partnered with Bloomberg in an effort to design a suite of indices that could help address these challenges by providing a benchmark* based on consensus definitions against which manager performance can be measured. By being transparent and replicable, these indices can be used both to understand performance as well as to provide low-cost beta to the asset class.  *The indices are administered by Bloomberg's authorized index administrator, Bloomberg Index Services Limited (BISL). BISL is responsible for calculation, governance and licensing of these indices.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 19 August 2020  The pandemic is accelerating underlying trends in the real estate market, such as a decline in office space in major cities like New York and a move to the suburbs, according to Jamie LeFrak, Vice Chairman of LeFrak, a multi-generational real estate investment firm with one of the largest privately held portfolios in the US. Speaking at a recent Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) Forum event, LeFrak shared his thoughts on real estate in a post-COVID landscape with GSAM portfolio manager Nora Creedon.  Nora Creedon: One of the big surprises from the pandemic has been the desire for people to continue to work from homeâ\\x80\\x94and employersâ\\x80\\x99 willingness to allow it given high productivity levels. As a result, the shutdown has created a work-from-home revolution which has big implications for the future of work. What are your thoughts on how remote working might affect the office business?  Jamie LeFrak: While many are predicting the â\\x80\\x9cdeath\" of office space, I donâ\\x80\\x99t see this as a forever secular change. Once the pandemic is under control, people will want to be near each other again, and those face-to-face interactions will be important, especially in certain sectors such as finance. Weâ\\x80\\x99re all going to need to interact more efficiently and frequently. New York City, however, as a place to do those things is in trouble and will continue to be.  Nora Creedon: Can you expand on that? Given the fact that you have major portfolio holdings in New York and New Jersey, what is your assessment for commercial office space in New York?  Jamie LeFrak: In New York City, the need for commercial office space has been steadily declining since 2007 and the operating side of the office businessâ\\x80\\x94faced with ongoing margin erosion amid higher real estate taxes and higher costs of tenant acquisitionsâ\\x80\\x94has been especially difficult. The pandemic has only accelerated the number of people leaving big cities which has, in effect, made it easier for employers to move their workers to lower-cost cities.  Nora Creedon: But what about the requirements to maintain social distancing? Is it possible that companies will want to invest in more office space as a result?  Jamie LeFrak: I donâ\\x80\\x99t expect that companies will be making significant capital investments to reconfigure their offices. Just a year ago, for example, we were talking how the Green New Deal obligations in New York office buildings would require the air to circulate in a way it didnâ\\x80\\x99t before. But to date, we havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen the large-scale investments materialize. My sense is that the discussions to de-densify office space is a fad, like the styles of office that come and go.  Nora Creedon: So in a market like New York, if office demand slowly erodes, one of the obvious impacts will be on the residential market. What do you think will happen there?  Jamie LeFrak: The problem with New York is that the population has been in decline and COVID has only accelerated that trend. New York City had been losing about 30,000 people each year over the previous two years. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a trend that we havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen since 1970s, when the city lost about 800,000 people, creating dire consequences. Weâ\\x80\\x99re undergoing the same circumstances today and weâ\\x80\\x99re likely to see higher real estate and city and state income taxes, as a result. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a larger trend whereby most states\\' fiscal resources are being directed to pension payments and the like, so thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lack of reinvestment in the municipalities which will continue to inhibit growth and depress interest rates.  New York City residential rents, for their part, are down about 15% on average since the start of COVID, with higher pre-existing rents experiencing a steeper drop. Meanwhile, landlords are having collection issues since tenants cannot be evicted, even when they can pay. While tenants in higher-end properties are continuing to make payments, tenants in â\\x80\\x9crougherâ\\x80\\x9d properties arenâ\\x80\\x99t as consistent because they canâ\\x80\\x99t be evicted any longer. So landlords are in this strange situation where they can have high-end properties where they\\'re collecting say, 97% of rent but the rents have dropped by about 30%. Or, they may have cheaper properties with rents of $1,500 a month that havenâ\\x80\\x99t changed, but are only collecting about 85% of those rents.  Nora Creedon: How are those trends affecting the residential sales?  Jamie LeFrak: We havenâ\\x80\\x99t yet found a floor for sales of residential properties. We expect, for example, sale prices to drop by about half in high-end properties from current levels. In fact, we havenâ\\x80\\x99t been bullish on New York since 2007 primarily because of the shrinking population. All real estate relies on people to use it. Many millennials, who are now in their 30s and 40s, have been fleeing the city for the suburbs, so COVID is accelerating trends that were already in place. Longer-term, many cities will stay resilient but there will be a demographic shift to an even younger population. In many ways, the virus has continued to exacerbate income inequalitiesâ\\x80\\x94those who can afford to leave, have already left the city.  Nora Creedon: So where are people going if theyâ\\x80\\x99re leaving from New York and where are you looking to invest in places outside of the tri-state area?  Jamie LeFrak: We started building major projects in south Florida in 2012 and in other sunshine states where thereâ\\x80\\x99s been strong population growth before COVID. As soon as the virus is under control, we believe those states will be among the first places people will go. Those statesâ\\x80\\x99 fiscal positions are also stronger, which invites the opportunity for growth. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve also been happy with our investments in Seattle, which has been very attractive for businesses and we continue to have substantial real estate holdings in Los Angeles.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 11 August 2020  Can technology be used to improve human performance? At the recent Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) Healthcare Investor Forum, Andrew Firlik, managing partner of JAZZ Venture Partners, spoke with GSAMâ\\x80\\x99s Hugh Lawson about emerging technologies that are helping to improve health and wellness outcomes.   Hugh Lawson: Andrew, given your background both as a neurosurgeon and a venture capitalist in the healthcare sector, can you share your perspective on why you believe technology can help improve brain function?  Andrew Firlik: What we understand through neuroscience is that brains have an abilityâ\\x80\\x94known as neuroplasticityâ\\x80\\x94to form new neural connections throughout our entire lives. Essentially, we can â\\x80\\x9crewireâ\\x80\\x9d our brains to adapt to new situations and conditions, or to compensate for a deficit. A child with attention deficit disorder, for example, struggles because of deficiencies in specific neurotransmitters. But therapeutic intervention can be used to strengthen that neural deficit in a way that is more beneficial than a pharmacological alternative.  Hugh Lawson: Artificial intelligence technology is seen by some as a threat to replacing human jobs. But AI can also be used as a force for good. Can you share your views on the therapeutic applications for AI in healthcare?  Andrew Firlik: Today, technology is mostly being used to improve workflow processes and to help make the business and infrastructure of healthcare more efficient. But AI and software technology is increasingly being leveraged to improve patient outcomes. One of our portfolio companies, for example, has developed a natural-language processing system that is designed to foster open-ended conversations. This technology is currently embedded in a robot that is being used to help children with autism spectrum disorder. Through seemingly playful interactions, the robot uses the same techniques that a human therapist would useâ\\x80\\x94such as measuring eye contact, emotions and encouraging back-and-forth conversationâ\\x80\\x94to improve a childâ\\x80\\x99s ability to connect socially. But instead of working one-on-one with a therapistâ\\x80\\x94often an expensive propositionâ\\x80\\x94families can use the robot to do things repeatedly, consistently and patiently, and in a more scalable manner.  Hugh Lawson: Can you talk about the venture capital environment that youâ\\x80\\x99re operating in, given that the industries you invest in cut across different disciplines?  Andrew Firlik: One of the reasons we decided to build a new venture capital firm in 2015 was to invest in emerging technologies that sit at the intersection of in AI and machine learning, and health, life sciences and wellness. In the traditional VC environment, thereâ\\x80\\x99s not a lot of cross-pollination between those areas. If youâ\\x80\\x99re an expert in AI and ML, youâ\\x80\\x99re often sitting in the so-called IT side of the house. If youâ\\x80\\x99ve been working in biotechnology, therapeutics or dealing with the FDA, you are typically sitting in life sciences or biotech. In our firm, we have data scientists, technologists, as well as media and entertainment experts who are working alongside people like me with a background in neuroscience and healthcare. In a typical VC model, each partner might be going out to win his or her own deals. We work together on every opportunity so we can see how the different dimensions come together to build breakthrough products.  Hugh Lawson: What has the investing environment been like since the lockdown started?  Andrew Firlik: We have been making investments throughout this period in part because our fund is benefiting from many of the tailwinds of the pandemic, such as telemedicine and digital therapeutics. Many of our investments are also focused on technologies that can help retrain a workforce and improve workforce productivity, or accelerate learning in a distributed learning environment. As investors, we have to take our cues from the world that weâ\\x80\\x99re living in and continue to back the entrepreneurs that are creating the solutions that we need. The arc of history reflects the constant battle between simply unleashing technologyâ\\x80\\x94with all its potencyâ\\x80\\x94on the world, and guiding technology in ways that help improve it.  Hugh Lawson: These days weâ\\x80\\x99re spending even more time on our devices and with technology. How do you expect that to change?  Andrew Firlik: The last 20 to 30 years of technological development were primarily focused on building transactional systemsâ\\x80\\x94sharing and moving data, or posting and commenting on social platforms, for example. But what happens to a generation of people who are constantly interacting with these systems? To be successful at software investing, I believe you have to link neuroscience and human psychology, especially as technology becomes more immersive through the use of AI and augmented reality. You need to look into every transactional system that youâ\\x80\\x99re building with an eye toward how it shapes us as people. And when you do that, you can see the incredible potential therapeutic or wellness potential that could come from that.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 04 August 2020  Insurance is typically considered to be one of the most traditional industries in financial services and, until recently, has proved to be fairly resistant to change. But changes in consumer behaviors, new technologies and emerging business models are disrupting the industry. We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Kelly Galanis, head of the Americas Financial Technology sector in the Investment Banking Division, about the emergence of insurance technology startups, known as insurtech, and its impact on the insurance industry.    Kelly, what are some of the ways that the insurance industry has changed in recent years?   Kelly Galanis: The insurance industry is an enormous market with approximately $5 trillion in premiums globally, where even the largest players represent only a few percentage points of the global premiums. While the insurance market has long been stable and steady, companies are embracing new technologies and new data sourcesâ\\x80\\x94think chatbots, telematics, drones, wearables and social mediaâ\\x80\\x94that enhance their capabilities to acquire customers and underwrite and administer policies. Second, changing consumer preferences and the rise of the direct-to-consumer model are creating a new class of full-stack insurance startups to provide a more efficient, transparent and mobile-friendly way of selling policies to customers at a lower prices and providing customers a better experienceâ\\x80\\x94a trend that is putting more pressure on the incumbents to embrace change.  According to recent survey data from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, about 60% of global insurance companies reportedly invest in or evaluate insurtech startups. How are you seeing that interest playing out with the companies you work with?  Kelly Galanis: Technology is helping the industry find better ways to deliver and price insuranceâ\\x80\\x94and insurtech startups are a way for the industry to invest in technology. In fact, in just the last year, the insurtech sector globally has attracted more than $7 billion in funding and investments from venture capital and other institutional investors. The incumbents, for their part, are investing anywhere from ~$100 million to $300 million into their own corporate VC funds that are dedicated to taking minority investments in insurtech startups with the goal of forging strategic and commercial partnerships. While some traditional insurers are acquiring startups and some are incubating their own direct-to-consumer start-ups, many more are partnering with them. As insurtechs continue to scale, we expect to see more activity in the space.  How do insurtech companies use data in a way thatâ\\x80\\x99s different than traditional insurers?  Kelly Galanis: This may be a simplistic way of looking at things but insurtech companies are able to utilize technology in more ways than traditional insurers. Insurtech companies donâ\\x80\\x99t just collect data, they integrate and connect the millions of data points they collect with the acquisition, underwriting and administration of the policies they write. This enables them to focus on increased personalization and greater accuracy and speed of service. Many use artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology to analyze the data they collect and offer deeper insights on an individualized basis. Insurtech companies have developed ways to leverage data from every interaction they have with a customer to improve upon the way traditional carriers typically rely on variables that often categorize consumers into demographic cohorts. As a result, insurtech companies are able to offer better value for their products and servicesâ\\x80\\x94tailored for a specific individual.  How do these insurtech companies create a different user experience?   Kelly Galanis: Insurtech companies are not burdened by legacy infrastructure and disconnected platforms. This allows them to truly leverage next-gen technology to quickly launch new (and, importantly, regulated) products that address customer needs and preferences. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a huge flywheel effect: If you can treat the customer wellâ\\x80\\x94for example by helping process claims quickly and transparentlyâ\\x80\\x94and deliver specific products that they need, then they will stay on the platform. This allows insurers to collect more data, which helps them provide a better experience and create tailored products, and ultimately allows them to grow fast. While insurtech companies are still young, the flywheel that empowers their business model allows them to generate strong customer retention and presumably decades-long customer relationships. Additionally, insurtech companies have mobile-centric or digital-first customer acquisition capabilities (in both personal lines and small- and medium-size business commercial lines). This has a two-pronged benefit: first, it creates a frictionless and even enjoyable customer onboarding experience and, secondly, companies see a material savings because these policies are sold directly instead of through an agent that is paid a commission on each policy sold. Over time, this will create a cost-to-acquire and cost-to serve advantage, allowing insurtech companies to efficiently grow market share.  How do insurtech startups address the capital and regulatory requirements that traditional insurers face?   Kelly Galanis: Insurtech companies typically rely on reinsurance arrangements that allow them to use a third-party balance sheet and remain capital light. Reinsurers that work with these insurtech companies are leading global reinsurers who, like traditional insurance companies, want to participate and invest in this space. And while some have expressed skepticism about an insurtech companyâ\\x80\\x99s ability to quickly and accurately underwrite risk, the fact that these companies are continuously improving their unit economics while improving their loss ratios indicates the model is working.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 28 July 2020  Last year saw a new trend in M&A involving Japanese companiesâ\\x80\\x94a sharp increase in large tender offers, including rarely seen hostile bids. The trend has continued in 2020, and may accelerate as a result of the pandemic. Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Hiromi Suzuki explains the changing times.  Can you explain the backdrop for M&A activity in Japan? How do current levels compare with the historical trend?  Hiromi Suzuki: Weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing a noticeable rise in tender offer activity, which is simply an offer to the shareholders of a publicly traded firm to purchase a portion or the entirety of their shareholdings. While this year is only just half over, the planned value of such offers to date in 2020 has risen to 3.0 trillion yen, with the countryâ\\x80\\x99s second- and third-largest ever offers announced during the first half. This already exceeds the previous record of 2.5 trillion yen for the full year of 2007. The pickup is being driven by an increase in large deals, with both the average and median values of planned tender offers at record highs in 2020.  What is driving the surge?  Hiromi Suzuki: Broadly speaking, corporate governance reforms and business restructuring are the key contributing factors. One long-standing bugbear among investors has been the prevalence of listed subsidiaries in Japan; there are still 281 such companies as of the end of June. These so-called parent-child listings have often been criticized for harboring potential conflicts of interest between the parent and minority shareholders of the listed subsidiaries, and make it more complicated to assess corporate value. In February, Japan Exchange Group, which operates the Tokyo Stock Exchange, announced revisions to listing regulations aimed at enhancing the governance of listed subsidiaries by tightening the criteria for independent directors and corporate auditors. Also from this year, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services has begun calling for at least one-third of directors in companies with a controlling shareholder to be independent.  Parent companies can use tender offers to take full control of a listed subsidiary by making it a wholly owned entity. And with the screws tightening, some Japanese firms are taking action to review their corporate structures and either buy out or sell off listed subsidiaries. These transactions accounted for the lionâ\\x80\\x99s share of tender offers in 2019.  COVID-19 is likely to be an additional spur for companies to review their capital structures. With the business environment likely to deteriorate further due to the pandemic, we expect more announcements of large-scale tender offers as parents look to shore up subsidiaries and improve their earnings by making them wholly owned or consolidated entities. As the total market capitalization of listed subsidiaries has fallen 8% this year through July 8, it is also cheaper for parents to execute these offers.  What about hostile takeovers? Havenâ\\x80\\x99t they traditionally been taboo in Japan?  Hiromi Suzuki: It is true that unsolicited tender offers have been rare in Japanâ\\x80\\x94and that successful bids are even more unusual. But the situation is changing dramatically. On the corporate side, the renewed focus on shareholder value means that companies themselves may be more willing to at least consider bidsâ\\x80\\x94unsolicited or otherwiseâ\\x80\\x94if a subsidiaryâ\\x80\\x99s sale would increase their capital efficiency. As a first step we are already seeing companies begin reviewing their capital ties with listed subsidiaries with an urgency unimaginable in previous years.  In line with the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s corporate governance reforms, domestic institutional investors have also become more keenly aware of their fiduciary duties to use their voting rights to encourage enterprise value growth. In other words, they are less likely to resist unsolicited tender offers if they deem the transaction value-accretive. This awareness has also made it more difficult for companies to maintain takeover defense strategiesâ\\x80\\x94or so-called â\\x80\\x9cpoison pills.â\\x80\\x9d Popular in Japan, these mechanisms allow companies to issue new shares, often at a discount, to existing and â\\x80\\x9cloyalâ\\x80\\x9d shareholders, diluting the stake of a potential acquirer. However, 2019 marked the first year where the number of companies abandoning takeover defense measures exceeded the number with them. This year, more than forty companies have said that they will give up such measures, reflecting the growing risk that they will not receive shareholder approval at annual general meetings. As a result, the potential for unsolicited bids to succeed has increased.  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the bottom line for investors?  Hiromi Suzuki: The progress of corporate governance in Japan, coupled with increasing numbers of activist investors operating in the market, is driving a wider discourse around the independence of Japanese companies and their accountability to shareholders. Given an ongoing focus on corporate reorganization to increase capital efficiency, and the fading resistance to hostile takeovers, we expect to see more tender offers, which could create interesting opportunities for investors going forward.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 14 July 2020  Consumer packaged food companies are changing the way they source raw ingredients to help reduce their environmental and social impact. Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Jason English spoke with Mary Jane Melendez, General Millsâ\\x80\\x99 Chief Sustainability and Social Impact Officer, Christine Montenegro McGrath, Mondelezâ\\x80\\x99s Chief of Global Impact, and Kate Rebernak, Founder and CEO of FrameworkESG, to discuss how consumer food companies are shaking up their supply chains. What follows is an edited excerpt of their conversation from Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 inaugural Global Consumer ESG Conference, held virtually last month.   Jason English: Kate, since you advise companies on their ESG strategies, can you set the stage and share how companiesâ\\x80\\x99 approaches are evolving?   Kate Rebernak: As more companies recognize ESG as a source of value, their stakeholders are becoming more sophisticated in their understanding of how sustainability factors can impact overall value. As a result, companies are trying to be more specific about making the connections between sustainability practices and the companyâ\\x80\\x99s data, vision and goals. Things have evolved because stakeholders are clearer in what they want to see from companies.   Jason English: How is the focus on sustainability playing out in Mondelez and General Mills?  Christine Montenegro McGrath: I would start out by saying that most successful companies today are creating value for the world at large, in addition to their own business, so understanding whatâ\\x80\\x99s material for your business and the broader impact you can have is essential. Part of that is being consumer-centric and understanding that consumers are increasingly aware of the connection that their choices have on the environment and their own well-being. At Mondelez, since weâ\\x80\\x99re one of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s largest buyers of cocoa, itâ\\x80\\x99s critical to have a strong supply of cocoa and be able to drive systemic change through our sustainability programs. Through our Cocoa Life program, for example, weâ\\x80\\x99re able to help the farmers we source ingredients from, as well as the communities that we buy from. At the same time, we need to drive change in broader ways by working with governments and industry players. Some of these complex challenges are just too great for any one company to solve, so we also need to share best practices and knowledge, and build scale.  Mary Jane Melendez: Consumers expect brands to be a force for good. For us, itâ\\x80\\x99s really about thinking about how we can activate our operations in a way that builds both business and planetary resilience. Given the impact of climate change and extreme weather events on our business, itâ\\x80\\x99s critical for us to look up and down our supply chain. We also work with the farmers who grow our key ingredientsâ\\x80\\x94such as oatsâ\\x80\\x94to ensure that weâ\\x80\\x99re sustainably sourcing those ingredients. As a food company, our business very much depends on the health and well-being of Mother Nature.  Jason English: What types of companies have been most active in ESG and how has investor interest evolved?   Kate Rebernak: What Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen is that the heavily regulated businessesâ\\x80\\x94for example, oil and gas, mining, and cement manufacturingâ\\x80\\x94got a head start on implementing ESG strategies because they needed the social license to operate. And there has been greater engagement from the investor community. Five years ago, institutional investors werenâ\\x80\\x99t as interested in doing a deep dive on ESG. Now all of them are. Weâ\\x80\\x99re also seeing greater engagement from companiesâ\\x80\\x99 senior leadershipâ\\x80\\x94if theyâ\\x80\\x99re not driving the strategies themselves, then they are actively supporting them. And this interest is across all sectors.   Jason English: Mary Jane and Christine, can you talk about some of the supply chain initiatives that youâ\\x80\\x99re engaged in at your companies?   Mary Jane Melendez: At General Mills, one of the areas weâ\\x80\\x99re focused on is regenerative agriculture, which uses a holistic, principles-based approach to farming and ranching that seeks to strengthen both the ecosystem and community resilience. Itâ\\x80\\x99s one of many levers that farmers can use to address planetary health. Weâ\\x80\\x99re currently running a pilot with 46 farmersâ\\x80\\x94who are responsible for more than 50,000 acresâ\\x80\\x94who will be applying principles of regenerative agriculture on their land over a three- to five-year period. The pilot is already showing strong results. In the first year, farmers have been able to spend less on synthetic inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, and instead are reinvesting more money into cover crops for their lands. By minimizing soil disturbance and maximizing crop diversity, famers can not only improve soil health, but also improve biodiversity and water quality on their farmsâ\\x80\\x94while creating more economic resiliency for their communities.  Christine Montenegro McGrath: We know that about 60% of our CO2 emissions come from our ingredients, so we have several initiatives focused on increasing the sustainability of our supply chain. The Cocoa Life program I mentioned earlier was launched in 2012 with the goal of helping farmers grow more cocoa on less land, while also providing them with access to sustainable farming practices, financing and training. Weâ\\x80\\x99re now working with more than 175,000 farmers and about 60% of the cocoa volume for our chocolateâ\\x80\\x94which is used in products such as Cadbury and Tobleroneâ\\x80\\x94is currently sourced through the program; our target is 100% by 2025. Today, weâ\\x80\\x99re working with farmers to ensure that the way the cocoa is grown is helping to solve deforestation on the ground while also helping to provide more income to the women in these communities, who typically do about 40% of the work on the cocoa farms. Another one of our initiatives, Harmony Wheat, works with farmers to ensure that wheat is grown in a way that promotes soil health and biodiversity, while also helping farmers to cultivate the bees and wildflowers on their farms that are so important to the long-term health of the environment.   Jason English: What, if any, changes to the ESG dialogue discussion do you think will result from COVID-19?  Kate Rebernak: In past crises, we would typically see companies dial back their attention to ESG issues. But weâ\\x80\\x99re not seeing that right now. Because of the pandemic and the protests over racial injustice, companies are realizing that they need to continue to address social issues in ways that are both authentic and meaningful. Company leaders will need to build structures internally and throughout their value chains to insulate the business against some of the environmental impacts and create resilience. There are also expectations that company leaders need to speak out on issues, engage with policymakers and address issues such as paid sick leave, healthcare issues and pay equity. ESG concerns arenâ\\x80\\x99t going away and, in fact, are interconnected with many of the issues weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing right now.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 08 July 2020  Just as the pandemic has accelerated a shift to online learning, it is also reshaping the college application process. On a recent client webcast, Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 John Mallory, who leads the firmâ\\x80\\x99s Americas Private Wealth Management business, spoke with Amy Alexander and Sai Samboon of Bright Horizons College Coach about the trends shaping the college admissions process.  John Mallory: The pandemic has affected numerous aspects of higher education, from in-person classes and university endowments, to the college admissions cycle. Amy and Sai, given your experience working with colleges and families, what are some of notable changes youâ\\x80\\x99re seeing in the application process?   Amy Alexander: One of the biggest changes weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing now is in the area of standardized testing. Nearly every day, another university is announcing a move to a test-optional policy, meaning that scores from college entrance exams, such as the SAT or ACT, are not required for admission. While some schools have suspended exam requirements for the duration of the pandemic, others are taking a longer-term approach. Tufts University, for example, has said it was going test optional for the next three years.  Students should still do their research to determine each's school testing requirements since there is so much differentiation and school policies are changing weeklyâ\\x80\\x94even daily.  As a practical matter, we would recommend that students try to take the SAT or ACTâ\\x80\\x94register, prepare and assume the test will still be required by some collegesâ\\x80\\x94and prioritize taking those exams over subject matter placement tests. If youâ\\x80\\x99re truly not able to take them, colleges will understand, but great to do if you can. If you have strong test scores, you can still submit them.  Sai Samboon: To give you a sense of how the move has accelerated, with more than 4,000 colleges in the US today, more than 1,000 of them are going test-optional or test-flexible. That means more than half of the top 100 liberal arts college are test optional. Universities could continue to soften their stance on testing, such as accepting results from later testing dates. Overall, universities are going to shift their emphasis to other elements of an applicantâ\\x80\\x99s profile.        John Mallory: One of the questions that we are hearing from clientsâ\\x80\\x94and that comes up in my own household as wellâ\\x80\\x94is what should kids being doing during the lockdown to build up their experiences when many traditional opportunities have been put on hold?  Sai Samboon: For any student applying to college in the next few years, colleges will be putting a giant asterisk next to their experiences in the spring of 2020. Everyone is in the same boat and colleges understand that this situation is affecting all of us. At the same time, there are many ways for students to continue to do the things they love to doâ\\x80\\x94and demonstrate their interest and progress inâ\\x80\\x94even if theyâ\\x80\\x99re sheltering at home.   Amy Alexander: While most in-person summer camps, pre-college programs, travel, internships, and sports training have been canceled, there are still many enriching ways that teens can positively impact their community, grow academically and personally, and continue to thoughtfully prepare for college. For example, they can check in their local cultural, service and faith-based organizations to see if they can volunteer for service-related opportunities. At a time when many high schools are forgoing letter grades, students can strengthen their college application by taking a graded academic summer class. If your teen is interested in STEM activities, they can cook a dinner inspired by different science-based diets, or create a virtual science project for kids in the neighborhood. There are plenty of opportunities for those interested in the arts and culture as well, such as virtual museum tours, online lectures and virtual opportunities to practice a foreign language. And student athletes should work with their high school and club coaches to get home workouts and strategies for next season.   John Mallory: How has the pandemic, with its economic impact and travel restrictions, affected the pool of college applicants?   Sai Samboon: International students represent a significant percentage of the student population at US universities. Given the restrictions on travel and delays in processing student visas, many international students arenâ\\x80\\x99t able to accept or have delayed their admission offers for this fallâ\\x80\\x94and this is causing a huge domino effect. Facing tuition shortfalls, since many international students tend to pay full tuition, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing some colleges admit many more students off of their wait listsâ\\x80\\x94and at a faster paceâ\\x80\\x94than they have historically.  Amy Alexander: The pandemic will also sharply compress the time that students have in the fall to apply for early decision or early action programsâ\\x80\\x94which, depending on the school, are binding. We could see a difficult fall semester for many high school seniors because they will be rushing to get in their applications under tighter deadlines. In some cases, we could see more colleges offer early decision II options â\\x80\\x94 which essentially allow students to wait until later in the admissions cycle to claim their allegiance to a particular school. And just last month, for example, Princeton University dropped its non-binding early action application deadline due to COVID-19 and will only offer one application deadline for the 2020-2021 cycle.  John Mallory: One of the themes weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen across a variety of industries is that the pandemic appears to have accelerated underlying trends. Are there any changes in college admissions that you think are likely to stay, and do you have any advice for managing through the uncertainty?  Sai Samboon: Colleges have been moving toward virtual learning for some timeâ\\x80\\x94the pandemic has accelerated that trend. In the fall, itâ\\x80\\x99s not clear what to expect. Many colleges have been moving toward a hybrid approach, with a mix of in-person and virtual classes, due in part to financial pressures and safety precautions. But given where weâ\\x80\\x99re at with the virus, we could also see a completely virtual fall.  I think itâ\\x80\\x99s possible that students in the near future will be getting a full liberal arts education with more than half of it provided online.   Amy Alexander: Since everything is so uncertain, itâ\\x80\\x99s even more important to do oneâ\\x80\\x99s researchâ\\x80\\x94whether itâ\\x80\\x99s about the schoolâ\\x80\\x99s testing policy, application deadlines or even its financial health. Many small liberal arts college, for example, are largely dependent on tuition revenue and lack a large endowment. So, if they donâ\\x80\\x99t have full-pay students returning in the fall, theyâ\\x80\\x99re going to be hurting. But because weâ\\x80\\x99re often quick to react to the worse-case scenarios, I would advise students to just â\\x80\\x98stay on their own matsâ\\x80\\x99 and keep doing what they would have already done. Some things are just out of our control.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 30 June 2020  The airline industry has faced its fair share of crises, but the coronavirus has pushed it into new territory. Greg Lee of Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Investment Banking Division looks at how some airlines are weathering the pandemic.  Greg, many of the transportation clients you adviseâ\\x80\\x94airlines, the cruise sector and railroads among othersâ\\x80\\x94have been among the hardest hit in the pandemic. How is the airline industry coping?   Greg Lee: The airlines are experiencing a stress environment that is, by far, the worst that theyâ\\x80\\x99ve ever been throughâ\\x80\\x94even worse than the September 11, 2001 attacks. And this is an industry that has experienced multiple black swan events that have significantly hurt it as a whole. That said, the industry is in much better shape today than it was in 2001 due to consolidation, lower fuel prices and better management.  The big concerns for airlines right now is not so much whether there will be a return of demand. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s confidence that people will want to fly again and the industryâ\\x80\\x99s already seeing pockets of recovery in places like China. Rather, the big question is whether airlines will be able to survive between now and thenâ\\x80\\x94and thatâ\\x80\\x99s a question of liquidity and self-help.  Governments have provided various forms of aid packages to airlines. What other steps are airlines taking to bolster their balance sheets?         Greg Lee: We estimate that governments around the world have provided over $100 billion of aid to the airline sectorâ\\x80\\x94with many governments encouraging the industry to supplement that aid with capital from the private sector. The International Air Transport Association, the airline industryâ\\x80\\x99s trade association, has estimated the industry needs approximately $300 billion to survive the operating losses from the declines in passenger traffic over the next six to 12 months. So airlines are tapping the capital markets in a variety of ways to help them through a situation where they have little revenue coming in and significant fixed costs.   What are the financing options that airlines are pursuing and how has the crisis affected those efforts?  Greg Lee: In less turbulent times, an airline looking to raise capital would issue debt and in certain extraordinary circumstances equity linked or equity.  And weâ\\x80\\x99re still seeing these types of transactions.  But during the COVID-19 crisis, a stock or bond offering may not be enough to provide sufficient capital, so multiple securities have to be combined and executed to provide momentum and confidence that the issuer is raising sufficient liquidity. And today, many institutional investors have the flexibility and mandate to invest across equities and bonds. These so-called â\\x80\\x9cbig bangâ\\x80\\x9d financings are a complex choreography of timing and execution between different product groups that are all dependent on each other. The typical rescue package is a combination of high yield debt and equityâ\\x80\\x94often a dual tranche offering of common stock and convertible bondsâ\\x80\\x94that is structured in such a way that each product is executed and priced at the same time.  Airlines are also exploring innovative ways to raise capital, including tapping the value of their frequent-flier programs. Last week, we structured and executed a multi-billion financing for a major airline whichâ\\x80\\x94for the first timeâ\\x80\\x94used the stable cash flows from its mileage program as collateral. The transaction was the largest-ever capital markets offering in the airline sector.  What was your teamâ\\x80\\x99s role on these transactions?   Greg Lee: We were able to build on the rescue financings we executed for major cruise lines earlier this year, and customize those kind of transactions for the airline industry. While the bulk of our work has been with the airlines, weâ\\x80\\x99ve also helped governments design rescue packages for the industry. In early June, our team in Hong Kong advised on the second-largest government-led industry package in Asia. For many of our clients, this is often unchartered territory where their Treasury teams could be issuing junior capital for the first time in their careers during a time of uncertainty and existential threat.  For our part, I believe our firmâ\\x80\\x99s culture of communication and cooperation, as well as our â\\x80\\x9cOne Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x9d initiative to deliver the firmâ\\x80\\x99s resources in a more holistic fashion, makes us uniquely well positioned to work on these transactions since they require precise coordination and teamwork across product groups within Investment Banking, Global Markets and Merchant Banking Divisions.  What has been the investor reception to these types of financings?   Greg Lee: We have seen deep and broad-based interest from a combination of blue-chip, long-only investors and large asset managers, as well as structured finance buyers, investors in collateralized loan obligations, pension funds, hedge funds and the credit arms of large private equity firms. In some cases, the total size and package plays a key role in investorsâ\\x80\\x99 decision to invest. If the transaction is successfully executed and the size is large enough, then the risk of bankruptcy is significantly reduced. That said, investors are being judicious about which deals to invest in, so you have to bring transactions to market that are smart and thoughtful.  Going forward, the industry will undoubtedly go through a difficult period and we are concerned about a weak operating environment in 2021. However, we are bullish about the industry overall as airline travel is akin to a public utility and is critically important for the economy, leisure and business over the longer term.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 24 June 2020  The music industry, propelled by the rise in music streaming services, has seen the value of its assets skyrocket. We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Aaron Siegel to discuss how the industry is seeking to grow in the midst of a pandemic.   In early June, Goldman Sachs took Warner Music public in one of the largest US initial public offerings this year. What does that IPO say about the industry?   Aaron Siegel: Thereâ\\x80\\x99s been an enormous resurgence in the valuation of music assets. We saw strong investor interest in Warner Musicâ\\x80\\x99s initial public offering â\\x80\\x94 which priced in the upper half of the expected range and has since traded higher.  Despite the COVID-19 disruption, we were able to execute the roadshow virtually and reach a strong investor base in a shorter period of time.   Warnerâ\\x80\\x99s IPO follows a period of growing valuations in the private M&A market, including a Tencent-led consortiumâ\\x80\\x99s investment in Universal Music and the sale of EMI Music Publishing to Sony. All three of these transactions reflected substantial growth in value for the owners of the music businesses, who, like Access Industries with Warner, had purchased or owned these businesses during a period of challenge and transition for the music industry. Access invested approximately $1 billion in equity to purchase Warner Music in 2011 (a transaction that was announced before Spotify had launched its service in the US); today, Warner Musicâ\\x80\\x99s market capitalization is approximately $17 billion.  What has contributed to that growth?        Aaron Siegel: The Warner Music IPO echoed many of the same themes expressed during Spotifyâ\\x80\\x99s direct listing two years ago â\\x80\\x94 in particular the extraordinary value created by the collaboration of artists, music content owners and the music streaming services.  The industry has undergone a complete renaissance.  When I started covering the business 17 years ago, the music industry was in the midst of online piracy challenges and collapsing CD sales. It was depressing at times for the music companies â\\x80\\x93 particularly when they were forced to cut costs to try and preserve profitability. The paid streaming model brought the business back to health again. The industry in the early 2000s was massively shrinking. Today, itâ\\x80\\x99s seeing sustained long-term growth.  Warner Musicâ\\x80\\x99s recent listing is a testament to the industryâ\\x80\\x99s strength.   What accounts for the popularity behind the streaming model and how will the industry expand from here?   Aaron Siegel: The value proposition for consumers is extraordinary which has driven widespread adoption around the world. Itâ\\x80\\x99s consumer friendly, with applications that get delivered to consumers when they want, while the research and development invested in the digital platforms creates personalized recommendations and strong playlists. Consumers typically pay a small monthly cost for â\\x80\\x9call-you-can-accessâ\\x80\\x9d music. Since many of these services offer a free tier to allow consumers to try out the service, the conversion rates to becoming paid subscriptions are very high.  The flexibility of an on-demand service has only reinforced the value of these streaming services during this period of dramatic change for everyoneâ\\x80\\x99s work, commutes and living schedules.  There is still meaningful headroom for continued growth in paid subscriptions as consumers continue to adopt music streaming around the world â\\x80\\x93 in both developed markets and emerging markets. And there are also promising signs for growth in pricing for the music industry. In some markets that were early adopters, such as Sweden, Spotify has begun to experiment with higher pricing, while Amazon Music is offering a higher pricing tier for a higher level of audio. The industry is primed for overall growth as well as the potential for higher pricing over time.  How have changes in consumer behavior affected the music industry?   Aaron Siegel: The consumer is absorbing more audio content than before partly because of the popularity of AirPods and wireless earbuds, as well as the proliferation of smart speakers and devices in homes, many of which are typically used to play music. Both trends are broadening the consumption of music as well as the type of music that gets played. For example, parents who set up a smart speaker in their childâ\\x80\\x99s bedrooms are more likely to stream child-focused songs, which opens up new catalogs of music. People are interacting with music more and in different ways through the proliferation of audio devices across our lives. And every year there are new services that incorporate and license music, like Peloton for example, that deepen consumer engagement with music and broaden the industryâ\\x80\\x99s revenue base.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 16 June 2020  After a decade-long bull run, mergers and acquisition activity slowed sharply earlier this year as global economies came to a halt. But there are signs of life in the M&A market as countries start to reopen, according to the global co-heads of Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Mergers & Acquisitions business in the Investment Banking Divisionâ\\x80\\x94Michael Carr, Dusty Philip and Gilberto Pozziâ\\x80\\x94who shared their outlooks on the year ahead.  Michael, your team recently completed an analysis of M&A cycles over the past 30 years. How does the current downturn compare with past historical cycles?   Michael Carr: Our analysis shows that there have been three significant M&A down cycles over the last three decadesâ\\x80\\x94in 1990 and 1991; in 2001 and 2002; and in 2008 and 2009. During each of those downturns, M&A volumes declined by about 50 percent over a two-year period followed by another three to six years before volumes recovered to their prior peaks. Of course, all M&A cycles are unique and this pullback is different than the most recent downturns. For one, event-driven downturns like the current one typically recover more quickly than ones caused by cyclical or secular forces. In addition, companies across sectors as well as financial services firms were generally in strong shape before this shock and, as a result, are well positioned to act quickly as the economy recovers. To be sure, the uniqueness of this pandemic has far reaching implications for industry profitability, valuations and deal structuring, among other things.  Where are we in the current down cycle, and are you seeing any signs of a pickup?         Michael Carr: While every cycle is unique, recoveries after severe downturns tend to follow three types of â\\x80\\x9cwaves.â\\x80\\x9d The first wave is characterized by involuntary M&A deals, such as bankruptcy sales or forced asset sales to generate liquidity. These are largely board-instituted transactions that are done when companies have limited options and are just trying to survive. We believe weâ\\x80\\x99ve entered the second wave of M&A, known as â\\x80\\x9cnear-in M&A,â\\x80\\x9d where management teams are looking close to home for potential combinations or joint ventures as a way to reduce transaction risks. In April, for example, we advised Prudential Financial on the sale of its life insurance business in Korea to Korean financial services provider KB Financial Group. Mergers between similar companies or close competitors tend to create situations where realized synergies represent a larger percentage of earnings. The third M&A wave is when you see transactions geared to creating growth, such as acquisitions of non-core businesses and cross-border transactions.   What could be different about the current down cycle and recovery?  Dusty Philip: As Michael noted, we believe this current down cycle is likely to be relatively short-lived and, based on our conversations with clients, we expect a meaningful pickup in the second half of this year. Private equityâ\\x80\\x94which is sitting on an estimated $1.5 trillion of dry powderâ\\x80\\x94is taking a larger, more active role in this environment, especially private investments in public equity. In previous downturns we have seen significant pent up demand for M&A transactions drive a higher level of strategic activity during the recovery.  We expect all-stock transactions to predominate as this structure allows both parties in a transaction to benefit in the upside as the economy recovers.   How will the pandemic shape the types of deals that weâ\\x80\\x99re likely to see?  Dusty Philip: We continue to see a high level of strategic ambition from clients, although we anticipate that strategic priorities will shift as a result of the pandemic. Several trends that have been in place for years have accelerated over the last few months. In particular, clients are likely to prioritize technology investments in response to accelerated digitalization in many industry sectors. Also, we have seen an increased emphasis by clients on ESG issues during this downturn with particular emphasis on employees, diversity and the environment.  How has the pandemic affected global M&A trends?   Gilberto Pozzi: Prior to COVID-19, we had already seen a slowdown in cross-border transactions, a pickup in domestic consolidation and a move toward protectionist strategies. COVID-19 accelerated those trends. Today, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing more governments across the world tighten the rules on foreign investments in prized firms and sectors in their countries. And in China, where concerns over tariffs and trade had been rising last year, we expect to see a rise in domestic consolidation and a more challenging backdrop for outbound M&A.  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s your outlook going forward?   Gilberto Pozzi: With the equity and debt markets stabilizing, and based on our dialogue with clients, we expect to see more M&A in the second half of this year and in 2021 with volumes returning pre-COVID levels. Many transactions have been put on hold rather than cancelled, and therefore we expect those deals to come back once the conditions are right. Large companies, for their part, are weathering the crisis better than smaller ones, while in Europeâ\\x80\\x94which still needs to deal with Brexitâ\\x80\\x94we expect to see more efforts to create national and European champions.'},\n",

For me, I took Ahmaud Arberyâ\\x80\\x99s murder hardâ\\x80\\x94not only because he looked like a grown-up version of my sonâ\\x80\\x94but also because it took two months before anyone was arrested. Then, in the same week, we had the Amy Cooper situation in New York and George Floydâ\\x80\\x99s murderâ\\x80\\x94it was just the tipping point. For the Black communityâ\\x80\\x94with our history and all that we go through every day on a micro level â\\x80\\x94we finally got to a place where we couldnâ\\x80\\x99t take it anymore.  Leke Osinubi: In many ways, what weâ\\x80\\x99ve observed with George Floydâ\\x80\\x99s murder isnâ\\x80\\x99t new; itâ\\x80\\x99s just that weâ\\x80\\x99ve only now had more opportunities to capture it. For me, his murder was the apex of all the frustration and exhaustion Iâ\\x80\\x99ve felt. The length of timeâ\\x80\\x948 minutesâ\\x80\\x94that the officerâ\\x80\\x99s knee was on his neck was representative of the knee thatâ\\x80\\x99s been on the necks of Black men and women throughout history, and represents the system that continues to work against progress. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the constant reminder of our social position. The officer standing by silently was representative of othersâ\\x80\\x99 complicity in that murder and in the systemic oppression of Black people. My story is the same as their stories; we arenâ\\x80\\x99t any different. As Black men weâ\\x80\\x99re taught to be strong and not to cry because one day weâ\\x80\\x99re going to have to serve as images of strength for our families, but in essence we canâ\\x80\\x99t even protect ourselves. The irony that George Floyd died with someone kneeling on his neck, when African Americanâ\\x80\\x99s have been kneeling in peaceful protest for the last four years, is telling of my existenceâ\\x80\\x94and thatâ\\x80\\x99s when I said enough was enough.  Sean Legister: For me, the Amy Cooper situation in Central Park was more terrifying. Because while George Floydâ\\x80\\x99s murder wasnâ\\x80\\x99t expected, it also wasnâ\\x80\\x99t surprising. But the moment I step outside of the offices of Goldman Sachs, Iâ\\x80\\x99m just another Black man in America. And in most situations, if I were in a situation where it would be my word against the â\\x80\\x9cAmy Cooperâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d of the world, I think Iâ\\x80\\x99d lose that battle every time. The subtle racism also comes across when people say that they donâ\\x80\\x99t see you as Blackâ\\x80\\x94that they donâ\\x80\\x99t, in fact, see color. But if you donâ\\x80\\x99t see color, then youâ\\x80\\x99re not seeing a huge part of who I am. Or they may have a different perception of what it means to be Black and perhaps I donâ\\x80\\x99t fit that stereotype.  Kene Ejikeme: In London, the UK and parts of EMEA, the Black experience is more of a summation of micro-aggressions. Do you want to get shot and killed, or die by a thousand cuts? For me, the Amy Cooper incident was the one that hit me personally the hardest and made me reflect about what that means for my place in society. On a day-to-day basis, there are so many little things that are happening in real time that are just too many to address. Whether Iâ\\x80\\x99m tryingâ\\x80\\x94without successâ\\x80\\x94to hail a taxi or getting on the tube and seeing mothers pull their children or daughters away from me. By the time Iâ\\x80\\x99ve gotten to the office Iâ\\x80\\x99ve already sustained multiple â\\x80\\x9ccuts.â\\x80\\x9d With everything happening in the world, Iâ\\x80\\x99m just reliving those moments all over again. The problems in the UK are just as ugly, pernicious and debilitating as they are in the USâ\\x80\\x94they just take a different form.        Margaret Anadu: During my analyst days at the firm, a colleague yelled at me while I was getting my breakfastâ\\x80\\x94likely assuming I worked in the cafeteria because Iâ\\x80\\x99m Black. When I got back to my desk, visibly upset, my manager at the time asked what was wrong and when I told her, without missing a beat, she immediately wanted to find the woman and address the situation. Today, a lot of people are asking: â\\x80\\x9cWhat can I do and what do I say?â\\x80\\x9d The answer is to just be with us. The ability to confront these racial issues and create allies depends on building relationships with people long before a crisis. My manager and I had a relationship that was real and genuine before the incident. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a lot easier to talk about something thatâ\\x80\\x99s difficult when youâ\\x80\\x99ve spent real time talking about things that arenâ\\x80\\x99t difficult.  Lisa Opoku: Can you talk about your experiences in terms of how youâ\\x80\\x99re dealing with parenting in these times, or conversations that your parents may have had to help you understand racial inequality?  Leke Osinubi: For my daughter, weâ\\x80\\x99ve had some extremely tough conversations where I want her to fully embrace who she is. I try to empower her to understand her own internal strength, but at the same time, realize that sheâ\\x80\\x99s not going to be living in a fairy tale. There was a point in time when I was trying to protect and shield her from racism, but realized that was a disservice.  Sean Legister: For me, my mom is my everything. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s a single mom from Jamaica who raised me to work hard, but not be too loud so I can fit in. When I went away to Amherst College, I told my mom I wanted to major in Black Studies. Her response was that if I wanted to learn about Black people I should go to the library and read a book. She had wanted to see me major in math or economics. But a couple of months later when Barack Obama won the presidency, she called me crying and told me I should major in Black Studies and chase my dream. Within the firm, weâ\\x80\\x99re trying to use our voices to educate others and work to bring about more changes. We can do better. Iâ\\x80\\x99m hopeful that since I can bring my authentic self to work that will open the door for others.  Lisa Opoku: Margaret, what are you hearing in your conversations with the analysts and associates across the firm at this time?  Margaret Anadu: Itâ\\x80\\x99s a mix of experiences. Many feel optimistic about the future, while others are anxious and deeply distressed. Youâ\\x80\\x99re not only dealing with the actual reality of whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on outside your doors and feeling alone and exposed, but for some this is exacerbated by the silence they feel from others. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve all heard that to be silent is to be complicit. So even an awkwardly worded email or note to someone who is in pain is better than nothing. Weâ\\x80\\x99re certainly having more conversations so thatâ\\x80\\x99s real progress. But we have to continue to be honest and vulnerable.  Lisa Opoku: Kene, youâ\\x80\\x99ve been a leader in the Black community in London for a long time. What kinds of changes do you think need to happen to effect real change?  Kene Ejikeme: I would encourage the conversation to pivot from, â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t discriminate because itâ\\x80\\x99s not a good thing to do and youâ\\x80\\x99re a good person,â\\x80\\x9d to a conversation that having a more diverse firm contributes to the bottom line and enables us to drive a better return for our shareholders. I would like to see greater transparency around that and include more people in those conversations. Weâ\\x80\\x99re an analytical, data-driven firm and when we put numerical targets on things we magically seem to hit them. We also need to create a web of accountability where managers who do a good job managing diverse teams get paid more and are promoted.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 03 June 2020  The pandemic is accelerating the adoption of financial technology, known as fintech, among consumers, businesses and government entities. Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Jeff Gido and Brandon Watkins of the Investment Banking Division shared their insights on the secular trends driving fintech growth and how the shift to online working and shopping is creating opportunities in the sector.   How has the economic shutdown affected the fintech sector?  Jeff Gido: The fintech sector has been hurt by the sharp decline in overall transactions and payments volumes. Anything to do with travel, tourism, restaurants and entertainment, for example, is down 70% to 90% year-over-year while cross-border transactions are down 50%. But companies are also reporting payment volume increases in everyday spending categories, such as food and grocery stores, and weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a sharp acceleration and shift to e-commence as people buy and order items from home. Over the long term, we expect these fintech trends to accelerate as more consumers turn to digital and contactless payments, as well as order-ahead apps, in an environment where more people are likely to work from home.  Meanwhile, fintech companies that provide mission-critical software to banks and businesses have been doing well due to an embedded base of users who are contributing recurring revenues.   Brandon Watkins: The current environment has only accelerated the need and expectation for financial services to be delivered in a 100% digital environment as the shutdown has forced people to conduct critical financial activities and banking functions, such depositing checks or paying bills, online and over their phones.  This not only creates a great opportunity for next generation digital finance platforms to drive efficient customer acquisition but also an opportunity for these digital platforms to prove their differentiated value proposition versus traditional providers.      Jeff, youâ\\x80\\x99ve talked in the past about the three waves of fintech marked by a surge of startups in the first wave; efforts by the incumbents to build their own capabilities in a second wave; and a third wave marked by collaboration between the established players and startups. How has the virus changed that trajectory?        Jeff Gido: The pandemic has really accelerated fintech development beyond the third wave where weâ\\x80\\x99re not only seeing more partnership dialogue but also more mergers and acquisition activity.  Just last month, for example, personal finance start-up SoFi just agreed to buy Galileo, a payments processor which it had been working with since early last year. While overall M&A is down, the rationale for strategic and transformational deals will continue even if it takes a pause.    Brandon Watkins: Last year, the trend was consolidation among large incumbents where we advised on TSYSâ\\x80\\x99 $25 billion merger with Global Payments andâ\\x80\\x94in the largest fintech deal everâ\\x80\\x94Fidelity National Information Servicesâ\\x80\\x99 $43 billion acquisition of Worldpay. This year, the trend has been large established companies acquiring high-growth, next-generation start-ups: We sold Plaid to Visa for $5.3 billion and Credit Karma to Intuit for $7.1 billion, and weâ\\x80\\x99re likely to see this trend continue.  Even the government, in its efforts to get stimulus dollars into consumer bank accounts more quickly, has turned to digital finance platforms.  Consumer digital finance payment platforms were at the forefront of enabling stimulus funds to be sent directly to consumer bank accounts through simple API integration with the US government, which was particularly impactful for those consumers who didnâ\\x80\\x99t have their bank account information on file with the IRS.  Additionally, many digital finance platforms, particularly ones with large small- and medium-sized business ecosystems, were directly involved in the distribution of Paycheck Protection Program loans to businesses in need.  How are fintech trends playing out globally?  Jeff Gido: We have seen tremendous amounts of activity throughout Latin America, particularly in Brazil with its highly concentrated banking sector, as well as in Mexico and Colombia, as fintech platforms make it easier for a rising middle class to access traditional banking services.   Brandon Watkins: There are similar trends in Asia which has long been at the forefront of digital financial solutions given how payment technologies have evolved in the region. Instead of going from cash to credit cards to mobile payments, consumers in Asia leapfrogged credit cards and went straight from using cash to mobile payments. As a result, there is a large, centralized ecosystem of mobile users throughout Asia which companies, such as WeChat Pay and Alipay, are now monetizing through the delivery of other financial services, such as savings accounts, loans and insurance products.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 26 May 2020  As one of the longest-tenured CEOs on Wall Street, Jefferies Financial Group CEO Rich Handler says the current crisis is unlike any heâ\\x80\\x99s ever seen and will have profound effects on the economy, consumer behavior and the future of work. Speaking at a virtual Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) Forum event, Handler shared his thoughts with Katie Koch, co-head of GSAMâ\\x80\\x99s Fundamental Equity business.  Katie Koch: Given your long tenure on Wall Street, how does this crisis compare with all the previous ones you have managed through? What will the eventual economic recovery look like in terms of timing and velocity?     Rich Handler: What makes this crisis so dramatic is the health component. After past crises, we were able to go back out in the world, whereas the health risks of this virus adds a complexity that is rattling everyone. On top of that, this crisis affects everyone. Even the companies that appear to be resilient, such as enterprise software companies, are affected because their clients are in a lot of pain and are focused on reducing costs due to disruptions to their business models. This will filter through the entire world in terms of corporate earnings power and economies.  But compared with prior crisisâ\\x80\\x94which, with the exception of 9/11, were preceded by rumblings of problemsâ\\x80\\x94the economy was in solid shape going into it. Unemployment, inflation and interest rates were all low, the economy was strong, liquidity was great and banks were in a good position. The fact that the economy was in a strong position going into this will make it easier to pull ourselves out.  That said, if I were to assign a letter to the shape of the recovery, it would be an â\\x80\\x9cXâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94no one knows what the recovery will look like as there are so many unknown variables about the virus. The issue is that you need a recovery in demand for the economy to recover. Just because the government opens up cities again doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean the economy is open again. We will be open again when people feel safe and that will take time. The demand side of the equation will take time to come back.        Katie Koch: At GSAM, while we acknowledge the sheer magnitude of policy support, we still have been somewhat surprised by the resilience of equity markets in the face of what is likely to be the worst economic contraction in almost a century. What is your take on this?  Rich Handler: Many market indices are performing well due to the performance of large technology companies, which make up a significant portion of these indices. However, when you take a closer look at the individual names in the indices, you will find stocks that are disproportionally beaten up and reflect the reality of the moment better than some of these larger tech companies. This bodes well for the approach of active management versus passive management over the next two to five years.  Katie Koch: At Jefferies Financial Group, you and the team specialize in companies from $2bn to $10bn of market cap. Do you expect to see consolidation in this part of the market as a result of some of the stresses these companies are facing? What do you think about small cap stocks as an investment opportunity at this point in the cycle?  Rich Handler: It depends on your duration of capital. If you are looking at this over a long-term investment horizon, the valuations in small- to mid-cap companies are very good relative to large cap. Earlier in the year, we saw a lot of strategic offensive deals occurring across every industryâ\\x80\\x94most of these are on hold now. Now, most of the activity weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing is along the lines of capital market arbitrage. The smartest companies and CEOs right now are focused on extending their runway to get through this given the duration is unknown. This differentiates management teams that are being proactive from those that are in denial about the shape and speed of the recovery. The companies that are going to make it will be the ones that are focused on extending their runway and being proactive rather than the ones that are waiting around for government aid they may not receive.  Katie Koch: At GSAM, we are spending a lot of time debating the legacies of the COVID-19 crisis. When you look out over the next few years do you expect regulatory change, such as restrictions on capital allocation in certain industries? What changes to consumer behavior do you and the team anticipate?  Rich Handler: Unlike the global financial crisis, no one is at fault here so there shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be as much regulatory change as there was after 2008. That said, it all depends on what happens with the US presidential election in November. In the meantime, we are likely to see a further widening between the â\\x80\\x9chavesâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9chave-notsâ\\x80\\x9d as the parts of the economy that arenâ\\x80\\x99t able to work from home are more likely to suffer from the disease and experience a loss of income. This will be a very divisive event to happen in times of political change from a regulatory perspective.  The way consumers behave coming out of this crisis will depend on the medical solution. For example, if we can develop solutions that decrease fatality rates or therapies that keep ICU admissions low, we could see people returning to many of their pre-crisis behaviors, but even then, the world will be different. The crisis, will have many ramifications on the future of work: we wonâ\\x80\\x99t need as much real estate; our people will have a better quality of life; and we should see more opportunities for women raising families as companies can no longer argue that workplace flexibility is a limiting factor.

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 19 May 2020  Bill Bynum is the CEO of HOPE, a Community Development Financial Institution in Jackson, Mississippi, with whom Goldman Sachs is partnering to get capital in the hands of small businesses. Margaret Anadu, head of the Merchant Banking Divisionâ\\x80\\x99s Urban Investment Group (UIG) at Goldman Sachs, spoke recently with Bynum about the status of those efforts.  Margaret Anadu: Through 10,000 Small Businesses and UIG, we have partnered with CDFIs for over a decade to create stronger, more inclusive communities. Bill, as the CEO of a CDFI in Jackson, Miss., can you explain what makes CDFIs different from traditional banks?   Bill Bynum: CDFIs can take on many formsâ\\x80\\x94from nonprofit housing and business loan funds, to regulated banks and credit unions. Some are small and hyper-local, while others are large, complex national intermediaries. What sets them apart from traditional financial institutions is a primary focus on providing tailored products and services designed to improve conditions for low-income, minority and other financially underserved people and places. CDFIs commonly serve as financial advisors for their customers, providing a range of assistance such as starting a banking relationship, securing financing, and saving for the future.  CDFIs have existed for generations, but took a major step forward in 1994 with the establishment of the US Treasury Departmentâ\\x80\\x99s CDFI Fund, which has certified more than 1,000 CDFIs across the nation.   Margaret Anadu: Bill, can you talk about who HOPE serves and how the crisis has impacted your community?   Bill Bynum: Over the past 26 years, HOPE has worked to reduce the extent to which race, gender and birthplace limit oneâ\\x80\\x99s economic potential, in total reaching over 1.5 million people across Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee. The pandemic has exacerbated this regionâ\\x80\\x99s long history of poverty and racial disparities. For example, in Mississippi, more than half of all households, and 70% of black households do not have savings to make ends meet.  Moreover, the Economic Policy Institute estimates that private sector losses in the Deep South will exceed the national average, driven by the disproportionately high number of leisure, hospitality, and retail jobs, which already pay far less than other industries in the region.  Without help, including the basic financial resources we provide, these already fragile families and their communities will struggle to survive.     Margaret Anadu: What were the biggest hurdles in getting Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) capital out and how did you overcome them?  Bill Bynum: The stresses and strains of implementing a mammoth new program in a short time left no one untouched, from the Small Business Administration and lenders, to the employers seeking assistance. One key lesson learned is the importance of clear, widely circulated guidance for small businesses. According to the National Minority Supplier Development Council, more than a third of minority businesses cited inadequate information or a lack of clarity as an impediment to the PPP application process. Potential borrowers received varying interpretations regarding their eligibility and forgiveness. Several PPP applicants to HOPE reported being left in limbo after other lenders prioritized existing and larger customers, set minimum loan amounts, or failed to notify them of their status. Smaller businesses and sole proprietors faced even bigger challenges, as many lacked ready access to the necessary records, or otherwise needed help navigating the application process. In response, HOPE collaborated with elected officials in New Orleans, Birmingham, Jackson and Montgomery, and nonprofit organizations across the South to mobilize a rapid response team that provided technical assistance to hundreds of PPP applicants. As a result, through May 11 HOPE had approved more than 1,000 PPP loans to small businesses, churches, private colleges and other vital employers across the Deep South.  Our median loan size is less than $12,000, and 75% are smaller than $25,000.   Margaret Anadu:  What more do you think needs to be done and whatâ\\x80\\x99s your view on how businesses in your community will be able to manage through the crisis?  Bill Bynum: While PPP has helped many employers, tens of thousands more are in need of a financial lifeline. This is particularly true for mom-and-pop businesses and nonprofits that provide critical services in low-income communities, and businesses owned by people of color. Traditional financial institutions often acknowledge that they are not always well structured to serve low-income markets. This is why CDFIs existâ\\x80\\x94to be the first responders in the financial system for underserved people and places.  And federal policymakers should follow suit by allocating funding that equips CDFIs to do what they do bestâ\\x80\\x94serve those who teeter on societyâ\\x80\\x99s financial edge.  Bold actions such as these would be a major step forward in building an economy that truly works for all Americans.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 05 May 2020  Public companies and investors have turned to private investments in public equity, or PIPEs, to raise capital at historically high levels given the uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. Goldman Sachs Investment Banking Divisionâ\\x80\\x99s Mike Voris and Evan Green discussed the appeal of the approach and why the trend has continued even as liquidity has returned to fixed income markets.  Mike, your team has been one of the busiest at the firm in recent weeks. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s driving the interest in PIPEs?  Mike Voris: The sharp increase in PIPE transactions coincided with the halt in capital markets funding over a month ago when the debt and equity markets were effectively closed to new issuance. In late March and early April, companies that would have issued bonds or convertibles to raise capital found themselves in a position where their access to capital was limited. Many drew down their lines of credit but as the need for capital intensified, they turned instead to the private markets.  With PIPEs, institutional investorsâ\\x80\\x94ranging from private equity funds, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds to family officesâ\\x80\\x94buy equity or equity-linked securities in a publicly traded company under a private transaction. The company gets much needed capital and, in some cases, valuable strategic input, while the investor gets a stake in the company at a discounted price for purchasing a less liquid security relative to a public financing. One thing thatâ\\x80\\x99s struck us in recent weeks is the level of interest weâ\\x80\\x99ve had from both investors and companies. Industry volumes for PIPEs typically average between $35 billion to $40 billion a year, but weâ\\x80\\x99re already running ahead of those levels with volumes increasing materially in recent weeks.  Activity in the private markets remains strong even though liquidity has returned to the fixed income markets. Why are companies continuing to pursue PIPEs?   Evan Green: In addition to capital, companies benefit from a â\\x80\\x9chalo effectâ\\x80\\x9d since a PIPE brings â\\x80\\x9csmart moneyâ\\x80\\x9d into the business. Private investors, often private equity sponsors, bring operational expertise as well as their networks and expense discipline to support the company in a complex period. We have also seen companies turn to PIPEs as a way to raise capital without having to increase their leverage, as they would otherwise have to do in the debt markets.  Mike Voris: Thereâ\\x80\\x99s also a tremendous amount of capital sitting on the sidelines that has built up in recent years as equity valuations increased. We estimate there is roughly $1.5 to $2 trillion in private capital across private equity, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and family offices. With the market dislocation, investors are now able to make investments at attractive levels and on investor-friendlier terms, which can include board seats while potentially generating attractive internal rates of return on capital invested.  What types of sectors are you seeing the most activity in and how are these investments typically structured?  Evan Green: Unlike the financial crisis where interest in PIPEs was primarily focused in the financial services sector, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing interest across a wider range of sectors, such as technology and media. The transactions themselves can range from common equity or equity-linked securities, such as convertible preferred equity, to securities that act more like debt instruments, such as convertible bonds or debt plus warrants. Many companies have shifted their focus to boosting liquidity while limiting dilution, so recent PIPEs have been structured on the debt-like side of the spectrum.  Issuers are utilizing the structural flexibility and tailored nature of PIPEs to match their specific needs. Given the broader macro uncertainty that is likely to persist in 2020, we expect PIPE financing activity to remain elevated.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 28 April 2020  Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Bentley de Beyer had just started in his position as the firmâ\\x80\\x99s Global Head of Human Capital Management when the coronavirus hit. In a recent conversation with Greg Wilson, Head of Institutional Client Businesses at the firmâ\\x80\\x99s Ayco financial counseling business, de Beyer spoke about his transition to the firm, the future of work and how he communicates with a global workforce during the crisis. What follows is an edited excerpt from their conversation.  Greg Wilson: Youâ\\x80\\x99ve had more than 20 years of experience in the human resources industry, most recently at Johnson & Johnson, before joining Goldman Sachs in January. Can you talk about what it was like to join the firm at an unprecedented time.  Bentley de Beyer: Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lived and worked in five different countries, which gave me unbelievable exposure to how different marketsâ\\x80\\x94notably the Asia Pacific regionâ\\x80\\x94handled exogenous shocks. Joining the firm at the start of crisis, meant it was especially important to be as transparent as possible with our people about the health of the business, our clients and the communities we serve. Weâ\\x80\\x99re managing through an extremely dynamic environmentâ\\x80\\x94which changes on an hour-to-hour basisâ\\x80\\x94where normal integration plans and playbooks are being thrown out.  Right now, weâ\\x80\\x99re very focused on how we can help employees and their families navigate their unique circumstances and pressing personal demands. In some cases, itâ\\x80\\x99s meant adjusting long-standing policies and practices, such as advancing 10 family care leave days, or recalibrating our learning and developing programs and offering wellness and resiliency programs to help our people stay physically and mentally robust. We learned a lot from our colleagues in Asia Pacific, who shared best practices on split teams, family accommodations and creating response plans.  Greg Wilson: How did your team adapt its approach to working and communicating with employees as the virus evolved from a regional issue to a global pandemic, and any lessons learned?  Bentley de Beyer: We sharply increased the intensity and frequency of our communications and, early on, made adjustments that may have been unpopular at the time but proved to be appropriate when the seriousness and intensity of the outbreak became more obvious.  Probably one of my biggest \"Aha\" moments was that for a large majority of our workforce this was their first large-scale crisis. Many havenâ\\x80\\x99t lived through a financial crisis or they had just entered the workforce. It was an important learning that there was a high level of anxiety among our population. So we really had to meet that head on and focus on our wellness response in a much more substantive way.  Our CEO David Solomon and our management committee have been connecting with people in real time and in a highly authentic and accessible way. Weâ\\x80\\x99re really trying to share weekly insights from our leaders and a lot of storytelling. For example, each week David holds either a virtual meeting with the firmâ\\x80\\x99s 400 partners or a virtual townhall open to everyone at the firm. Something Iâ\\x80\\x99ve learned from people at other great companies is that storytelling is incredibly powerful. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve shared a lot of the stories of how folks have gone the extra mile, people weâ\\x80\\x99ve supported temporarily stepping out of their day jobs because they have a healthcare background to go work at hospitals on full pay from us. There are hundreds of examples of these things around the world that weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen. Weâ\\x80\\x99re sharing them and it has built a strong spirit of togetherness and community amidst the challenges, particularly with 98% of our workforce working from home. From my perspective, that amplifies the need for connectivity, for elevating digital platforms, for looking at ways we can stay connected and create a sense of unity among our employees that we are all in this together.  Greg Wilson: Do you think the way we work will culturally evolve in the times ahead? Take, for example, work from home as a general practice versus a business continuity practice. Do you see less travel for meetings or more video conferencing?  Bentley de Beyer: I think the future of work is now. This is the largest global experiment on the future of work that I can ever imagine. Certainly not the way that any of us would have liked it to occur, but we can certainly learn a lot about flexible work, the capacity for folks to work in different locations, and be highly productive. I also think old adages such as, â\\x80\\x9cIf youâ\\x80\\x99re not sitting next to me, you canâ\\x80\\x99t be productive,â\\x80\\x9d or a lower level of trust with people working remotely, are being blown away based on how well large corporations around the world are finding their way through this. Itâ\\x80\\x99s going to be a fascinating time to be an HR practitioner over the next few years. I also think that instead of being a competitive advantage, flexible work will ultimately just be a base expectation for talent. The need for connectivity is still very high, whether thatâ\\x80\\x99s virtual or physical connectivity.  Greg Wilson: As you think of balancing the need for business and the need for being human, any advice that youâ\\x80\\x99d provide to client-facing teams?  Bentley de Beyer: The wordsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cHow are you doing?â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94are probably some of the best words to string together in a sentence on every phone call. It sounds so simple, yet weâ\\x80\\x99ve all been working at an intensive rate for many years that I think thereâ\\x80\\x99s this 15-second pause that is very powerful right now. Itâ\\x80\\x99s amazing how people will reach out and connect on that basis, even before what you need to do together or what particular issue you need to solve for. The power of just asking goes a very long way. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a moment of connection and caring.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 21 April 2020  The path to full economic recovery is likely to be complicated and gradual, as wide swaths of the economy are forced to rebuild and adapt. At a recent Forum discussion, Goldman Sachs Asset Managementâ\\x80\\x99s (GSAM) Katie Koch, co-head of the Fundamental Equity business, spoke with Steve Strongin, senior advisor at the firm and former head of Goldman Sachs Research, about the forward path.  Katie Koch: What is your view on the trajectory of the economic recovery?  Steve Strongin: Many people are focused right now on the macro path of the recovery, but from an investing and psychological perspective, it makes more sense to focus on the pattern of recovery. The halt in economic activity was sudden and broad, but the resumption in activity is likely to be gradual as different sectors of the economy resume at different stages. The initial recovery will be swift in the parts of the economy that are easier to restart, such as manufacturing. The transportation sector will bounce backâ\\x80\\x94albeit from record-low levelsâ\\x80\\x94although activity isnâ\\x80\\x99t likely to reach pre-crisis levels. Meanwhile, regions with less community virus spread are likely to reopen sooner than in places that have been hit hard. It will be easier, for example, for a restaurant in Chicago to open its doors than in New York City. In addition, the cities where restrictions were the greatest will see the sharpest rebound.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s likely that the overall level of output remains lower than pre-crisis levels for some time. Sectors hit hard by the pandemic, such as travel, leisure, lodging and restaurants, could see consolidation and new entrants, but whether they bounce back entirely will depend on medical advancements. Weâ\\x80\\x99re likely to see some permanent damage to servicers of small businesses, such as wholesalers and smaller shipping companies, while sectors benefiting from secular tailwinds, such as cloud computing and genomics, will accelerate once economies normalize.   Katie Koch: The pandemic is forcing an acceleration toward an e-world. How will those forces change the composition of the economy post-crisis?   Steve Strongin: Some sectors are going through structural changes and many of those changes will become permanent. Take-up rates of telemedicine, tele-banking and e-commerce have accelerated, particularly in rural areas and most notably beyond millennial populations. The video conferencing application, Zoom, has seen five years of digital adoption in the last two months, while online banking and e-learning have expanded at a similar pace. Acceleration in the uptake of telemedicine has been particularly evident in the 55+ age group as this population has more of an incentive to adopt this technology. Companies with employees working remotely have also been positively surprised by the stability in productivity. We expect this will lead to a friendlier attitude about work-from-home policies after the crisis which could, in turn, have a dramatic impact on reducing commuter traffic in congested cities, such as Chicago and Los Angeles. The real estate sector, however, is likely to become more complicated. Young people will still want to live in cities to be with other young people, while families with young children may find citiesâ\\x80\\x94due to a reduction in traffic congestionâ\\x80\\x94more livable.   Katie Koch: One of our investing themes is the impact that the Millennial generation has on sectors and industries. This is a generation that typically values experiences over products. Do you expect that to change?   Steve Strongin: Depending on the speed at which the economy recovers, itâ\\x80\\x99s more likely that the desire for experiences will only accelerate. For all the comparisons made with the Great Depression, it is worth remembering that the Spanish Flu of 1918 was followed by the roaring 1920s. These kind of events tend to result in situations where survivors want to live life to the fullest, without any regrets.  Katie Koch: We have been saying for a few months in GSAM that while monetary and fiscal responses are helpful, what the world really needs is a vaccine. What role do you think healthcare will play in this recovery?  Steve Strongin: We will see three threads of medical innovation: the development of a vaccine, late-stage treatments and an anti-viral treatment. The timing of each is uncertain for now, but itâ\\x80\\x99s important to keep in mind that there is a bias to finding late-stage treatments simply because they are easier to test than vaccines and anti-viral treatments. That said, there is a fair probability that we will have new ICU and anti-viral treatments by mid-summer and a vaccine by next spring. Each of these medical advancements changes the texture of the recovery. If the late-stage treatment isnâ\\x80\\x99t as frightening as getting intubated, then more people will be willing to take more risks. With the development of an anti-viral treatment, coronavirus essentially becomes another version of the seasonal flu. And if a vaccine is developed, then we will be living in a very different world.  Katie Koch:  In GSAM, our fundamental investors are students of the concept of â\\x80\\x9ccreative destructionâ\\x80\\x9d where innovations in products and businesses force established companies and businesses to either adapt or die. In one sense, economic downturns are capitalismâ\\x80\\x99s sorting mechanism, revealing weak business models and stretched balance sheets. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s your view on how the pandemic could reshape the economy?   Steve Strongin: A key legacy of this pandemic will be heightened innovation and greater collaboration in healthcare. The FDAâ\\x80\\x99s testing protocols are being viewed as too conservative so, as a result, weâ\\x80\\x99re likely to see testing regimes broaden and speed up. There may be a greater willingness to test treatments on healthy or moderately healthy populations as the testing regimes become more liberal. We may also see meaningful advances that relieve burdens on healthcare systems given increases in expenditure on basic healthcare infrastructure. Beyond healthcare, we should expect to see new business formations as long as there is a relaxation in the regulations that startups face. It is easier to start a business today than ever before because of enabling technologies such as AWS, Azure and Stripe. But even with government support, some businesses will not make it through the crisis.  More broadly, this crisis provides companies with an opportunity to rationalize, review existing practices and restart growth on a more sustainable path. Companies today are being judged by governments and society on their responses to this crisis. Companies are very aware of their social mission in terms of how they treat their employees and customers, while also engaging in efforts to aid the health response. A collapse in oil prices can pave way for cleaner energy providers with a structural advantage to gain market share. Meanwhile, high-cost, high pollutant producers, particularly in emerging markets, will be hard pressed to attract capital.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 14 April 2020  The face to-face meetings between investors and executives, often requiring week-long tours of major cities across the globe, are emblematic of the IPO process. But such in-person presentations may soon be giving way to virtual IPO roadshows in a travel-restricted landscape. We spoke with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Bill Chu, Sam Thong, James Wang and Darius Naraghi of the Investment Banking team in Hong Kong about the trends that are reshaping the IPO process in Asia.   Last month, you helped take China biotech firm InnoCare Pharma public during a time when much of the country was in lockdown. How did you manage that process?   Sam Thong: It was a time when everyoneâ\\x80\\x94clients, investors and ourselvesâ\\x80\\x94were adapting to a completely new situation. Given our prior work with the company, the management team was open to meeting prospective investors virtually, through phone calls and videoconferences. In a typical Hong Kong IPO roadshow, the management team would be traveling to the major cities in Asia, Europe and the US over the course of nine days to meet with potential investors. In the virtual format, we were able to schedule back-to-back meetings with investors, starting with Asia in the morning, moving to Europe mid-day and ending with East Coast investors at night. We used the time zones to our advantage. In doing so, we achieved a number of efficiencies. For example, we compressed the time of the road show itself from seven working days to 3.5 days. For us, that was critical because given the market volatility.  We wanted to limit the number of trading days that we would have to be in the market.    How comfortable are companies and investors with the virtual format?   Bill Chu: In early February, there was a lot of uncertainty, and many investors and clients wanted to limit their travel. As a result, they were very comfortable with the new format. In fact, we have found that the level of engagement, client calls and activity has picked up. From my perspective, the efficiency gains means that weâ\\x80\\x99re spending less time traveling and more time speaking with clients about market dynamics and their specific needs. For some of our clients, those conversations have focused on their liquidity needs, which has resulted in accelerated equity sales or increasing the size of their equity issuance. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve even kicked off some IPOs in the midst of the lockdown through video conferences.   How is the IPO process likely to change as a result of COVID-19?   James Wang: This might be the new norm for the new world. While the virtual IPO roadshow format worked well for InnoCareâ\\x80\\x94which I would describe as a medium-sized transaction for Hong Kong IPOsâ\\x80\\x94we have yet to see if a virtual format works for larger deals. Logistically, we set up multiple contingency plansâ\\x80\\x94having backup phone systems in different rooms, for exampleâ\\x80\\x94to ensure the investor meetings went as smoothly as possible. We considered every aspect of the deal structure to de-risk as much as possible, such as locking in cornerstone investors as early as possible.  How would you describe the broader outlook for deal activity in Asia at this time?  James Wang: If the market continues to be volatile, issuance volume is likely to be down compared with year-ago levels. However, since much of Asia has been in lockdown for longer than other parts of the world, we are seeing that companies are adjusting to the new normal and are returning to the markets. This is a type of market that is demand drivenâ\\x80\\x94that is, if issuers are flexible on price, theyâ\\x80\\x99re willing to push ahead with their plans to raise capital.   Darius Naraghi: Investors are in a similar situation to the rest of us. The interest from buyside investors hasnâ\\x80\\x99t dried up just because theyâ\\x80\\x99re working from home. We spent a lot of time working with our colleagues across divisions, legal, compliance and engineering, to figure out how to conduct due diligence on transactions in a context where people are unable to travel. The level of trust between the banks and investors is more critical in the virtual world than in the physical world. You have to have trust in the banks and the management team, whom you may have never met.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 07 April 2020  The technology sector was a strong outperformer during the bull market and, so far, is outperforming other sectors during the current downturn. At a recent Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) Forum event, Sung Cho and Greg Tuorto, portfolio managers on GSAMâ\\x80\\x99s Fundamental Equity team specializing in technology, and David Fischkoff on GSAM Fixed Incomeâ\\x80\\x99s credit team, shared their perspectives on why the sector is poised to weather the current crises.   The tech sector was one of the only categories that has seen inflows this year, amid strong client interest, and has held up relatively well during the sell-off. What are the dynamics at play?   Sung Cho: The big tech companies are likely to remain relatively unscathedâ\\x80\\x94and may even emerge stronger than everâ\\x80\\x94as they benefit from the work-from-home, play-at-home and deliver-to-home tailwinds. With millions of people sheltering in place, theyâ\\x80\\x99re deepening their reliance on services from the tech industryâ\\x80\\x99s largest companies. Meanwhile, the tech sector, which has already benefited by holding significant amount of net cash, is also seeing more of its revenues come from recurring sources. In software, for example, more than 80% of the subsectorsâ\\x80\\x99 revenues are recurring, up from about 60% in the financial crisis. In fact, itâ\\x80\\x99s likely that coming out of the crisis, we could see an acceleration of some of secular tailwinds that have already been underway, notably the adoption of the public cloud and further e-commerce penetration.  What subsectors of technology are likely to be most affected by changes in consumersâ\\x80\\x99 during this period  Greg Tuorto: Software will be critically important in the way we emerge from the downturn. Some companies, for example, are standardizing the way people are communicating. Other companies that support data centers, whose supply chains are intact, are relatively insulated from the downturn given that internet providers are expanding their data capacity daily to keep up with demand. To be sure, software companies wonâ\\x80\\x99t be entirely immune to a softening in demand and a drop in new business activity, but we expect customer turnover to remain low.  What are other potential headwinds due to lower consumer demand?  David Fischkoff: We expect that smartphone shipment volumes will be challenged due to weaker consumer demand, supply chain issues and challenging logistics given store closures. This ripples downstream to component suppliers such as semiconductor manufacturers. We are also cautious on the outlook for enterprise IT spendingâ\\x80\\x94as companies will be careful with spending for at least the balance of 2020â\\x80\\x94for server companies and, to a lesser extent, software-as-a-service companies. Instead, we believe companies with subscription-based models that have more resiliency in downturns, cloud-focused companies, and digital payments are better positioned.

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 31 March 2020  More than two months after imposing quarantines to battle the COVID-19 epidemic, China is on the economic road to recovery. Shao Ping Guan, head of the China Equity team and lead portfolio manager of Goldman Sachs Asset Managementâ\\x80\\x99s China Equity strategies, shared his thoughts on the countryâ\\x80\\x99s recovery and the resilience of its equity markets.  Shao Ping, youâ\\x80\\x99ve been investing in China for two decades and have been in Hong Kong throughout the crisis. What metrics are most material to informing your views on the resumption of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s economic recovery?  Shao Ping Guan: Many of the key indicators we look atâ\\x80\\x94such as the return of migrant workers, logistics activity and the rate of electricity and coal generationâ\\x80\\x94indicate that Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s manufacturing sector is operating at close to 80% of its normal capacity. In other words, industrial production has more or less normalized. However, the countryâ\\x80\\x99s urban traffic positionsâ\\x80\\x94which reflect the status of urban, commercial and consumer activitiesâ\\x80\\x94are only operating at about 65% of normal levels. That lag is not entirely unexpected given social distancing measures and the gradual removal of lockdown measures. For example, restaurants only started to open in the last two weeks while schools are expected to open by the end of March and early April.  Anecdotally, however, manufacturers have told us that while they were initially worried about whether they would be able to ramp up production to meet demand, theyâ\\x80\\x99re now worried about a drop in export orders, especially from Europe, in the second half of the year. And some of the larger, coastal cities are worried about a second wave of imported virus cases. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why we believe April will be a critical month for China. If the country gets through the month without major hiccups, calamities and cases, then one might optimistically expect that China could reach full domestic consumption by early May.   As China cautiously returns to work, what measures are in place to help the transition?  Shao Ping Guan: In recent weeks, the Chinese government implemented a range of measures to support the economy and the financial system. Key fiscal policies include tax cuts for small businesses and new infrastructure projects to boost growth. Meanwhile, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s central bank injected 1.2 trillion yuan into the financial system last month and lowered benchmark lending rates so banks can lend more to businesses. In addition, we expect changes in the approach towards structural issues, such as slowing the pace of de-leveraging, market-oriented reforms and implementation of environmental regulations. We believe efforts to further open the China A-shares market to foreign investors are on track and may even be accelerated.  To follow up, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s A-sharesâ\\x80\\x94or its local equitiesâ\\x80\\x94have recently outperformed global equity markets. What does that say about the resilience of the market or is there a lag?   Shao Ping Guan: Local Chinese equity markets are dominated by individual investors, millions of whom appear to be concluding that authorities are getting the virus under control. New local cases in China have largely declined while the markets are benefiting from improved liquidity. Prior to the virus outbreak, Chinese policymakers had already been easing and encouraging local governments to issue more bonds for infrastructure investment. And following the outbreak, the government also made liquidity abundant for capital markets to help cushion the impact of the outbreak.   Whatâ\\x80\\x99s your outlook for Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s growth?   Shao Ping Guan: While Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s domestic economy is stabilizing and normalizing, the external environment remains highly uncertain, given the negative implications for export demand and tourism. That said, we believe that China will not be a drag on global economic growth in second quarter, but rather a stabilizing force in the global economy, as domestic economic and corporate fundamentals sequentially improve.   How are you approaching the investment landscape?   Shao Ping Guan: Over the long term, we believe the three key investment opportunities in Chinese stocks remain structurally intactâ\\x80\\x94albeit with new risks and opportunities: the consolidation of â\\x80\\x9cold economyâ\\x80\\x9d sectors and the emergence of competitive national brands; the fusion of online-offline business models improving service sector productivity; and improvements in technology via innovation and market-oriented competition.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 24 March 2020  Even as the Federal Reserve announced plans to expand its bond-buying program, liquidity challenges in the fixed income markets have become another feature of the current crisis. Last week, Goldman Sachs Asset Managementâ\\x80\\x99s (GSAM) Mike Swell, co-head, Global Portfolio Management of Global Fixed Income, hosted a client call with members GSAMâ\\x80\\x99s Global Fixed Income team to discuss recent developments and the policy response.   Mike Swell: Ashish, can you provide an overview of the fixed income market, the steps being taken by the Federal Reserve toward recovery and what could drive valuations?   Ashish Shah: The combined shock of Covid-19 and drop in oil prices created a liquidity shock in fixed income. In short, the broad selloff in equities led to significant selling of fixed income securities. Much of this selling was driven by rebalancingâ\\x80\\x94investors selling fixed income and buying equities to rebalance their portfolios when the stock market sells offâ\\x80\\x94and by investors selling fixed income to raise liquidity. As a result, broker-dealer balance sheets have become clogged with securities, reducing their ability to intermediate between buyers and sellers in the bond market.  As central banks cut rates and expanded quantitative easing, we started to see liquidity improve, especially in Treasuries and agency mortgages. From an investment strategy perspective, weâ\\x80\\x99ve been focused on areas of the market that are in the path of policy response, and have been buying bonds that offer the potential for strong free cash flow backed by strong assets. Mortgage-backed securities are one example, as the Fed recently launched quantitative easing purchases of at least $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities. Weâ\\x80\\x99re very much in the thick of the crisisâ\\x80\\x94where we will likely remain over the next several weeksâ\\x80\\x94but expect to see opportunities in high-quality, short-term credit which will benefit from improving liquidity.  Mike Swell: The short-term commercial paper (CP) marketâ\\x80\\x94which companies tap to fund their day-to-day operationsâ\\x80\\x94began to show signs of strain when yields moved higher than certain long-dated bonds. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s usually an indication that companies are hoarding cash or that buyers are disappearing. But in recent days, the Fed introduced policies to help the CP market. Pat, what impact are these mechanisms having on the funding market?   Pat Oâ\\x80\\x99Callaghan: The Fed took a page from its 2008 financial crisis playbook by implementing initiatives that would backstop the $1.13 trillion market for commercial paper. One such measure included the launch of a Commercial Paper Funding Facility in which the Fed will buy three-month debt from firms with high credit ratings. And as we saw during the financial crisis, weâ\\x80\\x99re also seeing a similar rotation out of prime money market funds into government money market funds. For example, government money funds have picked up close to $300 billion of inflows while prime funds have seen outflows of $209 billion as of March 19. This time, however, the Fed also indicated that it will support firms that choose to use its capital and liquidity facilitiesâ\\x80\\x94which many were required to build up after the financial crisisâ\\x80\\x94as long as they deploy the capital in a â\\x80\\x9csafe and sound manner.â\\x80\\x9d For example, on March 26â\\x80\\x94the start of the next reserve maintenance periodâ\\x80\\x94the Fed will eliminate reserve requirements, effectively freeing banks to deploy all of their capital to support lending.   Mike Swell: Weâ\\x80\\x99ve obviously seen a lot of policy action in the US. Alex, can you share what youâ\\x80\\x99re seeing globally?   Alex Stiles: Central banks have already cut interest rates dramatically but appear to be out of room for further cuts. In Europe and Japan, where central bank policy rates are already negative, the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan both appear to have decided that cutting rates further into negative territory would be ineffective. We believe the Fed is also unlikely to adopt negative interest rates. That means fiscal is now in the spotlight. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve already seen the US announce large fiscal stimulus packages and expect to see more. In Germanyâ\\x80\\x94a country with a lot of fiscal firepowerâ\\x80\\x94weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen the finance minister describe his willingness to do whatever it takes to help German businesses, including a large-scale lending program to businesses. The UK also recently unveiled a large-scale government lending program that is estimated to cost 16% of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s GDP. But as we see similar policies being unveiled throughout Europe, we could see fiscal positions deteriorate far more rapidly than they did during the 2008 financial crisis. As a result, it will be important to monitor the interactions between fiscal and monetary policies.   Mike Swell: So far, the central bank policies appear to be aimed at the short-term funding and mortgage markets. But the credit markets are more in the eye of the storm when you consider the implications of an economic downturn. Ben, whatâ\\x80\\x99s your outlook for the sector?   Ben Johnson: In investment grade corporate bonds, we could see rating downgrades in sectors directly affected by the virus and lower oil prices, including companies in the energy, travel and leisure sectors. We believe the banking sector is well capitalized and well positioned to navigate near-term volatility. Based on our estimates, around $200-250 billion of BBB-rated bonds (the lowest investment-grade rating) could enter the high yield market over the coming year, equal to around 17% of the current US HY market value. We expect energy to account for around one half of these rating migrations, with the auto sector accounting for another one-third and the balance being comprised of issuers from travel and other sectors sensitive to the coronavirus.  Meanwhile, flows out of investment grade funds and ETFs continue to remain negative and we expect that to continue, especially as investors rebalance portfolios at month end. New issue activity is also modest, although we did see a pickup of high-quality companies, including Verizon, Bank of America and Progressive, issue bonds in recent days with attractive concessions.   Mike Swell: The investment grade sector has gotten hit harder than the high yield sector in part because itâ\\x80\\x99s more liquid. Yet there are plenty of companies with strong cash flow that will likely able to weather a recession. Any credit downgrades will certainly have an impact on high yield. Mike Dimitri, as global head of leveraged trading, can you tell us what youâ\\x80\\x99re seeing in your sector?   Mike Dimitri: As Ben mentioned, the potential for investment grade downgrades into high yield will put significant pressures on the sector. The spread widening that weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen in the last two weeks has taken us to spread levels that we last saw during the financial crisis. But while trading volumes are up 20% to 25% from the start of the year, the market has remained relatively orderly in the context of the widening spreads. The high yield market has experienced significant investor outflows, contributing to the liquidity challenges in this market. In high yield, we think default risk has increased, although we estimate the market is pricing in a 12-month default rate of about 9%, which is above our expectations.   For more, read GSAMâ\\x80\\x99s report, Taking the Temperature of the Bond Market           General Disclosures  All investments contain risk and may lose value.  Investments in fixed income securities are subject to the risks associated with debt securities generally, including credit, liquidity, interest rate, call and extension risk.  Although Treasuries are considered free from credit risk, they are subject to interest rate risk, which may cause the underlying value of the security to fluctuate. Below investment grade (high yield) bonds are more at risk of default and are subject to liquidity risk.  High-yield, lower-rated securities involve greater price volatility and present greater credit risks than higher-rated fixed income securities.  Income from municipal securities is generally free from federal taxes and state taxes for residents of the issuing state. While the interest income is tax-free, capital gains, if any, will be subject to taxes. Income for some investors may be subject to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 17 March 2020  As universities across the US, Europe and Asia cancel in-person classes in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, traditional classrooms are adopting virtual classroomsâ\\x80\\x94which could jumpstart the long-term adoption of remote learning. We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Adam Nordin, who covers the educational technology sector for the Investment Banking Division, who shared his thoughts on one of the fastest-growing segments in higher education.  As a growing number of schools and students turn to online learning, what is the impact for the sector?  Adam Nordin: COVID-19 could sharply accelerate the adoption of online learning in higher education. Historically, online learning in universities was largely a function of self-selection. At first, many institutions were apprehensive about introducing fully online classes, believing the experience would be substandard and learning outcomes would decline. Over time, however, technologies improved and students demanded a more integrated online experience to match their preferred methods of communicating. As a result, more schools opted for a hybrid approachâ\\x80\\x94either by enhancing the classroom experience with online learning or offering online courses that ran in parallel to the traditional campus experience and were managed by third parties. This is the first time many universities will have to rely on a fully online experience for their traditional undergraduate population. Doing so could dramatically accelerate the long-term acceptance of online learning.   How has the online learning market evolved?  Adam Nordin: With scarce bandwidth and rudimentary data compression, early online lessons typically lacked live, synchronous interactions. Still, these solutions enabled participants to transcend geography and shift time, opening up a significant market for working adults and others who could not accommodate a traditional campus experience. Today, online learning can offer live virtual classroomsâ\\x80\\x94aided by ample bandwidth and advanced cloud-base collaboration technologiesâ\\x80\\x94 that rival, or even exceed, an in-class experience. Since many students prefer the flexibility and feel of a technology-based experience, theyâ\\x80\\x99re pushing their institutions to embrace the modality. Future innovation through AR/VR will enable students in classrooms and in online settings to collaborate in virtual environments. Add in your own personal avatar and an interesting settingâ\\x80\\x94like learning about gravity while on the moonâ\\x80\\x94and you have an environment with dramatically amplified engagement and retention.  How are companies and investors approaching online learning and the edtech sector more broadly?  Adam Nordin: Weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen strong capital flows into this sector over the last three to five years. Not only are the edtech technologies more advanced, but the structural barriers to adoption are falling. Previously, investors looked at edtech as a niche industry. Today, investors are approaching edtech as an asset allocation category. Weâ\\x80\\x99re also seeing more interest from long-term investors, such as pensions and sovereign wealth funds, as well as family offices, all of whom appreciate the long-term secular drivers for the space.  Are there other drivers for a more virtual experience operating in parallel?  Adam Nordin:  First, younger students expect a more digital experience and are increasingly judging their university choices on this factor. Second, most colleges are under mounting fiscal strains, the result of 10 years of declining net tuition (after grants and scholarships). So capital efficient solutions that can accommodate students and drive incremental tuition revenues without requiring costly physical infrastructure are more valuable than ever. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not just the Provost that weighs in on the debate of online versus traditional higher educationâ\\x80\\x94the CFO and President are now involved. Finally, given that collaboration technologies in the corporate sector have also advanced significantly, weâ\\x80\\x99re likely to see higher education institutions adopt many of these enterprise-level technologies, in the same way we saw the healthcare industry adopt software and data analytics.  What technologies are increasing the efficacy of the online learning experience?  Adam Nordin: In short, data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence are enabling both students and teachers to gain a more customized and enriching experience. Learning assessments can detail precisely how, why and on what dimensions a student needs to focus to succeed. Professors hosting live-streaming classes have rich, personalized data that show each studentâ\\x80\\x99s entire performance profile, complete with their challenges and focus areas, enabling them to drive an individualized discussion with every student.  Is it possible for online learning to replace in-person classes?  Adam Nordin:  There will always be a place for the traditional campus experience, but online learning is here to stay. Remember that what we used to call the â\\x80\\x9cnon-traditional studentâ\\x80\\x9d (i.e., over 25 years old, a working adult, sometimes a single parent) is rapidly becoming the majority. As a result, we are also evolving how we use higher education to remain competitive. Learning will be a continuum, and technology will enable us to access it in smaller, more flexible and more relevant chunks.'},\n",

Remember that what we used to call the â\\x80\\x9cnon-traditional studentâ\\x80\\x9d (i.e., over 25 years old, a working adult, sometimes a single parent) is rapidly becoming the majority. As a result, we are also evolving how we use higher education to remain competitive. Learning will be a continuum, and technology will enable us to access it in smaller, more flexible and more relevant chunks.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 11 March 2020  When news of coronavirus first broke earlier in the year, Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Peter Oppenheimer warned that the markets were being too complacent. With the stock marketâ\\x80\\x99s latest plunge, we sat down with Peter to get his views on how severe the selloff could be and the key metrics and risks investors should watch.   Letâ\\x80\\x99s get straight to it: how long will this turbulence last? Are we heading into a bear market?  Peter Oppenheimer: Itâ\\x80\\x99s difficult to say with any certainty, given how much is still unknown about the spread of the virus and the lack of historical precedent. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve never before entered a bear market because of a viral outbreak. But if you believe we havenâ\\x80\\x99t hit the trough and we are in fact headed for bear territory, itâ\\x80\\x99s useful to look to the history of bear markets to get a sense of their duration and intensity. There are three different types, each with different triggers and characteristics: structural bear markets, cyclical bear markets and event-driven bear markets. At this stage, we think the balance is still in favour of this being an event-driven bear market, suggesting that the rebound in equity markets will be swift. On average, these kinds of bear markets triggered by exogenous shocks have seen declines of 29% and lasted nine months, with markets regaining their previous levels within 15 months.   But there are few precedents for the coronavirus. How does this factor into your analysis?  Peter Oppenheimer: Thatâ\\x80\\x99s right. It makes us more cautious, and there are three important caveats to make about intuiting anything from the history of event-driven bear markets. Firstly, none of the event-driven bear market examples from history were triggered by a virus or other disease outbreak. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re all different but typically it has been market driven, so a monetary response has often been more effective, whereas this time itâ\\x80\\x99s not clear that it will be. This is partly because interest rate cuts may not be very effective in an environment of fear where consumers are forced, or just inclined, to stay at home. Secondly, none of the previous examples were in periods where the starting point of interest rates has been so low. This could raise the concern in markets that there is less room for an effective policy response. And thirdly, in previous periods when there have been viral shocks, such as SARS, the equity markets tended to rebound when the growth in infections slowed. While this may be true in China, itâ\\x80\\x99s clearly not true in many other parts of the world, so the fear factor around the economic shock from preventative measures may push markets further down in the meantime.  Beyond monitoring the spread of the virus, what are the other key metrics to watch?  Peter Oppenheimer: We have two proprietary indicators that we are watching closely for signs that markets are approaching a buying point, particularly for longer-term investors. Our Global Risk Appetite Indicator has fallen below -2, a level which historically has indicated above-average S&P 500 returns over the next 12 months. In the depths of the global financial crisis this measure dropped to -2.96 before recovering, so to cap downside risks in the near-term, you usually require a perceived shift in growth momentum and/or policy response.   The other measure weâ\\x80\\x99re watching is our Global Bull/Bear Market Indicator. This is based off an assessment of six major factors. Encouragingly, the recent measures have come down from the peak levels that weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen. This both suggests less room for downside risk and higher likelihood of stronger, longer-term returns. That said, the factors underlying this model are showing conflicting signals at present. Generally low unemployment, a flat yield curve and a high valuation are all pointing to vulnerability. On the other hand, low core inflation, a depressed level of growth momentum and strong private sector balances are a structural support for the markets.  Are there any other risks to be wary of?  Peter Oppenheimer: Credit markets will be in sharp focus in the coming days and weeks. With the collapse in oil prices, the risks in the high yield credit market increase. And the growing risks of a global recessionâ\\x80\\x94or even the risks that this is priced as a likely scenarioâ\\x80\\x94make credit look vulnerable. All of these things increase the risk that any event-driven shock will morph into a more entrenched cyclical bear market as investors price the probability of sharp falls in corporate profits into a recession. However, given other supportsâ\\x80\\x94including ultra-low interest rates and a relatively healthy private sector balanceâ\\x80\\x94our assumption is that any event-driven bear market will be associated with a swift recovery.

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 03 March 2020  Raghuram Rajan, former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s former central banker, shared his views on monetary policies, the risk of global supply chains and the importance of communities in a wide-ranging conversation with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Katie Koch, co-head of Goldman Sachs Asset Managementâ\\x80\\x99s (GSAM) Fundamental Equity business, at a GSAM Forum event in New York. What follows are excerpts from their conversation.   Katie Koch: Letâ\\x80\\x99s start off with the global perspective: Where do you think we are in the economic cycle and how much further you think we have to go in the US?   Raghuram Rajan: What is interesting is that we have a global economy which continues to be chugging along at a mediocre paceâ\\x80\\x94neither too hot nor too coldâ\\x80\\x94which doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have enough momentum to take off but is not so bad that it plunges into a recession either. And ifâ\\x80\\x94and this is a big ifâ\\x80\\x94coronavirus is contained, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no reason why we wonâ\\x80\\x99t see this continue for some time. Of course, monetary tightening is one of the factors that could disrupt this process, but central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have indicated that further tightening is off the table for now.   Katie Koch: If the central banks are preferring to run economies â\\x80\\x9chot,â\\x80\\x9d why have we seen so little inflationâ\\x80\\x94despite relatively tight labor markets?   Raghuram Rajan: If you talk to business owners today, they will tell you they canâ\\x80\\x99t find people to hire even though theyâ\\x80\\x99re willing to pay more. One possibilityâ\\x80\\x94which weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen in Japanâ\\x80\\x94is that with an aging population, youâ\\x80\\x99ll have older employees retiring and younger people moving in. So while companies may be paying the new people higher wages, the average wage bill wonâ\\x80\\x99t be increasing as much given that the experienced, more expensive, employees have moved on. The other comparable period where we had low inflation and tight labor markets was in the mid-1960s. At the time, we had similar conditions before inflation suddenly took off. Inflation will reassert itself at some point, but I think we have some room.   Katie Koch: Given your experiences at the IMF and at Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s central bank, what do you make of the rising populism around the world and whether that could be a potential constraint on growth and trade?  Raghuram Rajan: If you notice where the protests are taking place, theyâ\\x80\\x99re in the areas where the populations havenâ\\x80\\x99t benefited as much from globalization, technology improvements and trade. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s creating internal frictions and weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing the type of policy paralysis that we have in Washington today being replicated across other countries. And when you have internal policy paralysis, you donâ\\x80\\x99t have strong growth. At the same time, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing renewed focus on the efficiency and risk exposures of global supply chains. So when you have a problem in Chinaâ\\x80\\x94such as coronavirus disrupting global supply chainsâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99re going to see a pulling back on trade and potentially some re-shoring of manufacturing jobs.   Katie Koch: On monetary policy, how do you feel about the credibility of central banks and their ability to get us out of the next recession?  Raghuram Rajan: A lot of monetary policy works through changing peopleâ\\x80\\x99s expectations in the direction that you want. And in the real world, one of the hardest things to do is to change peopleâ\\x80\\x99s expectations. My sense is that we donâ\\x80\\x99t have a strong sense of how to do that. Consider Japan, which is the first country to deal seriously with the problem of an aging population. The country has been at the forefront of inventing new monetary policy tools to boost growth, but these tools have had a very modest impact. Although central banks still have some room â\\x80\\x94by restarting quantitative easing, for exampleâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t think thereâ\\x80\\x99s a huge amount.  Katie Koch: Letâ\\x80\\x99s pivot to India. Prime Minister Modi has committed to reaching a $5 trillion GDP by 2024. If we were to extrapolate that from where we are now, that assumes Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s economic growth would have to nearly double in real terms from where we are today. How will India get there?     Raghuram Rajan: Weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing a bit of a cyclical pickup in India but I doubt weâ\\x80\\x99re going to get anywhere near the growth rates that are required without serious reform. And unfortunately, weâ\\x80\\x99re just tinkering at the margin. The most serious problem right now is in the financial sector, which needs to be cleaned up so that it has a chance to move higher. But there was very little discussion in Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s recently released budget of what needs to be done. Budgets are an occasion where Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s government can provide its vision for the economy and to show a sense of urgency. But I didnâ\\x80\\x99t really see that vision and urgency reflected in the latest release.   Katie Koch: Youâ\\x80\\x99ve recently published a book called The Third Pillar which talks about the role of the market and state in modern society, and why we need to include the â\\x80\\x9cthird pillarâ\\x80\\x9d of community into that discussion. Why does community matter so much?  Raghuram Rajan: Throughout much of the 20th century, the debate was about markets versus governmentâ\\x80\\x94some people wanted more government intervention and some people wanted less. But that discussion misses out on the tremendous role the community played in preparing people for the markets. Youâ\\x80\\x99re essentially born into a family that teaches you values. You go to a school where youâ\\x80\\x99re surrounded by friends and neighbors. And what we increasingly see is that where youâ\\x80\\x99re born and where you grow up makes a huge difference in your lifetime earnings. And I think the missing piece is that we need to fix communities at the local level. Unless you have a healthier communityâ\\x80\\x94with a greater sense of purposeâ\\x80\\x94job activity disappears, resulting a breakdown of the social fabric. This is a pattern that is replicating itself now in predominantly white communities where the largest employer leaves town. Jobs are lost, marriages fall apart, teenage pregnancies increase and drugs and alcohol move in. The opioid epidemic is, in a sense, a reflection of this hopelessness.  More broadly, from a global perspective, youâ\\x80\\x99ve seen power move from the local communities, to the national and then to the global levels. If you think about Brexitâ\\x80\\x99s rallying cry it was to take back control, not just from Brussels to London, but from London to Manchester and then from Manchester to the local governments. That process will start to reassert itself. In order to preserve the globalization of trade, we should look to reverse the globalization of governance and to bring it back to communities. Because without people feeling a sense of control, theyâ\\x80\\x99re not going to support the globalization of trade.

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 25 February 2020  The hospitals and healthcare systems that are critical to managing our health are also, with more than $1 trillion in investments, a significant part of the institutional investor landscape. We sat down with Paget MacColl of Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM), which recently released the results of its Healthcare Diagnostic, an annual survey assessing the investment approaches and practices of the nationâ\\x80\\x99s largest nonprofit healthcare systems and hospitals. In our interview, Paget discussed the role of investments amid an increasingly challenging operating environment.  Can you describe the landscape facing healthcare organizations? What are some of the concerns youâ\\x80\\x99re hearing from clients?  Paget MacColl: Hospitals and nonprofit healthcare systemsâ\\x80\\x94which happen to be the largest employers in 16 states across the USâ\\x80\\x94are in the midst of a rapidly changing and dynamic landscape. Many are facing pressures on operating margins amid rising labor and pharmaceutical costs, while dealing with disruption from new entrants outside of traditional healthcare. For example, Amazon, J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway have teamed up to create Haven, a new healthcare provider for their employees, while Apple, which is leveraging its Apple Watch into an always-on diagnostic tool, may have bigger plans in the healthcare industry. CVS Healthâ\\x80\\x99s acquisition of Aetna will also bring more pressure on costs. Meanwhile, consolidation is forcing hospitals and healthcare systems to invest in technology to achieve scale and efficiencies in order to compete, even as they continue to invest in innovation to find new revenue streams. In 2019, for example, there were 92 M&A transactions, in which 80% of deals involved a nonprofit health system as the acquirer.  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s unique about this sector compared with corporates, pensions or public plans?   Paget MacColl: Hospitals and healthcare systems rely more heavily on their investment portfolios to fund growth than corporate and public plansâ\\x80\\x94in fact, income from their investments can often be multiples of their operating income. Consider the Cleveland Clinic, one of the nationâ\\x80\\x99s most prominent hospital chains. In 2017, the Cleveland Clinic posted investment income of $953 million, which was nearly three times the size of its operating income that year. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centerâ\\x80\\x94one of the largest and oldest private cancer centers in the worldâ\\x80\\x94has also consistently posted investment income far greater than its operating income. Given the uncertainty in the healthcare industry, hospitals and healthcare systems have ramped up their focus on investment contributions as a means to shore up their financial strength.  If investments are so critical to the organizational strategies for hospitals and healthcare organizations, how are they managing their money?  Paget MacColl: Based on the findings from our Healthcare Investment Diagnosticâ\\x80\\x94which surveyed hospitals and healthcare systems representing over $300 billion investmentsâ\\x80\\x94many are increasing (or planning to increase) their allocations to private equity and private real estate, while decreasing their exposure to hedge funds, which have underperformed. In general, the larger the organization, the greater the planned allocations. And we expect those numbers to increase since the vast majority of mergers typically results in a change in investment strategies. More broadly, weâ\\x80\\x99re also seeing a growing number of healthcare systems develop and invest in captive healthcare innovation programs. These programs, which are more prevalent in organizations with more than $5 billion in cash, seek to deploy capital to investments, technology and research that could help reduce costs, incubate new ideas or find efficiencies.

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 18 February 2020  With record levels of cash, private equity firms appear poised for another solid year. We recently sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Pete Lyon, who runs the firmâ\\x80\\x99s global sponsors franchise, to discuss his outlook for the private equity industry this year.   Pete, you recently rejoined the Financial and Strategic Investors Group, which works with large private equity firms and an increasingly diverse set of investors (also known as financial sponsors) looking to invest in the private markets. How would you describe the state of the private equity industry today?   Pete Lyon: Investors are continuing to allocate money into the private equity and credit markets and broader alternative asset classes as they seek out returns that can outpace those in the public markets on a risk adjusted basis. Buyout fundraising both globally and in North America hit record highs in 2019 at $371 billion and $263 billion, respectively, according to PitchBook. While valuations are elevated, sponsor-related M&A activity is still strongâ\\x80\\x94though down in 2019 from record 2018 levelsâ\\x80\\x94as buyers compete for high-quality assets in a competitive market. In particular, large deals are dominating global activity while sponsors are turning to the public markets to source investment opportunities. The number of take-privates, for example, was up 25% in 2019 versus 2018.  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s driving the growth in the industry?   Pete Lyon: There are a number of secular tailwinds that are fueling the importance of private markets. For one, companies are staying private longer, given the access to capital and the ability to grow their business out of the public spotlight. At the same time, more regions and other asset classes, such as credit, are opening up to private capital flow. Weâ\\x80\\x99re also seeing emerging buyersâ\\x80\\x94such as sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, family offices, and energy funds, among othersâ\\x80\\x94investing in the private markets for higher returns.  What are some of the top client concerns?  Pete Lyon: After last yearâ\\x80\\x99s fundraising records, financial sponsors are sitting on a record amount of uninvested capital. As a result, many are facing pressure by their capital sources to deploy that capital. The dichotomy we are paying close attention to this year is that pressure in context of the upcoming U.S. presidential election and concerns of a possible slowing in global economic activity. On balance, most investors want to be in and out of the market before the start of the Democratic and Republican conventions this summer, as they weigh the risk of political uncertainty and volatility later in the year. And while â\\x80\\x9clate cycleâ\\x80\\x9d concerns seem to have subsided as the risk of a 2020 recession remains low, many sponsors are working with their management teams to lay the groundwork preparation in their portfolios for an eventual global recession.  What does 2020 bring for the private equity industry?   Pete Lyon: So far we are seeing healthy deal flow, and early data shows no signs of a slowdown in fundraising. We saw a lot of pitch activity in January and toward the end of 2019, which is fueling the M&A pipeline at a time when conditions for the financing markets are more attractive now than late last year. We expect to see continued competition for high-quality companies, and the IPO market is open for private companies with proven business models that can generate sustainable, profitable growth. For our part, weâ\\x80\\x99re working with financial sponsors to find more ways to generate returns and provide liquidity through, for example, the sale of a minority stake or by rolling over assets into a new (â\\x80\\x9ccontinuationâ\\x80\\x9d) fund. Additionally, sponsors are evaluating ways to improve their investments, whether it is through add-on deals or â\\x80\\x9cbuy-and-buildâ\\x80\\x9d acquisitionsâ\\x80\\x94a strategy used by firms to synergistically merge companies in the same sector before selling the larger company at a later date. We continue to leverage our expertise across products, markets, sectors, and disciplines to deliver the firm to this important and growing client base.'},\n",

We sat down with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s India Chief Economist Prachi Mishra who shared her views on the budget announcement.  Prachi, what made the budget announcement so important this year, in your view? What were the key issues that policymakers were trying to address?  Prachi Mishra: Last year was a difficult year for the Indian economy, which slowed significantly and sharply. Several market participants, for example, were predicting that India was on an inescapable path toward a hard landing. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why there was heightened anticipation about this yearâ\\x80\\x99s Indian budget. For their part, Indian policymakers had to perform a difficult balancing act between providing a stimulus to boost growthâ\\x80\\x94with very little fiscal flexibilityâ\\x80\\x94against a backdrop of high fiscal deficits, falling gross domestic product growth and rising unemployment.   What are the key takeaways from the budget plan?   Prachi Mishra: While the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s $428 billion budget lacked a large-scale stimulus program like those we saw in budgets released during the global financial crisis, it outlined a series of measures designed to increase consumption and investment, including a cut in income tax rates, a spending boost to infrastructure and the rural economy, and an increase in bond limits for foreign investors. In our view, it appears policymakers took a calculated risk by maintaining a path to reduce the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s deficits while at the same time proposing an ambitious spending program.  The success of this balancing act will largely depend on one key factor: the execution of the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s large-scale privatization plan. The government said it would sell stakes in state-owned companies, including one of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s largest insurance companies, with the goal of raising 9% of its gross revenues next year from asset sales. The budgeted increase in asset sales can help balance the twin objectives of macroeconomic stability and growth, but whether or not the government can hit its target is a key concern, given it missed its less ambitious goals last year. What the markets are looking for in the coming weeks is a credible program with greater details, along with concrete steps and timelines so they can have more confidence in the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s privatization plans.  What is your outlook for growth this year?   Prachi Mishra: The big challenges for the Indian economy continue to be weak private investment, muted monetary transmission and low direct and indirect tax collections. However, we expect the slowdown that began in January 2018 to end soon in response to moderately better global growth, easier domestic financial conditions, increased government spending, improving sentiment and an easing of supply bottlenecks. The main risk to our 2020 and 2021 India outlook is the continued risk aversion and lack of confidence in the domestic financial sector, in addition to global risks.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 04 February 2020  As investor focus on infrastructure continues to expand, so too has its scope, according to Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Brian Bolster and Michael Sachs, who lead the firmâ\\x80\\x99s investment banking coverage effort for the sector. We sat down with Brian and Michael who shared their views on infrastructureâ\\x80\\x99s evolution  To set the stage, how do you define infrastructure and what are you seeing in the space?    Brian Bolster: The definition is evolving. Historically, the infrastructure asset class has been associated with bridges, toll roads, ports and other â\\x80\\x9chardâ\\x80\\x9d assets that produce consistent, low-risk dividends to investors because of the essential nature of the asset. In recent years, as demand has outstripped the supply of attractive projects to invest in, investors have tried to identify other asset classes that retain some of the core elements of public infrastructure. In doing so, they expanded the traditional definition of infrastructure. Therefore, we have seen investors moving into other infrastructure-like investmentsâ\\x80\\x94such as data centers, energy infrastructure, pipelines and renewable projects.   Michael Sachs: Investors are looking to find assets that resemble core infrastructureâ\\x80\\x94that is, hard assets that provide long-term, stable cash flows and which typically have a low correlation to other asset classes. Like traditional infrastructure, these assets are capital intensive and have high barriers to entry, making it hard for other companies to compete.  Can you expand a little more on how the supply-and-demand dynamic for investors evolved in recent years?   Brian Bolster: One of the biggest changes is the amount of capital available to be deployed. Investors raised $97 billion last year and a record $104 billion in total equity in 2018. Not only are infrastructure funds exceeding their fundraising targetsâ\\x80\\x94leading many to close at a rapid paceâ\\x80\\x94but mega funds (typically funds larger than $5 billion in assets) are also increasingly dominating the landscape. In 2019, for example, investors raised the largest-ever fund at $22 billion, with additional mega funds looking to close in 2020. The trend toward ultra-large funds changes the scale of the potential investable universe and also creates a new dynamic in the competition for assets.  Michael Sachs: One of the challenges facing investors is that the supply of attractive projects hasnâ\\x80\\x99t kept pace with demand. Core investment opportunities across Europe and Australia have largely been identified, while projects in North America have remained mired in red tape. Late last year, for example, St. Louis, Mo., pulled the plug on a multi-year-long effort to privatize its Lambert airport. With all of this capital flowing into the sectorâ\\x80\\x94indeed, thereâ\\x80\\x99s an estimated $200 billion of dry powder from infrastructure funds waiting to be deployedâ\\x80\\x94funds are looking outside of traditional infrastructure to non-transport-related sectors. We have been part of this migration, having recently advised renewable power firm Pattern Energy on its sale to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. We also served as advisor to Macquarie Infrastructure Partners on its acquisition of Netrality Data Centers, among others in this space.  How has this evolution changed the industry?   Brian Bolster: First, you really have to be able to look across a lot of different industries to examine all the possibilities. Second, we have seen a stratification within â\\x80\\x9cinfrastructure.â\\x80\\x9d  Investors are also looking at different risk profiles. Generally, core infrastructure is used to describe traditional infrastructure: airports, bridges, tunnels and roads. Core-plus encompass the broader definition of infrastructure-like assets which typically offer higher returnsâ\\x80\\x94but with higher risks. At the other end of the spectrum is the super-core category, which is considered the most conservative category of infrastructure (typically utilities and water assets) which generate levered returns in the mid- to high-single digits. Funds are generally looking to target assets which fit into one of these categories.    How are infrastructure investors approaching these non-traditional sectors?   Brian Bolster: Essentially what weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen is a recognition that the characteristics that make core transport assets attractive are not limited to transport. Take, for example, a company called Restaurant Technologies. This is a business that supplies and disposes of cooking oil for restaurants and other food-service operations, and counts McDonalds as a key customer. By building and investing in infrastructure around the country to support the delivery and removal of cooking oil, the company has infrastructure-like characteristicsâ\\x80\\x94an extensive installed base and strong recurring cash flow underpinned by long-term contractsâ\\x80\\x94that has attracted infrastructure capital (Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Merchant Banking Division made an investment in the company in 2018). The company also has a competitive advantage because it would be very difficult to replicate its existing market position.  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the outlook for M&A in the sector?   Michael Sachs: We expect to see more M&A opportunities, given the expanding definition of infrastructure and the large amount of capital infrastructure funds are looking to deploy. And with the larger amounts being deployed, the deal sizes are also getting larger.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 28 January 2020  Last week, leaders from the public and private sectors convened in Davos, Switzerland for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. Three members of the firmâ\\x80\\x99s delegation â\\x80\\x93 Gregg Lemkau and Dina Powell of the Investment Banking Division, and Sheila Patel of the Consumer and Investment Management Division â\\x80\\x93 share their takeaways from the weekâ\\x80\\x99s events.  Davos always means dozens of meetings, events and panel discussions. What were the dominant themes of the week?  Gregg Lemkau: Discussion about climate change reigned supreme this year. The topic of ESG has been part of nearly every discussion we have had as a firm with companies, boards and investors in the past year, and Davos only confirmed further that itâ\\x80\\x99s going to remain top of mind for the business community for the foreseeable future.  Dina Powell: At Davos, there was a particular focus on areas where the public and private sector can partner to make meaningful progress on some of these core issues like climate, inequality and diversity among leadership teams.    Sheila Patel: Sustainabilityâ\\x80\\x94but not everyone agreed on what that means. Our efforts as a firm to put a frame around this, led by David Solomonâ\\x80\\x99s Financial Times op-ed, the firmâ\\x80\\x99s sustainability report, and our focus on key issues like climate change and inclusive growth tapped into the key concerns all stakeholders share.   Goldman Sachs made some news of its own during the event with an announcement of a new commitment on board diversity for our IPO clients. How does that fit into some of the dialogue around ESG?   Sheila Patel: One of the surprising things to me about the sustainability discussion today is how many people are still thinking of ESG as purely about \"doing good.\" Itâ\\x80\\x99s clear to us at Goldman Sachs that driving global growthâ\\x80\\x94and broad participation in that growthâ\\x80\\x94is absolutely critical to the long-term prospects of any organization. We have a unique opportunity at the firm to make the connections apparent and actionable, given the many different ways in which we work with clients.  Gregg Lemkau: To Sheilaâ\\x80\\x99s point, the business case was front and center in making this announcement. Our decision to only underwrite the IPOs of private companies with at least one diverse board director, increasing to two in 2021, is rooted in our conviction that companies with diverse leadership perform better from an economic and returns standpoint. Itâ\\x80\\x99s simply the best advice for any company preparing to go public, with all the responsibilities that entails. But in addition to the real commercial benefits, itâ\\x80\\x99s clear that changing the stereotypes associated with corporate decision-making will have many positive effects for society as a whole.  Where does the dialogue go from here?  Sheila Patel: We need more examples of how to be part of the change that we want to seeâ\\x80\\x94 sustainability in action. Our efforts to vote our proxies in Goldman Sachs Asset Management to align with our principlesâ\\x80\\x94such as diversity on boards and climate changeâ\\x80\\x94and the firmâ\\x80\\x99s new IPO policy regarding board diversity are some examples of the â\\x80\\x9cpurpose-driven actionsâ\\x80\\x9d we need to see coming from global forums such as Davos.   Dina Powell: I imagine that discussions on the topic of diversity in corporate governance will become even more prominent. As David mentioned in his announcement, over the past four years, US companies that have gone public with at least one woman board director outperformed companies that do not, one year post-IPO. Because itâ\\x80\\x99s sound business, I think this movement will ultimately drive significant change in the standards to which companies are held.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 21 January 2020  European regulators are exploring a new, more rigorous method of evaluating a vehicleâ\\x80\\x99s environmental impact. The so-called Life Cycle Assessment approach would broaden the scope of evaluation to include the entire life cycle of a car â\\x80\\x93 not just its on-road emissions. We sit down with Kota Yuzawa of Goldman Sachs Research to discuss the shiftâ\\x80\\x99s implications for the future of electric vehicles, as well as investors who have a stake in the space.   How do we currently evaluate a vehicleâ\\x80\\x99s environmental impact? Why and how are regulators looking to change the existing approach?  Kota Yuzawa: The current method considers only the CO2 emitted while the vehicleâ\\x80\\x99s engine is running. But thatâ\\x80\\x99s just one part of a bigger picture and may not be a fair representation of a carâ\\x80\\x99s full impact on the environment. With this in mind, European regulators are encouraging life cycle assessment, or what they call LCA standards, to be adopted no later than 2023. Under LCA, a carâ\\x80\\x99s environmental footprint would consist of the emissions produced across the entire lifespan of the vehicle, including the manufacturing, fuel sourcing and scrapping processes.  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the difference in the numbers when we compare the two methods?  KY: There is a greater difference than most would expect. With the current method, an EV is a zero-CO2 emissions vehicleâ\\x80\\x94as good as it gets. But if we use LCA standards, that number rises to 100-120 grams of CO2 emitted per kilometer. For context, the average sedan powered by an internal combustion engine generates 120g/km of CO2 emissions under current evaluation standards. Under LCA standards, that number increases to 170-180g/kmâ\\x80\\x94an increase of just 50-60g versus the more significant rise of 100-120g/km for an EV.                                                                                                                                                                                  Which part of the EV life cycle is driving this increase in emissions?  KY: Itâ\\x80\\x99s the production phase. In fact, the amount of CO2 emitted during the production of an electric vehicle is twice the amount emitted during the production of a vehicle with an internal combustion engine. The disparity stems from CO2 emissions related to battery production. If battery performance improvesâ\\x80\\x94which it should in the long runâ\\x80\\x94EVs will become clearly superior to traditional vehicles, even on an LCA basis.  Under LCA standards, how does the environmental impact of EVs vary across regions?  KY: The total CO2 emissions of an EV over its full life cycle vary significantly depending on the sources of power used in the region where the vehicle is manufactured and driven. For instance, batteries made in Asia have a greater CO2 footprint than ones made in the US and Europe. In Europe, where clean energy sources are relatively widespread, EVs still compare favorably with other types of vehicles if CO2 emissions are measured using the LCA method. In Japan, China and other markets outside Europe where fossil fuels are still widely used, they compare less favorably.  The LCA is a European initiative. Should global investors care?  KY:Most countries with major automotive markets have signed the Paris Agreement on climate change, so the LCA proposal will have global reach. LCA could constrain automakersâ\\x80\\x99 ability to address customer demand for longer-haul EVs given the environmental impact of the larger batteries needed to produce them, barring advances in battery technology. Suppliers with energy sources in regions that derive a higher percentage of electricity from renewables will have an advantage over those in regions more dependent on fossil fuels. Finally, the new method may drive consolidation in the auto industry as larger, global players will be better positioned in an LCA era.

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 14 January 2020  At Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 inaugural Philanthropy Forum, recently hosted by the firmâ\\x80\\x99s Private Wealth Management business, more than 350 clients convened in New York to hear perspectives from notable philanthropists and learn strategies for maximizing giving and measuring impact. Dr. Deepak Chopra, a pioneer in integrative medicine and personal transformation, spoke about the power of philanthropy with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Meena Flynn. Edited highlights from their conversation are featured below.  Meena Flynn: One of the biggest challenges in the philanthropic community is the ability for donors to measure and evaluate the impact of their contributions. Deepak, youâ\\x80\\x99ve often made the case that in addition to measuring the effectiveness of philanthropy, you can also measure the happiness that one derives from the act of giving. What do you mean by that?   Deepak Chopra: One can boil down the ingredients to happiness to three things. About half of our happiness can be determined by what we call the â\\x80\\x9cset pointâ\\x80\\x9d in our brain for determining happiness or unhappiness. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s basically attitude: Do you see problems or opportunities? The other components of determining happiness include conditions of living, such as financial conditions, and our voluntary actions, or the choices we make every day. With our choices, we basically make two types of choices every day. We make choices for personal pleasure, such as shopping or going to the movies, but these choices are short-lived. The second type of choice encompasses the ability to make other people happy. This is where concepts such as appreciation and philanthropy fit in. The fastest way to be happy is to make another person happy. Every individual has the power to overcome their genetic dispositions and other conditions of living, while the choices we make can also lead to greater happiness.   Meena Flynn: What have you learned through your philanthropic efforts that can help philanthropists maximize their impact?   Deepak Chopra: When you work with a lot of nonprofits, which Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done over the years, you end up finding out that even the nonprofits are competing with each other. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re afraid of each otherâ\\x80\\x99s successes and are often competitive with other founders. That interferes with a lot of good work, often because egos get in the way of service and passion. So in philanthropy, itâ\\x80\\x99s important to find out what the nonprofit leaderâ\\x80\\x99s personal passion is â\\x80\\x93 thereâ\\x80\\x99s usually a story behind it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s important to work with nonprofits run by leaders with a personal stake in its mission, something that clearly feeds his or her passion and vision for the organization. Then you have to connect them with other people like them, who complement their strengths to achieve specific goals. Find out their personal passion and story and then connect them with other people like them.    Meena Flynn: What makes a leader charismatic and how do you define charisma?   Deepak Chopra: To me, the most charismatic leaders have three qualities. For one, theyâ\\x80\\x99re present, not distracted. Second, they have humility; no one is beneath them. And third, at least to their audience, theyâ\\x80\\x99re extremely friendly. If you think about it, the most effective leaders are also charismatic. People want to be around them and be part of their teams.   Meena Flynn: Youâ\\x80\\x99ve accomplished a lot. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s your mission now?   Deepak Chopra: I believe that Iâ\\x80\\x99m in the most productive years of my life. I come from a tradition where, in the first 25 years of life, people are focused on creating as much knowledge and education for yourself. In the second 25 years, youâ\\x80\\x99re pursuing fame, fortune and success. In the third 25 years of life â\\x80\\x93 which is what Iâ\\x80\\x99m in â\\x80\\x93 you give back. And in the last 25 years of life â\\x80\\x93 because I believe people should be able to live to theyâ\\x80\\x99re 100 years old â\\x80\\x93 you should seek spiritual enlightenment. My mission right now is to reach a billion people for personal and social transformation through philanthropy and education, and by creating networks of service, compassion and spiritual practice â\\x80\\x93 in the hopes of creating a more peaceful, sustainable and joyful world. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no doubt that we need that more than ever today. There is no social transformation in the absence of personal transformation. You canâ\\x80\\x99t create peace, for example, by being an angry peace activist.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 07 January 2020  A modest pickup in global growth is expected to greet investors in 2020. While this optimism has seen investors shift to riskier assets, Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Christian Mueller-Glissmann says thereâ\\x80\\x99s a risk that they could be disappointedâ\\x80¦eventually. We sat down with Christian to discuss multi-asset themes and risks for 2020.  Christian, how are investors positioned for the new year?  Christian Mueller-Glissmann: Global growth worries, in part due to US/China trade tensions, pushed investors to take more defensive positions in the first half of 2019. Boosted by easier monetary policy, they limited their growth exposure and focused on the search for yield. Growth concerns have started to subside and a moderately more optimistic outlook has supported a rotation towards riskier assets, encouraging investors to increase their pro-cyclical exposure. But markets have moved quickly to reprice for an expected rise in global growth since the summer. As a result, the markets may have overshotâ\\x80\\x94weâ\\x80\\x99ve only seen a moderate pick-up in global Purchasing Manager Indices so far. In the near term, increasing policy uncertainty and growth-related risks could lead to disappointment.  What are your asset allocation preferences for 2020?   CMG: Most assets performed well in 2019, producing positive returns across the board. While we donâ\\x80\\x99t expect 2020 to be as strong a year for multi-asset portfolios, we anticipate positive returns for equities due to the modest pick-up in growth and elevated equity risk premiums. We also expect global bond yields to pick up. So, weâ\\x80\\x99re modestly pro-risk in our asset allocation recommendations, with an overweight in equities and underweight in bonds. However, on a 12-month horizon weâ\\x80\\x99re moderating our pro-cyclical asset allocation with an overweight in cash because return potential across assets is more limited following such a strong year. Also, we prefer equities to credit because credit spreads are already very tight, creating a poor risk/reward.  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s your view on stock market valuation?   CMG: While the macro backdrop should be broadly favourable for equities in 2020, buoyed by loose financial conditions and a resilient US consumer, we believe a large portion of the growth momentum is already priced. The strong 2019 equity performance was driven by valuation expansion, as profit growth has generally remained subdued. If this is met with limited earnings growth, weâ\\x80\\x99ll only see moderate returns in 2020. But late cycle there is always the potential that valuations overshoot as well.  The correlation between equities and bonds has been a central theme of 2019. How will this relationship play out in 2020?   CMG: With our base case expectation of gradual increases in bond yields, from low levels and mostly driven by breakeven inflation, we think that equity/bond correlations should remain negative. However, after the large increase in 10-year yields so far, a continued bond selloff could drive indigestion for equities. On the flipside, with lower bond yields and less potential for further monetary policy easing, bonds might provide less of a buffer during equity corrections.  What are the key risks as we enter 2020?  CMG: Ongoing political events and policy uncertainty are key considerations. While the impact of the US/China trade tensions should be less negative in 2020 with recent progress on a deal, eventual disappointments cannot be ruled out and weaker China data could reduce risk appetite.  There are also downside risks to earnings expectations due to margin pressures. This risk is most prominent in the US, where there are potential headwinds from global trade tariffs, rising input costs and wage growth, as well as potential US tech regulation, which has been a focus into next year's US presidential election. And of course further tensions in the Middle East and sharp increases in oil prices might weigh on risk appetite.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 17 December 2019  As tech firms from Greater China seek protection from trade tensions, many are adding manufacturing capacity in Vietnam to build everything from AirPods to TVs. To find out more, we spoke to Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Allen Chang, who recently visited industrial parks across Vietnam to interview the tech companies expanding there.   Allen, given Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s unrivalled role in tech manufacturing, what attracts Greater China tech firms to Vietnam?  Allen Chang: Vietnam is an appealing prospect for these firms because it offers lower labor costs, a reprieve from American tariffs and tax incentives for tech companies. Although several manufacturers we talked to already had a minor presence in Vietnam as early as 2008, Apple suppliers FIT Hon Teng and Luxshare both specifically cited US-China trade tensions as they near factory openings in Vietnam. Similarly, Hon Haiâ\\x80\\x94better known as Foxconnâ\\x80\\x94and its subsidiaries have invested in Vietnam even as a planned factory in Wisconsin nears completion, and TCL Electronics is adding TV assembly capacity in both Vietnam and Mexico specifically to serve the American market.   So should we expect a mass migration of production capacity from China to Vietnam?  AC: The labor costs arenâ\\x80\\x99t quite that advantageousâ\\x80\\x94direct labor makes up less than 5% of the cost of goods sold for equipment makers, and the level of automation in Vietnam is much lower compared with China and nearby Southeast Asian countries. Staffing and training can also be an issueâ\\x80\\x94there are fewer English and Mandarin speakers in Vietnam than there are in mainland China, and several Chinese semiconductor producers also cite a lack of advanced engineering talent that could preclude any Vietnamese expansion. So for some companies, we think itâ\\x80\\x99ll ultimately make more sense to bear the costs of the tariffs and rely on the ready-made domestic supply chain in China rather than absorb added costs for transportation, infrastructure and training in Vietnam. Our takeaway is that Vietnam most likely offers more value in back-end processes, like final assembly, than high-end manufacturing processes like component development, panel production or semiconductor fabricationâ\\x80\\x94and weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing that reflected in the companies choosing the make the move.  How is this affecting Vietnam?  AC: The shift is producing new trade and investment. In September, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s exports of electronic products and components to Vietnam was up 24% from the prior year to US$3.2bn, while Vietnamâ\\x80\\x99s exports of those products to the US market was up 77% year over year through September. Foreign direct investment continues to grow â\\x80\\x94in September, newly registered capital increased by 187% year over year while new FDI projects increased 34%.  Some manufacturers we talked to predicted a broader shift away from centralized production in China towards a more regional focus to minimize political economic risks. In Vietnam at least, the government is already conscious of growing pains from such a shift, warning that severe power shortages could start from 2021 amid increased demand.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 10 December 2019  After a string of recent mega mergers, food companies are hunkering down to digest their acquisitionsâ\\x80\\x94resulting in a slew of spinoffs and divestitures as they look to streamline their operations. We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Ben Frost, head of Mergers & Acquisitions for the Consumer Retail Group in the Investment Banking Division, to discuss the drivers behind recent banking transactions.  Until recently, mega mergersâ\\x80\\x94like the deals that brought together Kraft and Heinz, as well as Anheuser Busch and InBevâ\\x80\\x94were a feature of the consumer packaged food-industry. With M&A activity starting to slow, what are companies focused on now?  Ben Frost: Most of the big M&A deals we saw in 2015 and 2016 were driven by food companiesâ\\x80\\x99 desire to get into new categories to grow their businesses or get bigger in categories that they were in to take advantage of scale. Today, weâ\\x80\\x99re in the aftermath of that buying spree as companies are pruning their portfolios, reducing debt and pursuing divestitures or spinoffs of noncore businesses. Inevitably, there are parts of an acquisition that arenâ\\x80\\x99t as synergistic or as aligned with the companyâ\\x80\\x99s core growth strategy, so companies are assessing whether it makes sense to sell certain brands to other owners, often to private equity.  In determining which of their businesses to sell, companies are often evaluating the future potential growth of a category and how difficult a business is to run and manage compared with the core of what they do. For example, Campbell Soup recently sold its Bolthouse Farms business to an investor group led by its former CEO given some of the challenges of running a fresh food business, which is a fundamentally different business for Campbell to manage.  In general, consumer packaged food companies have been struggling against the backdrop of slowing growth, lower inflation, pressure from distribution partners (notably Amazon) as well changing consumer tastes. Many, as a result, have branched into private label offerings which have, in turn, put additional pressure on branded companies to further reduce costs for retailers.  Where have food companies looked for growth and how have consumersâ\\x80\\x99 changing tastes and habits affected where companies are investing?  Ben Frost: For many years, the baby food and pet food categories have been big growth drivers for packaged food companies. A broader trend toward snackingâ\\x80\\x94with people eating more frequently than they used toâ\\x80\\x94has also pushed companies to offer smaller, portable packages that can be sold in convenience stores or delis. At the same time, there has been a consistent move to eat outside of the home. In the 1950s, people used to eat three square meals in their home. Today, more often than not, theyâ\\x80\\x99re eating most of their meals outside. Meanwhile, an overall trend to health and wellness has pushed companies to acquire innovative brands that are making more nutritious foods.  How are traditional food brands competing with new, nimbler entrants into the industry?  Ben Frost: Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a real concern that large-cap food companies just arenâ\\x80\\x99t able to innovate the way they used to. But after many years of focusing on cost cutting and increased efficiencies, today many of the large-cap food companies have pivoted toward a focus on innovation and new product development. Tyson Foods, for example, just announced a new line of alternative and blended plant-based proteins. Kraft Heinz has redoubled its efforts to reinvest in its brands, extending the Heinz brand to mustard and launching new ketchup flavors, such as hot and spicy. Innovation is going to be more important than itâ\\x80\\x99s been in the last few years, given startups are shaping new trends and categories. Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard for a lot of these big companies to do that, so we expect weâ\\x80\\x99ll continue to see more acquisitions.  Online sales have started to transform not just what weâ\\x80\\x99re eating, but how weâ\\x80\\x99re getting our food. How are businesses adapting to that?  Ben Frost: In the battleground of online versus in-store grocery shopping, traditional retailers such as Kroger, Albertsons and Walmart have rolled out drive-up services that allow shoppers to shop online and pull up to designated spaces at their local stores and have their purchases delivered directly to their vehicles. People who participate in these services are more likely to order the same items week after week. While they may not physically wander the aisles as much as they used to, theyâ\\x80\\x99re likely to stick with the brands they know. The irony is that, without the foot traffic in the stores, itâ\\x80\\x99s harder for the smaller and up-and-coming brands to get noticed by consumers, while giving an edge to the larger, established brands.  Ben, you recently joined Goldman Sachs after many years at another financial services firm. How are you finding life at the firm so far?   Ben Frost: After 18 months with the firm, the partnership mentality that permeates the entire organization is what stands out the most to me. The thoughtfulness that it is led and managed with a focus on the long-term success of its franchises makes it apparent why Goldman Sachs has been such a consistent market leader. Fortunately, both clients and colleagues have made the switch as seamless and enjoyable as I could have imagined.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 03 December 2019  The sharp fall in the cost of installing and generating renewable power is driving the shift to low-carbon technologies. We sat down with Taylor Jordan â\\x80\\x93 who co-founded impact investment advisory firm Imprint Capital (which Goldman Sachs bought in 2015)â\\x80\\x93 to discuss clean energy investment opportunities.  Impact investing is clearly on a growth trajectory. What is driving this in your view?      Taylor Jordan: There are two main drivers. First, we now have a broad set of investors who want to leverage their assets to create tangible impact. That has expanded from foundations, which were among the earlier adopters, to family offices and now institutional investors. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll continue to see growth in impact strategies as wealth transfers to younger generations that naturally embed their values into both their purchase and investment decisions. To give you a sense of scale, more than $11 trillion is expected to be invested in new power generation capacity globally by 2050, of which nearly three-quarters is expected to go to new wind or solar farms. This translates to an average of over $250 billion of capital invested in renewable energy assets each year through 2050, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Second, impact themes are benefitting from a broad set of macro tailwinds. Take clean energy: early investors poured billions into the sector which resulted in a significant drop in the cost of installing and generating power â\\x80\\x94 positioning renewables to become the dominant form of new power installation going forward.  Now that the costs of installing clean energy are nearly comparable with conventional sources, why havenâ\\x80\\x99t we seen broader residential adoption of, say, rooftop solar panels?      Taylor Jordan: Utility-scale projects were responsible for roughly 60% of solar installation in 2018, while non-residential and residential projects made up the remaining 20% and 23%, respectively, of capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. But the adoption of residential solar has been highly unequal and skewed toward higher-income homeowners. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s because 77% of US households are prevented from installing rooftop solar panels due to low credit scores, roof shading or because they donâ\\x80\\x99t own their own home, according to greentechmedia.com.  But community solar projects are emerging as a way to democratize access to clean energy. Essentially, community solar projects are local solar facilities that are shared by multiple community subscribers â\\x80\\x93 including both homeowners and renters â\\x80\\x93 who receive credit on their electricity bills for their share of the power produced. While these projects are gaining rapid adoption across the US, the development has lagged demand due to a lack of financing options. Lenders and investors have been hesitant to finance due to the relatively new nature of these projects, while their relatively small size makes them less attractive to large institutional investors. However, we believe community solar is posed for strong growth due to the size of the addressable market.  What are some of the other environmental opportunities that youâ\\x80\\x99re evaluating?   Taylor Jordan: While equity returns on operating large-scale utility projects have fallen to about 5% to 6%, we see value in other parts of the market. For example, there are pockets of opportunity in commercial and industrial solar, battery storage and grid services. In sustainable transit, the continued evolution of connected vehicles, electric vehicles and eventually autonomous vehicles looks promising, and weâ\\x80\\x99re also looking at opportunities beyond cars, such as buses and motorcycles. In food and agriculture, there are opportunities in agriculture technologies that improve efficiency and yield, while taking advantage of changing consumer preferences in areas such as alternative proteins. Weâ\\x80\\x99re also seeing interesting businesses in waste and materials, such as bioplastics.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 26 November 2019  Family offices have become one of the fastest-growing investors within the asset management industry. We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Sara Naison-Tarajano, head of Apex, the firmâ\\x80\\x99s dedicated family-office coverage team in the Consumer and Investment Management Division (CIMD), and Meena Flynn, CIMDâ\\x80\\x99s global head of the Markets Solution Group and one of the partners leading the cross-divisional family-office initiative, who shared their perspectives on the industry.  Apex recently hosted its second annual Family Office Symposium in New York. What were some of the key takeaways?      Sara Naison-Tarajano: The goal of the symposium was to provide family-office CIOs and owners with content ranging from investing and macroeconomic trends, to trading and impact investing. Based on the responses of more than 140 attendees, investors were highly focused on direct investing, with two of the most popular sessions focused on investing in the private markets and investing in real estate. We also saw a lot of interest in topics focused on social impact investing, such as sustainable food systems. In fact, we estimate about one-third of family offices industrywide are now involved in impact investing, with interest in environmental, social and governance investing expected to increase as the next generation of family members assumes control.     How do family offices fit within the world of asset management? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s driving their growth?     Sara Naison-Tarajano: Family offices have become an increasingly powerful force within asset management, especially in the private markets. A favorable macroeconomic backdrop, rising mergers-and-acquisition activity and increasing valuations in the private markets have spurred individuals to sell their businesses at attractive valuations, creating demand for advisory firms that work with family offices. Meanwhile, a growing number of hedge fund ownersâ\\x80\\x94faced with succession planning, hefty operational costs and other pressuresâ\\x80\\x94are returning outside capital and converting to family offices to manage their own funds. The desire to preserve family wealth and create a legacy through philanthropic giving is yet another catalyst.   How are family offices emerging as an investing force?   Sara Naison-Tarajano: As family offices increase in size and assets under management, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve become more institutional in their approach and are often competing directly with private equity investors, venture capital firms and pension funds for many of the same investment opportunities, often in the private markets. Some family offices are even taking in outside capital. Based on our experience, weâ\\x80\\x99ve often found that the family office owner tends to have experience and confidence in his or her ability to make transformative investment decisions, in part, because theyâ\\x80\\x99ve spent their lives building and running multi-million dollar businesses. As investors, they tend to be generalists, sector agnostic and opportunistic. In addition, because family offices donâ\\x80\\x99t have to report to a board of directors, investor group or regulators, theyâ\\x80\\x99re able to be more flexible their investment approaches.  Meena, youâ\\x80\\x99re one of the partners leading an initiative to better service select family office clients by aligning the companyâ\\x80\\x99s divisions to work in concert with each other. How has the growth in family offices changed the way that firms work with them?  Meena Flynn: Family offices typically prefer to develop a single, long-term relationship with a senior professional at the firm who can navigate and harness the resources of the firm on their behalf. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s more, their financial needs are global, complex and multi-faceted. From the clientsâ\\x80\\x99 perspective, they view Goldman Sachs as one firm, so weâ\\x80\\x99ve made a concerted effort to reorganize ourselves according to that view. As part of a new family office initiative, weâ\\x80\\x99ve put together small teams that cover clients holistically and offer comprehensive services from across the firm â\\x80\\x93 ranging from investing and lending, investment banking, trading and risk management, to custody and philanthropy services.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 19 November 2019  Dutch company DSM was once one of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s largest bulk chemical companies. But over the last three decades, it has transformed itself into a cutting-edge, purpose and performance-led science company whose strategy is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At a recent Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) Forum event, Katie Koch, co-head of GSAMâ\\x80\\x99s Fundamental Equity business, spoke with Feike Sijbesma, DSMâ\\x80\\x99s CEO of 13 years, about the companyâ\\x80\\x99s journey and the impact that corporations can have on climate change and malnutrition, among other global issues.  Katie Koch: DSM once stood for Dutch State Mines but today, the company is no longer Dutch, state-run or in the mining space. Can you talk about the companyâ\\x80\\x99s journey to becoming a company driven by purpose, and focused on health, nutrition and sustainable living?     Feike Sijbesma: DSM started in 1902 as a coal mining company in the Netherlands at a time when approximately 40% of the country was dependent on coal. But by the 1970s, the production of coal gave way to chemicals, and DSM underwent its first transformation into a chemicals producer. Then, about 20 years ago, we decided to divest our bulk chemicals business and embarked on our second big transformation to reinvent ourselves into a life sciences company. From a macroeconomic viewpoint, it made sense to focus our investments on solving the worldâ\\x80\\x99s biggest needs â\\x80\\x93 whether it is to reduce hunger or slow the pace of climate change. I firmly believe that it is possible to make money while contributing to a better society. In fact, Iâ\\x80\\x99m convinced itâ\\x80\\x99s the only responsible way to make money in the future.      Katie Koch: Can you talk about DSMâ\\x80\\x99s approach to innovation, and how those innovations are aligned with the companyâ\\x80\\x99s mission?  Feike Sijbesma: Given DSMâ\\x80\\x99s business strategy is aligned with the UN SDGs, and many of the issues addressed by the goals donâ\\x80\\x99t yet have viable large-scale solutions, innovation is at the heart of everything we do. For example, weâ\\x80\\x99ve spent a lot of time looking at ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and learned that methane emissions from cows and other livestock account for nearly 15% of global GHG emissions. As a result, we developed an ingredient we call Clean Cow which can be mixed into livestock feed and results in a 30% reduction in methane emissions from cow burps. But these types of innovations take time to have large-scale impact. You need to identify the problem, design the concept, create a product, and attract customers. In some cases, the process calls for working with governments and regulators, and convincing them that thereâ\\x80\\x99s a need. It takes time, but it can be done.   Katie Koch: Youâ\\x80\\x99ve said before that DSM is open to collaborating with other companies on innovations. How do you cultivate that culture within your organization?  Feike Sijibesma: In many companies, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a mindset that if you didnâ\\x80\\x99t come up with an idea, it means youâ\\x80\\x99ve failed. But in all of the fields that weâ\\x80\\x99re in, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a minefield of patents and technologies â\\x80\\x93 we donâ\\x80\\x99t own everything. That means we can continue to fight on our own to find a solution or we can combine forces with other companies to reach the answer more quickly, for the collective good. So in an effort to change the mindset of our employees, about eight years ago our Chief Innovation Officer started a new internal narrative around our innovations, which we call â\\x80\\x9cProudly Found Elsewhere.â\\x80\\x9d This initiative has cultivated a culture of open innovation, which has led to 80+ academic partnerships, 30+ Public-Private Partnerships, and various venturing projects, IP arrangements and joint ventures â\\x80\\x93 all aimed at fulfilling our purpose of creating brighter lives for all.    Katie Koch: So to pick up on the idea of changing mindsets, how have you been able to successfully push the company in a different direction and what were some of the challenges?   Feike Sijibesma: I always try to have a vision on whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening in the world and a vision of where our company should go â\\x80\\x93 and then we go and pursue it. I develop this vision by traveling, interacting with our people and clients, picking up new ideas and adjusting my views based on those conversations. The narrative of the company has to be consistent with what is happening under the hood and in the real world. This is essential to being viewed as credible. Once you have the vision, you need to be able to communicate it effectively with your people. You have to be open and transparent on what youâ\\x80\\x99re doing.   Katie Koch: So I want to stick on this concept that you can do good in the world while also doing well by your shareholders. Recently in the US, the Business Roundtable made a statement advocating for executives to take a more expansive view of their companyâ\\x80\\x99s role in society, beyond serving shareholders. Are we at a point where corporations can be leaders in addressing global issues such as climate change if governments are falling behind?   Feike Sijibesma: Yes, I think so. Today, there are many multinational companies who have a huge impact on society and are able to have influence across borders. Governmentsâ\\x80\\x99 jurisdictions, on the other hand, stop at those borders. As companiesâ\\x80\\x99 impact on customers grows, so should their responsibility for impact. The private sector should take a leadership role in addressing climate change, but collaboration between governments and companies is still needed because neither can solve the worldâ\\x80\\x99s problem on their own.

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 11 November 2019  Asian hedge funds are one of the bright spots in the hedge fund industry, fueled by strong inflows, robust performance and Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s moves to open up its financial markets. We caught up with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Padideh Raphael, whose team recently hosted almost 500 investors, managers and other market practitioners at the firmâ\\x80\\x99s 20th annual Asia Hedge Fund Symposium in Tokyo.  Hedge funds â\\x80\\x93 private investment partnerships designed for wealthy individuals and institutional investors â\\x80\\x93 are relatively new to Asia. How has the industry evolved?   Padideh Raphael: Just two decades ago, Asia hedge fund managers collectively controlled about $10 billion of assets. Today, total assets under management (AUM) have jumped to a record $330 billion, with roughly 80% of that growth recorded in the past five years, according to HFM AsiaHedge. And when you consider the rapidly expanding Asia allocation of global funds, the total AUM almost doubles.  We have also seen an evolution in hedge fund strategies. Two decades ago, Asia-based strategy composition was fairly simple; most funds were long-bias, equity long/short and focused mostly on Japan. Pan-Asia funds, which invest opportunistically across Asia, were still considered an emerging strategy.  Today, Asia managers cover the entire spectrum of strategies, asset classes and investment philosophies, with a geographical reach that spans the breadth of this vast region. There are also a number of Asia managers who are successfully investing globally.   What's been driving this growth?  PR: A confluence of factors has spurred the growth in Asia hedge funds including Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s moves to open its financial markets to foreign capital, corporate governance reforms in Japan, and the increasing sophistication of talent and investment tools in the region. As managers have built their track records and as investment strategies have matured, this has drawn significant attention and capital to the region.  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s more, Asian hedge funds are living up to investor expectations. Despite slightly lower returns year-to-date, the overall compounded outperformance of hedge-funds returns in Asia versus index performance over the past five years stands at 32%, which is higher than both the US and Europe, according to our analysis.  Which market is attracting the most interest?  PR: Without a doubt, it's China. China-dedicated strategies have been the fastest-growing segment over the past five years, and now comprise the largest proportion of regional AUM at 20%. To a certain extent, this is a natural response to moves by global index providers to increase the weighting of mainland Chinese stocks in their indices, which should trigger sizable passive flows of capital into the local equity markets. Even Japan â\\x80\\x93 whose corporate governance reforms have been an investment theme in their own right â\\x80\\x93 has a China angle. For example, there are now managers looking at Japanese equities as a way to monetize the growth of Chinese outbound tourism.  The flipside of this coin is that performance can be sensitive to geopolitical trends. Persistent trade tensions between the US and China largely explain the weaker performance of Asia hedge fundsâ\\x80\\x99 year-on-year returns.  Given these risks, what is the outlook for Asian hedge funds?   PR: Despite the current challenges, we're optimistic that the hedge fund industry will continue to expand in Asia. For starters, we are seeing vibrant industry dynamics in our own pipeline. In addition, new fund launches are up by twice the average over the past decade, and we've seen a strong increase in new prime brokerage mandates overall, from both new clients as well as product extensions from our long-term clients.  The strategic engagement of global clients is also showing signs of acceleration as well.  Firms with a long-term presence in the region, whether in Hong Kong, Singapore or Tokyo, are expanding their local footprints, adding to research and risk-taking capabilities. Indeed, one of the key constraints to growth appears to be a bottleneck in talent sourcing, rather than any cooling off in interest in the region.  If we look historically, our proprietary data show that of the 129 hedge fund start-ups in Asia that Goldman Sachs has partnered with since 2009, roughly two-thirds are still operating, a clear testimony to the quality of the opportunities in the region and the level of sophistication the industry has attained. Not surprisingly, funds that began life ahead of a market correction have typically had a lower survival rate. For example, only 27% of the Asia Pacific funds that started in 2010 are still operating today due to challenging market conditions that followed. However, large launches have proved to be more resilient, with $50 million emerging as a possible level of critical mass where a fundâ\\x80\\x99s chances of surviving dramatically increase.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 28 October 2019  Despite Japanâ\\x80\\x99s aging population and mounting public debt, the country offers a host of investment opportunities, according to Katie Koch, co-head of Goldman Sachs Asset Managementâ\\x80\\x99s (GSAM) Fundamental Equity business. Koch recently returned from GSAMâ\\x80\\x99s annual Investor Tour, held this year in Tokyo and Kyoto, where the team hosted 20 CEOs, CIOs and heads of equity from large global institutions along with Japanese policy makers, government officials and C-suite executives.  Katie, why did you elect to go to Japan for this yearâ\\x80\\x99s Investor Tour?    Katie Koch: Japan is changing incredibly rapidly, but it continues to be misunderstood and, for the most part, underappreciated by investors. Indeed, Japan is the only major global equity market that has actually had a de-rating in its price-to-earnings multiple since the global financial crisis. This is despite dramatic improvements in corporate governance and the fact that there are many companies poised to benefit from strong secular growth trends, such as the strengthening emerging markets consumer, the rise of autonomous and electric vehicles and the growth of robotics. We wanted to take our clients to Japan to explore the idea that it may be the worldâ\\x80\\x99s most underrated equity market and therefore provide tremendous wealth creation potential.   What were clients seeking to learn from the Tour and what were the major takeaways?   KK: Our clients on the Tour, who represent $3.2 trillion in assets, wanted to gain a deeper, first-hand understanding of the changes happening across Japan â\\x80\\x93 from economic policy to corporate culture to shifting social attitudes. We met with executives at leading companies including Softbank, Takeda, Shiseido, Nidec and others.  From our conversations with these companies, it is clear that change â\\x80\\x93 even if slow â\\x80\\x93 is happening everywhere. For one, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing companies once again focus on investing in innovation. As Takedaâ\\x80\\x99s CEO, Christophe Weber, highlighted: Japan has a long history of innovation, having been at the forefront of many major advancements in the 1970s and 1980s. And, even in recent years, Japan has remained a leader in many areas of R&D, but has suffered from an inability to successfully commercialize such work. Takedaâ\\x80\\x99s decision to partner with Kyoto Universityâ\\x80\\x99s Shinya Yamanaka â\\x80\\x93 who won the 2012 Nobel Prize for his work in stem cells â\\x80\\x93 is just one example where the private sector is helping to change this dynamic.  Many Japanese companies are also extremely well placed to benefit from the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the pervasive nature of technology. Micro motor and electronic component manufacturers, such as Nidec and Murata Manufacturing, are now critical suppliers to companies across industries like electric and autonomous vehicles, robotics and automation, the Internet of Things and 5G. So, while they may not be the first companies investors would think of when they consider these secular themes, they are among the best placed to benefit globally.  What are some of the macroeconomic headwinds Japan is facing?    KK: Japan has the highest level of debt-to-GDP ratio of any developed country. The country is struggling to generate inflation and its aging population is estimated to fall to 100 million by 2050 from 127 million today. But there are positive changes on the horizon. Women are entering the workforce in greater numbers â\\x80\\x93 a topic on which my colleague, Kathy Matsui of Goldman Sachs Research, has written extensively about in her â\\x80\\x9cWomenomicsâ\\x80\\x9d research. And while immigration is still a politically sensitive issue, the government is issuing more temporary three-year visas and student visas, signaling an increasing openness.   You have visited Japan for many years. What are some of the biggest changes that youâ\\x80\\x99ve seen?   KK:  Weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing a big shift in how companies are talking about corporate governance. When I first went to Japan, management teams were often very evasive when you challenged them on corporate governance initiatives. At best you would get vague or unsatisfactory responses, at worst they would walk out of the meeting! On our latest Investor Tour, nearly every speaker addressed corporate governance reforms proactively and shared their efforts to improve diversity and shareholder returns. For example, Jun Ohta, president and group CEO of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, highlighted the fact that 99% of companies now have at least two independent directors on their board, compared with only about 20% in 2012. Proxy voting procedures are more transparent while the practice of cross-shareholding â\\x80\\x93 or mutual holdings among allied companies â\\x80\\x93 is down, especially at financial institutions.  We also observed a new willingness from companies to look outside their organization for talent and fresh ideas â\\x80\\x93 an approach that has been historically uncommon. For example, Masahiko Uotani, Shiseidoâ\\x80\\x99s CEO who previously worked for Coca-Cola, and Christophe Weber, Takedaâ\\x80\\x99s first non-Japanese president and CEO, have both broken down silos across operating businesses, driven greater innovation, enhanced the global orientation and increased diversity of the management team and the board of their respective companies. As these changes continue to emerge across the Japanese corporate landscape, our confidence that they can be self-sustaining also increases.   How are foreign investors typically exposed to Japanese equities in their portfolios?   KK: Most foreign investors get exposure to Japanese equities through an EAFE or a global allocation, with most global mandates ending up with roughly a 10-15% allocation. From our perspective, we believe a strategic, standalone allocation can be a superior approach. Overall, the pace of change across Japan Inc. is uneven and we expect to see a wide range of outcomes for Japanese corporates. Those that are aligned to key secular growth trends and are fully committed to improving governance and enhancing minority shareholder returns should be exciting opportunities. Those that fail to adapt, or are unwilling to change, should suffer. This backdrop for there to be new winners and losers, ultimately makes Japan a compelling market for stock pickers.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 21 October 2019  Climate change, advancing technologies and shifting workforce dynamics are among the top priorities for small businesses in the UK, according to survey results released by Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x9910,000 Small Businesses UK at the firmâ\\x80\\x99s Business 2030 conference held in London earlier this month. We spoke with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Charlotte Keenan, who leads the firmâ\\x80\\x99s Office of Corporate Engagement for the EMEA and APAC regions, to share how entrepreneurs are running their businesses in the face of global uncertainty.   Charlotte, based on the report â\\x80\\x93 which surveyed more than 400 companies that completed the 10KSB UK program â\\x80\\x93 it seems like small businesses are optimistic about the future. What specifically did the survey find?   Charlotte Keenan: Going into the survey we had expected that small business owners would see issues such as sustainability, social impact, climate change and technological innovation as less of a priority given resource and capital constraints. But todayâ\\x80\\x99s entrepreneurs believe these are all issues that canâ\\x80\\x99t be ignored and actually view them as essential opportunities for future growth. About 93% of those surveyed felt their businesses had an obligation to do good in their communities. And while nearly half of respondents said AI had replaced manual processes in their businesses, only 7% laid off their employees as a result. Instead, two-thirds of respondents focused on re-training displaced workers into other jobs. Meanwhile, climate change is top of mind with 86% saying they plan to introduce new strategies to reduce their environmental footprint over the next decade. We are seeing small businesses reconfigure their operations, align with purpose-driven missions, utilize automation and train their staff for the future. Overall, small businesses appear to be on the vanguard of driving and shaping the broader impact revolution.   That all sounds positive, but given the broader uncertainty around Brexit, how are small businesses responding?  CK: Despite the uncertainty over Brexit, small businesses are continuing to drive the UK economy. Not only are they maintaining their usual business, they are also exploring new ways to protect â\\x80\\x93 even expand â\\x80\\x93 their supply chains within and outside of the UK. To be sure, the longer the political uncertainty continues, the more challenging it becomes for small businesses to sustain growth. To find and recruit talent is a key example, and Brexit is already having an impact on available talent in the UK. Even against the backdrop of these challenges, the encouraging news is that, according to our findings, small business owners are actually on the forefront of driving innovation â\\x80\\x93 they are already identifying the opportunities that lie within these challenges and finding new ways to grow.  Can you describe the role that small businesses play in the UK?   CK: Small businesses contribute approximately 60% of all private sector employment and more than 50% of all private sector revenue, according to the Federation of Small Businesses. They are significant drivers of growth for the national economy and at the heart of their local communities. Whilst 10KSB UK graduates are optimistic about the opportunities they face in the next decade, there are concerns about the broader small business community; outside of 10KSB UK there is still a support gap for small businesses, with just 25% feeling that they get the support they need to succeed and grow.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 15 October 2019  Faced with geopolitical uncertainty, a slowing economy and negative yields, more than 180 German companies shared their strategies and challenges with investors at Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 eighth annual German Corporate Conference, held in Munich last month. We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Michael Schmitz, co-head of the Securities Division in Germany and Austria, to discuss key takeaways from the event.  Michael, based on your conversations with clients, what is the sentiment among investors and German corporates?  Michael Schmitz: There was a divergence in sentiment between investors, who were rather negative, and corporate clients, who were cautiously comfortable. Investors, for their part, focused on current economic data which indicated that a slowdown in global trade was weighing on the German manufacturing sector and the DAX stock market index. Meanwhile, German corporations, which have gotten used to operating in a volatile environment, have been guiding earnings expectations lower since the second quarter.  The German economy has slowed significantly since 2018, and we expect a technical recession (two negative quarters of growth) in the second half of 2019. However, we do not expect a deep downturn and we believe thereâ\\x80\\x99s scope for improvement if and when thereâ\\x80\\x99s a pause in the global trade conflict and a Brexit resolution is found. Moreover, support for measured fiscal expansion (including green investment) seems to be gaining political traction in Germany, while the European Central Bankâ\\x80\\x99s latest stimulus package ensures that financial conditions remain accommodative.  Indeed, with regard to German equities performance, the picture is not that dire. The DAX is up 18% year-to-date through September. How do you explain that?  MS: We think this relative resilience is a function of changes in the German index. While the DAX still has exposure to the slowdown in global trade â\\x80\\x93 with 15% in China and 35% in industrials, chemicals and autos â\\x80\\x93 the technology sector now makes up 13% of the index, which is a higher proportion than any other blue-chip index in Europe. Other growth or growth-defensive sectors, such as healthcare and real estate, have also increased as a proportion of the DAX. These sectors tend to do well in a low-inflation and falling yield environment. Altogether, we think the DAX is fairly valued compared with the rest of Europe.  Could you share a few thoughts on the negative yield environment in Germany and how companies are thinking about their capital allocation strategies?   MS: Over the course of the three-day conference, the topic of corporationsâ\\x80\\x99 capital allocation priorities dominated the discussion. Negative yields have incentivized corporates to borrow more and increase buyback activity, resulting in a shrinkage of equity supply as a percentage of market cap. In addition, investors were also focused on whether companies were planning to use their cash to engage in M&A.   What are potential challenges that could test the ability of the German economy to deliver long-term growth?  MS: The country still has a strong industrial base which is currently undergoing a profound transformation. Investors are observing closely how companies are addressing four major challenges. First, the automobile industry is facing a major transformation as it transitions from manufacturing combustion engines to electric vehicles. Second, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a potential for some degree of deglobalization given current economic and political developments. This will have implications on many levels for Germany as its manufacturing sector is tightly integrated into global value chains. Third, companies will need to continue to invest in the digitization of production processes, which is likely to raise productivity and businessesâ\\x80\\x99 ability to customize production on a larger scale. Finally, as climate change becomes an ever-more important topic, German companies have to reduce their carbon footprint. This transition will not be easy and, in some cases, entire business models will need to be redefined.  What do you think the prospects are from here?  MS: The ability of the German economy to cope with these structural challenges will be decided by its overall innovative capacity and policy responses. Germany has always been known for its innovative strength. Given this, we are optimistic that the country will be able to cope with the structural challenges mentioned earlier. Also, Germany has some distinctive advantages: low debt, high savings, low financing costs and a highly-qualified workforce. These factors will not insulate it from the shorter-term headwinds, but should provide the basis for longer-term growth and prosperity. From an investment perspective, many of the German equities we like fall into one of four categories: fast-growth or disruptive retailers, technology, real estate and companies focused on renewables.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 07 October 2019  Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s food habits are changing in ways that will have long-term repercussions for the world, says Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Trina Chen. We sat down with her to learn more about whatâ\\x80\\x99s driving the shift in consumption and how China can meet these new demands.  Trina, you recently wrote about a shift in Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s eating habits â\\x80\\x93 which includes a greater consumption of meat, for example â\\x80\\x93 that you say deserves global attention. Tell us whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening and why itâ\\x80\\x99s so significant.  Trina Chen: Weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing urbanization and rising incomes start to shift how Chinese consumers are eating. More specifically, we think this is the start of a trend where Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s growing food demand â\\x80\\x93 which will be sizable in the coming years â\\x80\\x93 will be more about quality than quantity, and will affect Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s basic crop demand. If you look at historical patterns for peer countries, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see that consumption of high-quality proteins like milk, chicken, and beef tend to rise with GDP, particularly when consumersâ\\x80\\x99 annual disposable incomes reach US $5,000 to $10,000. China is in the midst of this transition, which should translate into higher demand for the proteins themselves, as well as the crops needed to feed livestock.  Will China have enough resources to accommodate growing demand?  TC: In short, we donâ\\x80\\x99t think so; at least, not on its own. Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s agricultural resources are already stretched, and rising demand will only stress food supply further. The country has historically relied on pesticides and fertilizers to increase its crop yields, but these solutions have deteriorated water and soil quality, while generating only muted productivity gains for major crops, such as corn and soybeans. Additionally, rapid urbanization has driven substantial price increases in labor and land, putting China's production cost for major crops and animal proteins at nearly twice the level of other major agriculture countries. And these are just the structural trends that China is contending with â\\x80\\x93 once you add in supply disruptions, such as African Swine Fever, it appears less likely that local supply will be able to meet local demand.  What is the long-term supply solution?  TC: We think it will be two-fold. First, we expect imports to increase â\\x80\\x93 both in overall volume and their contribution to the domestic market â\\x80\\x93 and weâ\\x80\\x99re already seeing this trend reflected in the data. In fact, the Chinese government stated this year that it plans to proactively increase certain imports to ensure the nationâ\\x80\\x99s food security. And this goes back to your earlier question of why Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s changing food habits are something we need to pay attention to globally: We estimate that increased imports for beef and milk alone will boost global trade by 40% to 50% in the coming years. The second part of the solution, in our view, are greater efficiency gains â\\x80\\x93 such as consolidation or investment in innovations â\\x80\\x93 that can help China get more from the land it already harvests. We think the supply stress and industry inefficiencies will provide incredible investment opportunities. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s more incentive, for example, for China to adopt many of the precision agriculture technologies that are already taking root in other parts of the world. And weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing groundbreaking innovations in this space â\\x80\\x93 everything from hybrid rice seeds that can deliver a 30% increase in yields to drone-based crop monitoring. Weâ\\x80\\x99re only just scratching the surface of whatâ\\x80\\x99s possible here.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 1 October 2019  At a time of rising climate activism, The Conservation Fund (TCF) â\\x80\\x93 partnering with Goldman Sachs â\\x80\\x93 tapped the capital markets with an inaugural debt issuance to scale its mission: to protect 1 million acres of Americaâ\\x80\\x99s privately held working forests. We sat down with TCFâ\\x80\\x99s CEO and CFO Larry Selzer and John Gilbert, respectively, and Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Kyung-Ah Park and Ritu Kalra to talk about the conservation sectorâ\\x80\\x99s evolving approach to sustainable growth and the role of capital markets.   Kyung-Ah, as head of environmental markets and innovation in our Sustainable Finance Group, how are companies, our clients and the industry more broadly addressing critical environmental issues?   Kyung-Ah Park: Our conversations with clients about climate change â\\x80\\x93 both climate transition and resiliency â\\x80\\x93 have ramped up sharply and companies are increasingly turning to sustainable solutions and innovative finance that can unlock greater investment flow. For example, green bonds â\\x80\\x93 or bonds whose proceeds are earmarked for environmentally beneficial projects â\\x80\\x93 have seen significant momentum and are an important tool to tap into the deep and liquid fixed income market for positive environmental impact. If fixed income instruments can support financing for green solutions, they can also do so for other sustainability purposes, including enabling more inclusive growth and providing capital to help disadvantaged groups. As a result, the green bond market has expanded to include social and sustainability bonds and we are also seeing sustainability-linked loans. More recently, there have been other innovations in the capital markets to mainstream sustainable finance, including a first-of-its-kind sustainability performance-linked bond that we helped structure for a global utility. Specifically, the bond is a general purpose bond issued at the corporate level with the coupon linked to a renewable energy performance target.  Last week, the firm served as the sole underwriter for a $150 million green bond for  The Conservation Fund â\\x80\\x93 the first such nonprofit to issue a green bond dedicated to permanent land conservation. Ritu, as head of higher education and non-profit finance in our Investment Banking Division, what is unique about the transaction and what was the reception from investors?   Ritu Kalra: Whatâ\\x80\\x99s unique is that 100% of the proceeds of the green bond will go toward achieving permanent land conservation. TCF â\\x80\\x93 through its Working Forest Fund â\\x80\\x93 has pioneered a financially sustainable model to protect working forests, while supporting the local economies that rely on these ecosystems. The bond itself is structured to offer a market rate of return and has attracted significant interest from a mix of institutional investors and family offices. Keep in mind that timber as an investment has historically yielded about 5% to 6% â\\x80\\x93 which is especially attractive in todayâ\\x80\\x99s low-yield environment. TCF is also leveraging the bond proceeds with philanthropic capital which will enable it to make a greater impact. Going forward, we believe that achieving large-scale, long-term success in conservation will require the use of these types of innovative models.   Larry and John, can you explain the catalyst behind the fundraising and the role that TCF plays in combating climate change?  Larry Selzer: Forests are an essential part of Americaâ\\x80\\x99s infrastructure. They provide us with clean air to breathe, clean water to drink and jobs for more than 8.5 million people. Additionally, forests are an integral part of addressing climate change, offsetting as much as 20% of our annual carbon emissions. Yet we have lost more than 36 million acres of forests in the past three decades, and might lose another 30 million if we donâ\\x80\\x99t step in. Institutional investors, who now own roughly 50 million acres of timberland in the U.S., buy and sell these lands as financial assets, and when they do, many forests end up fragmented and developed. Our model for working forest conservation allows us to acquire these forests when they come on the market, permanently conserve them and return them to the private sector.  We have already acquired and conserved more than 650,000 acres through our Working Forest Fund and are targeting 5 million acres of high conservation value forests over the next 10 to 15 years. In the near term, we are targeting the next 1 million acres through this bond coupled with strong philanthropic support. This will deliver crucial benefits to our national effort to address climate change and improve rural economies â\\x80\\x93 something tangible and permanent that we can do today.  John Gilbert: By buying at-risk forests and holding them on our balance sheet, we can buy time for permanent conservation outcomes. Usually that involves one or more public agencies acquiring a conservation easement that locks in the best practices of sustainable forestry, public access and habitat protection while also removing the ability to break up the forest or otherwise develop the land. Once those restrictions are in place, we resell these permanently conserved acres back to the private sector and recycle the proceeds into a new forest project. By protecting the jobs and recreation economies linked to the forests, we are living up to our unique dual charter in the U.S. for both conservation and economic development.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 23 September 2019  Online payments are quickly dethroning cash as king across Asia. We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Geddes Johnson to discuss the untapped opportunities â\\x80\\x93and latest misconceptions â\\x80\\x93 within Asiaâ\\x80\\x99s payments landscape.  In your role in Investment Banking, you spend a lot of time speaking with clients who are interested in investing in the region. What have you learned about the evolving landscape?  Geddes Johnson: Simplistically speaking, we segment the payments landscape into consumer-facing payments, namely digital or mobile wallets, and merchant-facing payments, such as processing. We also view Asia as three separate and distinct markets: China, India and Southeast Asia. Many clients, however, tend to focus solely on consumer payments in China, often concluding there is little room for new entrants across the region. While we agree the consumer-facing Chinese digital payments market, at this point, has extremely high barriers to entry, there remains ample opportunity and room for multiple winners across the region, especially in merchant services. Furthermore, what works in China may not necessarily work in Vietnam or in any of the other countries across Asia given that demographics and regulatory factors are driving differentiation across country-specific payment ecosystems. Bottom line: We view the success of certain consumer facing wallets, in China and elsewhere, as reflective of the magnitude of the broader opportunity instead of as a barrier to entry.   From a payments perspective, how different are each of these markets?   Geddes Johnson: Overall, successful mobile wallets represent a uniquely Asian phenomenon, but the factors driving the pace of adoption among countries vary. In Southeast Asia â\\x80\\x93 which is made up of six different countries â\\x80\\x93 mobile wallets are gaining traction among a young and digitally native demographic. Nearly 60% of the population is younger than 34 years old and 150 million people will enter the workforce in the next 15 years, which will fuel payment volumes and opportunities to cross-sell digital financial services. But the absence of a uniform licensing regime has prevented the emergence of a true pan-regional player so the â\\x80\\x9carms raceâ\\x80\\x9d for market share is just beginning. In fact, the macro and demographic tailwinds are pushing market evolution faster than regulators can keep up.  Meanwhile, India â\\x80\\x93 a country with an estimated 1.4 billion people â\\x80\\x93 has created a public digital infrastructure, including a biometric database of more than a billion citizens, in an effort to accelerate the companyâ\\x80\\x99s tech sector and help to lower the cost of access to financial services. Furthermore, and importantly, the market is accessible to foreign investors. As a result, global companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, among others, have rushed to set up shop in India, building payments ecosystems atop the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s digital framework to strengthen the stickiness of their respective offerings. At the same time, hundreds of millions of Indians are shifting online and starting to transact for the first time, thanks to plummeting prices for data and smartphones, which have fallen approximately 95% and 33%, respectively, in three years. In some respects, India serves as a petri dish for the bottom-up development of a digital fintech ecosystem. It will be fascinating to see how it plays out.  Lastly, in China â\\x80\\x93 where nearly 70% of the population has a smartphone â\\x80\\x93 consumers are paying for nearly everything with their phones and QR codes. China has leapfrogged checks and cards, going straight from cash to mobile. That said, it can be challenging to create a meaningful presence in the China given the consumer focus and geopolitical landscape. From a corporate perspective, there are also limits on how much foreign companies can own, making partnerships and joint ventures with local fintech companies an attractive option.  Where do you see the most opportunity?  Geddes Johnson: We are spending a lot of time thinking about the merchant payments opportunity which packages core payments acceptance with a suite of other merchant services, such as payroll and tax solutions. The merchant payments model, popularized by the likes of Square and others in the US, is relatively nascent â\\x80\\x93 even nonexistent â\\x80\\x93 across Asia. For instance, small- to medium-sized businesses in the region may not be ready to add payroll software or tax solutions, but many can benefit by accepting mobile payments from retail consumers, or the ability to advertise or lend online. Consider this: Square works with more than 2 million merchants and processed nearly $50 billion in volumes the first half of this year â\\x80\\x93 and currently has a $25 billion market cap. But in China, one of the leading, public independent payment service providers, Huifu, reaches more than 7 million merchants and processed over RMB1 trillion in volumes (approximately US$150 billion) over the same period, yet is valued at less than $600 million. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a massive gap in valuation which we believe highlights an opportunity that many of these companies across the entire region have, which is to build out a merchant services offering anchored by a payment product.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 16 September 2019  Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s capital markets reform spread to new fronts this summer with the launch of the Science Technology Innovation Board. The Nasdaq-like stock exchange for emerging companiesâ\\x80\\x94dubbed the â\\x80\\x9cSTARâ\\x80\\x9d marketâ\\x80\\x94has seen its shares rise over 140% since the first IPOs in July. Below, Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Kinger Lau discusses what distinguishes this market and its applicants, as well as what to expect in the way of foreign access.  Kinger, start us off with the big picture: Why did China develop the STAR market?   Kinger Lau: We think the new exchange was designed to help meet a few overarching policy objectives. One is to broaden the capital-raising channels available to private companies, specifically those in high-tech or high-value industries that can help China with its ongoing shift to a quality-focused growth model. Think of companies in innovative areas like artificial intelligence, big data, advanced semiconductorsâ\\x80\\x94these are the types of firms we expect STAR to give priority to when reviewing IPO applications, and weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen early evidence of this with the first few listings. Beyond broadening market composition, we think another goal of the STAR board is to test out a host of capital market reforms. This is a market that can act as a sort of â\\x80\\x9cproving groundâ\\x80\\x9d for potential liberalization measures before China considers rolling them out in its more established markets.  Tell us more about the reforms under consideration.   KL: Several relate to market access. Unlike Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s other mainland exchanges, which require companies to pass a lengthy approval process before listing, the STAR board is allowing companies to float their shares as long as they satisfy the basic listing requirements. And these requirements are less restrictive than what we see elsewhere in China: for instance, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no revenue or earnings prerequisite, which could help emerging companies like those we discussed earlier make a faster leap to market. And once theyâ\\x80\\x99ve reached the listing stage, companies on the STAR market also will be part of a pilot for market-based pricing and trading activity. Prior to STAR, all domestic IPOs in China effectively listed at or below a valuation cap of 23x price-to-earnings, and they also faced limits on price appreciation in their first few days of trading. The STAR board eliminates these caps in favor of a more market-driven approach.  Many of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s past capital market reforms have focused on opening markets to foreign capital. Is this another step in that direction?    KL: Not directlyâ\\x80\\x94though with STAR applicantsâ\\x80\\x99 strong growth profiles and asset-light operating models, itâ\\x80\\x99s not difficult to imagine STAR companies attracting international interest. For now, this market will be available to foreign investors only through the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors quota system or through proxies. Here, we think ChiNext stocks and mid-caps are probably the closest fundamental comparables to the potential STAR listings from the perspectives of their underlying business profile, size, growth and valuations. So we could see a re-rating and sentiment shift in that direction.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 19 August 2019  Key to any sustainable economic expansion is the growth of an appropriately skilled labor force â\\x80\\x94 something the US has experienced uninterrupted since the global financial crisis. We caught up with Goldman Sachs Research\\'s Abby Joseph Cohen to discuss immigration\\'s contribution to this growth, the subject of her latest report \"Immigration and the US Workforce.\"  Abby, what role has immigration played in shaping today\\'s workforce?  Abby Joseph Cohen: A tremendously important one. If you look back at the last 30 years, the US has seen a robust expansion of its labor force while other developed economies have struggled with declining birthrates and shrinking working-age populations. Nearly half the increase is attributable to foreign-born workers. And it\\'s more than just a numbers story â\\x80\\x93 these workers have proven particularly well-suited to the ongoing shift from a manufacturing to a services economy, now holding an outsized share of the highly-skilled jobs relative to their 17% total share of the US workforce. Going forward, it\\'s widely expected that highly skilled jobs in STEM, health care and financial services will see the most growth â\\x80\\x93 and these are fields where the US hasn\\'t produced enough native-born workers to meet the growing labor demand. So to the extent those trends continue, we\\'d expect the reliance on foreign-born workers to continue, as well.  In your report, you also note some interesting stats on immigrants\\' contributions to research and innovation. What has the record been so far?  AJC: I\\'ll first point to a recent US government study, which found that high-tech immigrant-owned businesses scored higher than native peers on almost all innovation measures, including higher propensity to engage in innovation and R&D. And anecdotally speaking, we see foreign-born workers reaching some of the highest levels of achievement in terms of their economic and cultural contributions. Roughly 45% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children, and more than half of the US Nobel laureates from the last five years were born abroad.  What about earnings potential for foreign-born workers in the US â\\x80\\x93 can joining the workforce be a mutually beneficial relationship?  AJC: In highly skilled fields, yes, partly because US immigration policy encourages it. Foreign workers are required to possess advanced degrees or high-demand skills to secure legal permanent resident status or temporary specialty visas, and as a result, they tend to be concentrated in more specialized, higher-earning positions. In STEM fields like computer science, physical science, and engineering, for example, we\\'ve found earnings potential is 15% to 25% higher on average for immigrants than for native peers. But the story is very different once you move into the low-skilled occupations. Here, foreign workers earn 15% to 30% less, which may be attributed to a lack of English proficiency, and in some cases, legal working status. It\\'s worth noting however that prospects do improve across the board for the next generation, with the children of foreign-born workers tending to be better educated and higher earning than their parents.  So how do you see the story evolving from here? Do you think we\\'ll continue to see foreign-born workers grow their role in the highly skilled fields?  AJC: I think demographics will require it, but ultimately, it all depends on the direction of policy. In recent years, we\\'ve seen declines in the number of permanent resident status \"green cards\" awarded for employment preferences, and we\\'ve also seen declines in the number of temporary visas granted to international students and specialized workers. If these trends were to continue, it could hurt the US\\' ability to attract and retain talent and, by extension, its ability to innovate and compete globally.   READ REPORT'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 12 August 2019  Eight years after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Japan has diversified its energy supply through its investment in renewables. We sat down with Toru Inoue in Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Investment Banking Division to discuss the implications for investors and the energy landscape.  Tell us a little about the renewables space in Japan.  Toru Inoue: Japanâ\\x80\\x99s clean-energy capacity has grown exponentially in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which triggered a nuclear accident in Fukushima prefecture. The accident highlighted the need for an alternative to nuclear energy and jump-started renewables in a way that was previously unimaginable. As nuclear power plants nationwide were taken offline, the country set out to aggressively increase the proportion of renewables in its energy mix by introducing generous feed-in tariffs â\\x80\\x93 or long-term contracts with renewable energy producers that are designed to accelerate investment. Startup ventures and developers globally piled in alongside major Japanese corporations to help the country build capacity quickly. Solar sector growth has been particularly strong, with a nearly 70-fold increase in installed capacity, from 550 megawatts in 2011 â\\x80\\x93 the year before the new incentives went into effect â\\x80\\x93 to almost 38 gigawatts at the end of 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg NEF.  How has this growth in renewables been financed?  Toru Inoue: Since banks have traditionally dominated the corporate-finance sector in Japan, a companyâ\\x80\\x99s ability to access credit often depended on having friendly relationships with local lenders. This has been true even in the infrastructure sector, despite the fact that infrastructure projects often require financing over a term longer than most banks are prepared to lend. As a result, these projects require frequent refinancing, creating additional costs and complexity since interest rates reset with each refinancing.  The renewables boom, however, has been a catalyst for change. Overseas developers struggled to secure financing without local connections or corporate guarantees since Japanese banks werenâ\\x80\\x99t sure how to price loans for these products. â\\x80\\x9cNon-recourseâ\\x80\\x9d debt â\\x80\\x93 which is secured only with collateral â\\x80\\x93 and green project bonds in particular emerged as potential solutions. A common means of financing infrastructure in North America and Europe, this debt is repaid purely from the cash flows generated by a given project. In this way, renewables have unlocked a long-awaited opportunity to connect infrastructure investment with capital market investors in Japan.  Who is investing in this non-recourse debt?  Toru Inoue: Japanese life insurers were the first to favor this new asset class as the long-term nature of infrastructure financing dovetails with these investorsâ\\x80\\x99 need to fund large portfolios of long-term liabilities comprised of their customersâ\\x80\\x99 life insurance policies. Interestingly, Japanese regional banks have also become purchasers, which reflects their appetite for stable, yen-denominated yields amid Japanâ\\x80\\x99s zero-interest rate environment and sluggish loan demand. As renewable-energy plants tend to be located outside of the big cities, being able to support a local enterprise is another draw for these regional lenders.  More recently, pension funds have also started to show interest. They initially took a wait-and-see attitude because they needed a certain level of liquidity. Now, given that five years have passed since Japan Renewable Energy â\\x80\\x93 one of Japanâ\\x80\\x99s largest renewable energy companies â\\x80\\x93 issued Japanâ\\x80\\x99s first green-project bond, the market is sufficiently liquid and deep enough for these influential investors to consider making an entry.  How do you see renewables and their financing developing in Japan going forward?  Toru Inoue: From a demand perspective, Japanâ\\x80\\x99s clean-energy needs look set to increase on the back of a national goal to raise the share of renewables in the fiscal year 2030 power-supply mix to 22% to 24%, compared with 16% as of 2017. In addition to solar, offshore wind power development looks set to accelerate on the back of new legislation. However, cost reduction is a priority as feed-in tariffs have been slashed to less than half their initial levels, and look likely to be withdrawn completely in the near future. New risks have also emerged: Issues with congestion in the electricity grid, for example, have given rise to â\\x80\\x9ccurtailment riskâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 the possibility that grid operators force renewable electricity producers to curtail their output in order to balance supply and demand, which hurts operator cash flows.  This is a natural development as the sector is simply becoming more sophisticated at all levels. The lower feed-in tariffs have accelerated professionalization among operators; new projects are still feasible and financing is available but only the most astute and experienced developers can survive under the new regime. There is also demand for financial products that address the emergent risks, and for solutions for developers looking to exit their existing investments.  One thing that is clear is the enduring demand among Japanese institutional investors for this renewable infrastructure-related debt. The experience of the past five years has helped them get comfortable with the asset class. For example, despite the difficulty of quantifying curtailment risk, JA Solar Japan had no problem selling a new type of project bond that addressed this issue through stress testing and a staggered set of early repayment triggers. Going forward, we expect developers will enjoy an increasingly conducive funding environment, as the growing, global trend towards Environment, Social, and Governance investment adds to the appeal of renewable-energy debt products.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 05 August 2019  How can artificial intelligence impact the workplace of the future? At the Ayco InnerCircle conference, which brings together practitioners and thought leaders in the human resources industry, Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Joe LeRoy of Aycoâ\\x80\\x99s Institutional Business Solutions, spoke with Richard Hughes of UnitedHealth Group, Jeffrey Howell of Panasonic Industrial Devices Sales Company of America and Brian Marcotte of the National Business Group on Health, about the role of AI in their businesses.  Joe LeRoy: AI is having an outsized impact on companiesâ\\x80\\x99 human resources departments. According to PwC, about 63% of companies are rethinking the role of their HR department in light of AIâ\\x80\\x99s impact. Just how pervasive is it?  Jeffrey Howell: From a standpoint of AI, I think the best word that comes to mind would probably be â\\x80\\x9cinevitability.â\\x80\\x9d It is coming whether we like it or not. In 2019, according to one industry stat, an estimated $30 billion to $40 billion will be spent on AI technology in 2019 â\\x80\\x93 thatâ\\x80\\x99s up about 40% from last year.  Richard Hughes: In its current state, AI would be better described as â\\x80\\x9caugmentedâ\\x80\\x9d intelligence where human engagement is still needed in order for AI to reach its potential. AI is not currently capable of the creative, imaginative thinking we associate with the human mind. Rather, we see it as a system for ingesting human engagement and driving outcomes based on observations.  Brian Marcotte: When I think about AI, itâ\\x80\\x99s more of an umbrella term that encompasses machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing and other methods to reach smart decisions. Itâ\\x80\\x99s behind a lot more of what we do and see. In healthcare, for example, itâ\\x80\\x99s everywhere. AI is being used in back-end administration, wearables and are helping to steer people to the right physicians. It will revolutionize how healthcare is delivered. But having said that, the level of change in health care is far outpacing the localized and fragmented delivery systemâ\\x80\\x99s ability to keep up. While there are emerging remedies to integrate these fragmented services, including better data integration and more predictive analytics and actionable messaging to patients, we are in the early stages and they are far from mature solutions.  Joe LeRoy: Given AIâ\\x80\\x99s ubiquity, can you talk about how itâ\\x80\\x99s affecting your recruiting and people strategies?  Richard Hughes: AI is already helping our HR professionals at UnitedHealth with employee selection and advancement. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been using AI for more than three years in our recruiting practice to help connect an applicantâ\\x80\\x99s profile with job openings. But weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing more potential in applying AI to understand our own workforce. For example, weâ\\x80\\x99re applying AI algorithms and leveraging the science of our leadership database to identify the characteristics and profiles that make a great leader. This will allow us to identify and groom future potential leaders earlier in their career. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve also developed methods for assessing flight risk potential through the data points that trigger turnover, giving us time to introduce proactive solutions to help mitigate attrition.  Joe LeRoy: Jeff, as head of Panasonicâ\\x80\\x99s industrial sales business, how is AI impacting the business side?  Jeffrey Howell: The amount of data that weâ\\x80\\x99re getting is permeating every aspect of our business relationships. And data is whatâ\\x80\\x99s driving the core of AI by giving us the ability to project, interpret and predict. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been using AI with some of our business partners to obtain more cost transparency and fine-tune our pricing models. Weâ\\x80\\x99re also using similar predictive analytics to enhance our ability to introduce new products to the market. Historically, weâ\\x80\\x99ve introduced about 20 new products a year. Next year, weâ\\x80\\x99ll launch 140 new products because of AI.  Joe LeRoy: And we canâ\\x80\\x99t talk about AI without addressing its ability to replace jobs. How are you viewing the impact of AI on the future workforce?  Brian Marcotte: In the future, AI will significantly transform many job functions, particularly in the administrative space. Some people are going to lose their jobs in the short term, but over the long term, AI has the potential to create more jobs. We need to reskill and redeploy those people who will be negatively impacted by AI and focus on ways to upskill and develop future workers in the necessary skill sets.   Jeffrey Howell: AI is not only automating many of the manual processes, but itâ\\x80\\x99s also reducing operational efficiencies. If you want to look at ways to take advantage of AI, my advice is to put someone in place to take advantage of your data â\\x80\\x93 such as a chief data officer.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 29 July 2019  In recent years, when central banks were embarking on quantitative easing, investors approached cash as an asset class afterthought given the rock-bottom yields. But the end of QE â\\x80\\x93 and the prospect of rate volatility â\\x80\\x93 has reignited investorsâ\\x80\\x99 interest. We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Kathleen Hughes and Christina Kopec who discussed how clients are investing in cash â\\x80\\x93 and why theyâ\\x80\\x99re focused on more than just yield.   Kathleen, as global head of the firmâ\\x80\\x99s Liquidity Client Business, what are some of clientsâ\\x80\\x99 top concerns?  Kathleen Hughes: With the recent turn in dovishness by central banks â\\x80\\x93 and with interest rates likely to stay lower for longer in Europe and drop in the US â\\x80\\x93 clients are rethinking their approach to cash. Investors, for example, are shifting a portion of their overnight cash holdings from money market funds to funds with slightly longer durations to lock in higher yields in anticipation of a rate cut. For our part, weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen clients extend the duration of their cash holdings and pursue a slightly longer â\\x80\\x9cbarbellâ\\x80\\x9d strategy, where they essentially hold a portion of their cash in liquid money market funds and another portion in short-term bond strategies, with duration averaging two years. Previously, we had seen more interest in ultrashort bond strategies, with slightly shorter durations, typically six to 12 months.  Christina Kopec: In addition, the overall yield curve â\\x80\\x93 the gap between shorter- and longer-term interest rates â\\x80\\x93 has flattened and even inverted this year, which has increased focus on the short end of the curve where there has been a tremendous amount of movement. Some investors are moving slightly out the curve due less to a rates view, but more for the credit premium that still exists, which can add return even as rates fall or offset price drops if the curve steepens again. And that said, the amount of spread risk youâ\\x80\\x99re taking is fairly limited given short final maturities.  Market watchers expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its meeting later this week. How are investors thinking about returns on their cash?  Kathleen Hughes: Investors are being more dynamic in how theyâ\\x80\\x99re managing their cash. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re not just letting cash sit idly, but are actively managing their cash to seek returns. Last year, for example, returns on cash beat the returns on nearly every asset class. But itâ\\x80\\x99s not just about yield. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve also seen an uptick in companies looking to manage their cash through an environmental, social and governance lens, especially for tech-focused companies, start-ups and airlines. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s driven by a broader awareness that shareholders, employees and the broader public are judging companies by how â\\x80\\x9cgreenâ\\x80\\x9d they are. There is also growing focus from clients on doing business with women, minority and veteran-owned broker-dealers.  Christina Kopec: Cash is an easy place to start with ESG. Whether youâ\\x80\\x99re holding your cash in a separately managed account â\\x80\\x93 where you can be explicit about your investment criteria â\\x80\\x93 or a mutual fund, weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen more ESG-focused cash strategies. Weâ\\x80\\x99re also seeing product innovation in yield-oriented strategies for institutional and retail investors. Prime institutional money-market funds, which invest in short-term corporate debt, used to be one of the preferred investment vehicles for short-term cash. But a series of regulatory reforms in 2016 â\\x80\\x93 including abandoning a fixed $1 share price and allowing prime funds to impose fees and redemption gates to prevent possible panic selling â\\x80\\x93 made them less popular with corporate treasurers. But the search for yield has spurred some investors to move back into prime funds which are offering slightly higher yields than their counterparts, government money market funds, which maintained their stable net asset values.  Christina, as global head of Liquidity Solutions Product Strategy, can you talk about what youâ\\x80\\x99re seeing in terms of product innovation in the space?  Christina Kopec: Technology is reshaping the cash space just as itâ\\x80\\x99s affecting every other sector. Clients are demanding more transparency into their portfolios and are relying on technology to help them manage their cash at a time when theyâ\\x80\\x99re also dealing with smaller treasury staffs, cost constraints and outdated technologies. For our part, given the increasingly competitive market and strong client demand, we made the strategic decision several years ago to invest in our infrastructure to build out next-generation platform capabilities for our liquidity business. With the push of a button, for example, clients will be able to look across their cash holdings â\\x80\\x93 regardless of the investment manager. The technology will enable clients to execute, trade and analyze their cash more efficiently and cost effectively.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 22 July 2019  Across Asia, companies are getting more serious about sustainability. We sat down with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Sharmini Chetwode, who shared how companies are increasing their disclosures around environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and how investors are integrating ESG into their investing framework.  Sharmini, how is the global landscape for ESG investing evolving?  Sharmini Chetwode: Globally, investors are facing pressure to invest in a socially responsible way. Currently, about $17 trillion â\\x80\\x93 or 20% of global assets under management -- is labelled as ESG integrated and is invested according to the UN-sponsored Principles for Responsible Investing. That percentage is likely to increase given that the UNPRI has recommended that asset managers integrate ESG in at least 50% of their AUM. What was once considered optional for companies to report is now shifting to mandatory. More broadly, integrated ESG reporting â\\x80\\x93 the new normal in Europe â\\x80\\x93 is gradually becoming part of financial reporting in Asia. Excluding China A shares, Asia's Environmental and Social performance is on par with that of the US. However, conclusions on E&S performance from frameworks alone can be erroneous.  How do Asian companies compare to their global peers in disclosing ESG progress?  SC: Asia is keeping pace with â\\x80\\x93 and, in some jurisdictions, outpacing â\\x80\\x93 global averages for disclosures around E&S risks with environmental metrics featuring most prominently in the rise. The drivers for this rise include the UNPRI and the Sustainable Development Goals, set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. We're also seeing an increasing regulatory push toward ESG disclosure in the region. Over the last three years, for example, we've seen a flurry of initiatives in Hong Kong, underscoring its commitment to ESG and a desire to remain at the forefront of global standards. Japan's implementation of the Stewardship Code â\\x80\\x93 which was published in 2014 and revised in 2017 â\\x80\\x93 and the 2015 Corporate Governance Code â\\x80\\x93 which was revised in 2018 -- has forced investors to actively engage with companies to achieve higher returns on equity, capital efficiency and transparency. In India, the Securities and Exchange Board made it mandatory for the country's largest companies to prepare business responsibility reports. Meanwhile, the China Securities Regulatory Commission is requiring heavy polluters to give more detail on emissions and encouraged all listed companies to voluntarily disclose E&S information by the end of 2020.  Youâ\\x80\\x99ve said that ESG data alone is not enough for ESG insight. Why?  SC: The perception that large data sets can reveal ESG risks is different from the reality. We need a deeper understanding of a companyâ\\x80\\x99s business model, geography and strategy. Whether a company is vertically integrated or has a capital intensive business model can influence its E&S performance. High-level sector-relative analysis can be either punitive or flattering for a given company, so the choice of a peer set is important in forming conclusions about E&S performance and longer-term risks. The same is true for the companyâ\\x80\\x99s geographic location and what that implies for access to water, renewable energy and vulnerability to emissions regulation. This is why digging beyond headline numbers is crucial.  What other challenges do investors face in integrating ESG?  SC: The most challenging obstacle is the amount and quality of data. More than 450 ESG metrics are available from major data providers for investors to analyze. Deciding which metrics have the greatest potential to impact the companyâ\\x80\\x99s financial performance is the starting point. From there, investors have to navigate holes in data availability, lagging data, varied reporting nomenclature and inconsistent levels of data assurance. Analyzing the data in the context of the companyâ\\x80\\x99s business model and location can provide a better snapshot of its ESG risks. However, understanding longer-term risks requires an understanding of a companyâ\\x80\\x99s strategy and goals, potential scenarios of environmental and climatic threats, and is also dependent on whether the company has the tools â\\x80\\x93 such as the appropriate skill sets, Board of Directors support and ESG-linked compensation â\\x80\\x93 to integrate ESG into their business. These are key areas of future progress in Asia.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 15 July 2019  Despite weaknesses in South Africaâ\\x80\\x99s economy, improving business confidence and the promise of structural reforms create the potential for higher economic growth rates going forward, according to Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Colin Coleman, the firmâ\\x80\\x99s sub-Saharan Africa head, and Kunal Shah and Ryad Yousuf, who are leading the firmâ\\x80\\x99s market-making expansion into South Africa. We talked with them about the evolving macroeconomic and political landscape in South Africa, as well as the opportunities and challenges for investors.  Colin, youâ\\x80\\x99ve led the firmâ\\x80\\x99s business in South Africa for the last 20 years. Can you explain South Africaâ\\x80\\x99s place in the global investment landscape?  Colin Coleman: To take a step back, itâ\\x80\\x99s important to remember that the African continent represents about 2% of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s GDP and 15% of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s population. South Africaâ\\x80\\x99s economy â\\x80\\x94 running at just under $400 billion GDP â\\x80\\x94 is relatively small by worldâ\\x80\\x99s standards, but its equity and debt markets are deep and liquid, and are a key driver of the continentâ\\x80\\x99s long-term growth potential. For example, the market cap of the JSE, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, is 2.5 times the countryâ\\x80\\x99s GDP at $1 trillion.  In particular, South Africa is home to sophisticated corporations which are ideally placed to play the continentâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cdemographic dividendâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 or the economic growth potential that can result when the share of the working-age population is larger than the non-working-age share of the population. Indeed, there are large populations across Africa that are underserved in products, goods and services and, as a result, represent a huge opportunity for multinationals and South African companies to sell everything from mobile phones, cement and clothing, to beer and machinery. People are also willing to pay more for services they donâ\\x80\\x99t otherwise have, so this creates a positive margin environment for investors. The combination of all these factors makes South Africa a springboard into potentially interesting growth opportunities.  Goldman Sachs is expanding its presence in South Africa with an application for a new banking license and a revenue-sharing agreement with Investec on equities. Why now?  Kunal Shah: As a firm, we explored the possibility of expanding in South Africa over the years. When we analyzed the move again early last year, we felt like this was a good time to take that step. For one, there was political change in South Africa with Cyril Ramaphosa taking over from Jacob Zuma as president last year. Market participants largely expect Ramaphosa to tackle entrenched corruption and implement structural and economic reforms. If heâ\\x80\\x99s successful, that will open up investment and financial market opportunities for us and our clients. In addition, we now have sufficient scale across our global currencies and emerging markets businesses where it makes sense to expand our trading platform to allow us to offer more core banking products, such as South African fixed income, to our global clients.   Colin Coleman: While we have long offered advisory and capital raising services through our investment banking presence and have also managed money for wealthy families and institutional asset managers, we were limited in what we could offer our local client base in South Africa. A banking license will allow us to become a primary dealer and trade with local corporates, as well as provide services in currencies, interest rates and derivatives.  What makes South Africa an attractive opportunity for foreign investors?  Kunal Shah: At a time when central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, are turning increasingly dovish, South Africa is one of the higher-yielding fixed income markets, which makes it an attractive place for global investors searching for yield. South Africa also has significant trade and direct investment links with China so the recent trade truce at the G20 meetings opens up a window of opportunity for investors.  Ryad Yousuf: Typically, government bonds would be the first asset a foreign investor would consider when looking invest into South Africa. Investors can, of course, buy equities, but they would be exposed to more volatility given the company-specific risks. South Africa is also one of the only emerging market country that has a strong common-law system originating from English law. For foreign investors, having a strong rule of law and legal infrastructure typically addresses one of their top concerns about investing in emerging markets. President Ramaphosa is also making a concerted effort to attract foreign direct investment into the region. Earlier this year, for example, we hosted a client conference where Ramaphosa spoke about the opportunities and growth prospects for investment in South Africa. This was a high-profile event where investors had the opportunity to share their thoughts on their hopes for new government policies. In turn, Mr. Ramaphosa and others in his government who attended the conference had the benefit of speaking directly with investors on his plans for the country.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 08 July 2019  As we hit the year\\'s halfway point, investors are faced with an unusual phenomenon in global markets: riskier assets like equities have rallied alongside their safer peers like bonds and gold. Does this mean the asset classes are sending conflicting signals? Not necessarily, says Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Christian Mueller-Glissmann. We sat down with him to discuss this apparent disconnect in risk appetite and the outlook for the second half.     Christian, your indicator measuring investor appetite for risky assets has climbed in recent weeks, yet interest in safe assets has soared at the same time. What do you make of this market behavior?  Christian Mueller-Glissmann: The reason lies partly in the fact that at the moment, the main driver of risk appetite is monetary policy, which boosts demand for both risky and safe assets. Global inflation expectations have decreased amid a rising emphasis on risks to economic growth, causing central banks around the globe to turn more dovish. Investors are expecting interest-rate cuts, and so are searching for yield anywhere they can find it. This has also driven an unusual gap between the S&P 500, which is hovering near all-time highs, and global 10-year bond yields that are heading towards all-time lows. Interestingly, the leaders within equities -- and risky assets more broadly -- have been defensive plays. For instance, low-volatility stocks in the S&P 500 have posted one of the best performances across assets and in history year-to-date.  How do different asset classes usually behave during monetary easing cycles?  CMG: We just upgraded bonds to neutral over a three-month horizon given that historically, bond yields tend to continue falling after the Fed cuts for the first time. But the performance of risky assets during easing cycles ultimately comes down to economic growth. Growth needs to take over as the main driver of risk appetite before a sustained cyclical rotation within and across assets becomes more likely, but global growth has continued to soften.  Will global growth pick up in the second half?  CMG: Our economists think a recovery is still likely, especially given that data has disappointed in recent months and financial conditions are easing. While there are plenty of risks to this view from both a political and policy standpoint, the pick-up should drive a rotation into more cyclical areas of the market. Still, the fact that we\\'ve experienced a \"bull market in everything\" means multi-asset portfolios will likely deliver lower returns and run the risk of not being well-diversified, so we remain overweight cash over 12 months.  What are your asset allocation preferences for the second half of the year?  CMG: In the near term, markets remain vulnerable to rate and growth shocks, which could be triggered by weaker data or political risks like an escalation in trade tensions. As a result, we remain relatively neutral on risk over the next 3 months. We are looking to add some risk into year-end, however -- we are overweight equities, neutral on credit and commodities, and underweight bonds over a 12-month horizon. More specifically, we would lean towards selective cyclical pockets of growth and avoid very defensive parts of the market, which have done very well this year.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 01 July 2019  The race to roll out 5G networks is accelerating across the globe, with US-China trade tensions putting equipment makers in the spotlight. For China, the transition to faster wireless should bring a wave of opportunities for technology stocks, from increased semiconductor demand to a surge in consumer device upgrades, says Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Allen Chang. We sat down with him to learn more about the scope of the opportunity and how trade tensions could impact rollout.    Letâ\\x80\\x99s start with your view on 5Gâ\\x80\\x99s impact on the smartphones market. How do you see that impact evolving over the next few years?  Allen Chang: Strong consumer demand for 5Gâ\\x80\\x99s high speeds and fierce competition between brands to offer upgraded features should support a ramp-up in 5G smartphone shipments over the next few years. That said, our shipment assumptions are more conservative than the industry estimates, mostly due to concerns over the high price of 5G devices and services in the initial period as well as the limited commercial availability of 5G networks before mid-2020. While we expect China to boast 4.9 million 5G base stations by 2030, consumers might be discouraged from upgrading if 5G reception is limited to certain areas.  You are positive on 5Gâ\\x80\\x99s influence on the telecom equipment sector. Why?  AC: 5G is helping kick off a new investment cycle for wireless infrastructure in the region. We expect China to invest more than $150 billion its 5G network through 2025, with 5G wireless systems accounting for three quarters of the mix. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s more than the countryâ\\x80\\x99s $100 billion investment in 4G from 2013 to 2018, an increase driven in large part by the higher number of 5G base stations and higher initial cost of 5G equipment.  How else will this upgrade cycle differ from the move from 3G to 4G?  AC: You saw 3G boosting the internet experience and 4G further enhancing it, especially the video experience. Next-generation 5G will upgrade data speeds, enabling multi-party video calls and augmented-reality calls, and help expand mobile cloud services. We think the 5G upgrade cycle will be more widespread. The speed of data transmissions means 5G will extend beyond smartphones into multiple sectors, including the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, robotics, drones, autonomous driving, smart factories, smart cities and smart homes. This wide range of potential applications should encourage numerous, differentiated parties to participate in 5G development.  What about trade tensions? Assuming the US maintains its restrictions on trading 5G related technologies with China, how could that affect rollout?    AC: From our view, the US-China trade tensions could potentially drive new dynamics in the competitive landscape in part by narrowing the addressable market for Chinese brands overseas and intensifying their competition in those countries with better trade relationships with China. Should trade tensions further escalate, China could see potential delays in its own fifth-generation rollout â\\x80\\x93 although the long-term structural upgrade to 5G remains intact. So all in all, we think this is a case where the transition would be delayed, not derailed by trade tensions.  Shifting back to the opportunities--how will the introduction of 5G affect demand for semiconductors?  AC: Telecom operators, equipment makers, and devices makers will all likely boost their demand for semiconductor chips in the coming years as they look to upgrade their systems and technology for the 5G era. Advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, electric vehicles and autonomous driving should also support this growing demand. While we acknowledge near-term weakness due to elevated inventory levels across the IT supply chain, we are confident in the long-term growth outlook.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 24 June 2019  In a trend that has reshaped the financial landscape, private markets continue to gain traction as a popular alternative for companies to raise money. Mike Voris and Lyle Schwartz, who lead Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 equity private placements business globally, recently shared their views on the drivers and implications for both companies and investors.  Whatâ\\x80\\x99s fueling the growth in private fundraising?  Mike Voris: In the last few years, a massive amount of capital has flowed into the private market â\\x80\\x93 particularly for mid-to-late stage companies that historically would have relied on an initial public offering to fuel growth. This increase in capital has allowed companies to stay private longer without the burdens of going public and it has also helped contribute to meaningful value creation.  A recent McKinsey report estimated that between $250 billion to $300 billion was invested in private companies in 2018, with 25 companies raising over $1 billion.  Lyle Schwartz: Investors are increasingly comfortable with -- and excited about -- investing in companies earlier in their lifecycles. And companies get access to a broad and diversified investor base that can include corporates, hedge funds, mutual funds, family offices, private equity and venture capital funds, as well as sovereign wealth funds. As a result, these early stage companies are generally no longer beholden to any one investor type that will determine the direction of the company.  What are the most common ways that investors access the private markets? How is that growth affecting market structure?  MV: Private placements make up the vast majority of private market transactions, although there are some emerging areas such as initial coin offerings and crowdfunding that receive press coverage. Basically, a private placement is the sale of an unregistered security â\\x80\\x93 typically an equity or equity-related instrument â\\x80\\x93 in a company thatâ\\x80\\x99s not yet publically traded. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a material increase in recent private placement activity. In fact, in the first five months of this year, weâ\\x80\\x99ve led nine deals, raising $3.5 billion in growth capital, and our year-to-date volume has already surpassed last yearâ\\x80\\x99s levels.  More broadly, the dynamic between the public and private markets has shifted such that more of the valuation gains are happening in the private markets. Our colleagues in Goldman Sachs Research have estimated that on an absolute basis, annualized private market gains for companies going public over the last five years was 30+% higher when compared to the last 25 years. In fact, weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen cases where companies have been able to raise several mega-rounds with significant valuation step-ups to take advantage of this strong market. This, in turn, is leading to a â\\x80\\x9csuper cycleâ\\x80\\x9d of IPOs, especially in the tech sector, where companies going public are significantly larger than in the past.  LS: Global activity is accelerating, as private market fundraising has become increasingly diversified â\\x80\\x93 both across industry sectors and geographically. Europe now has over 60 unicorns measured at the end of 2018 more than seven times the number just five years ago, primarily in the technology, software, fintech, mobility and healthcare sectors. Investors are also engaging in cross-border transactions with non-US investors interested in private placements in US companies and vice versa.  With companies staying private for longer, how does that affect investorsâ\\x80\\x99 ability to get their cash back?  LS: Itâ\\x80\\x99s true that investors are taking a â\\x80\\x9cliquidity discountâ\\x80\\x9d by tying up their money for a set period in exchange for access to potentially high-growth opportunities. And as more investors allocate money to private investments over public ones, thatâ\\x80\\x99s bound to have an impact on overall market liquidity. But from an investorsâ\\x80\\x99 perspective, private market investments can help diversify their portfolios because they are largely non-correlated to the public markets. At the end of last year, for example, when the markets were selling off, people in private investments experienced far less realized volatility.  MV: The structural changes in the private markets are also creating a boom in secondary transactions for pre-IPO liquidity â\\x80\\x93 especially for VC firms that have been invested in a company for 7+ years, but also for founders and employees who want to access liquidity earlier. In the last 12 months, for example, weâ\\x80\\x99ve led secondary transactions for Credit Karma, TransferWise and Workfront.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 17 June 2019  Amid the growth of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, the private sector is increasingly looking to harness capital markets to finance positive social outcomes. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs hosted a roundtable in Paris with investors, issuers and ratings agencies to discuss the opportunities and challenges in the nascent social bonds market. We sat down with Goldman Sachsâ\\x80\\x99 Ivan Fillon, Kathleen Hughes, Marc dâ\\x80\\x99Andlau and Kyung-Ah Park to discuss the takeaways from the event.   First, what is a social bond and its role in the capital markets?   Ivan Fillon: Social bonds are essentially bonds that are exclusively used to finance eligible projects that have positive social outcomes. Unlike green bonds â\\x80\\x94 whose proceeds are earmarked for climate and environmental projects â\\x80\\x94 social bonds raise funds for a broad range of projects that result in positive social benefits, ranging from projects that aim to improve access to health care, education and affordable housing, to initiatives that create jobs or revitalize economically depressed areas. For example, late last year Goldman Sachs advised Groupe BPCE, Franceâ\\x80\\x99s second-largest banking group, on its inaugural â\\x82¬1.25 billion social bonds to provide financing to small businesses and nonprofits focused on local economic development in underserved areas of France. From a capital markets perspective, primary issuance of social bonds is relatively limited â\\x80\\x93 just as green bonds were several years ago â\\x80\\x93 given that the market for social bonds is relatively new. Indeed, having a diverse range of issuers, including corporations, issuing social and sustainability bonds will be critical to creating a deep and liquid market.  What are the factors driving interest in social bonds?   Kathleen Hughes: In recent years, companies have taken on a more active role in using their influence and resources to drive and promote social change. Part of that stems from the pressure they face from their investors, clients and customers, and their employees to be good corporate citizens.  In our investment management business, for example, our clients are asking us to engage with companies that fail to integrate ESG practices into their businesses. Meanwhile, being ESG friendly also provides a competitive advantage for companies â\\x80\\x93 whether itâ\\x80\\x99s in capturing growth and innovation, driving change in their supply chain, or aligning capital raising and investment with ESG.  It also helps employers attract top talent since many millennials often prefer to work with socially responsible and mission-driven companies.   What is likely to promote â\\x80\\x93 and hinder â\\x80\\x93 the development of social bonds?  Marc dâ\\x80\\x99Andlau: The growth of green bonds has paved the way for social bonds, which is benefiting from increasing demand for ESG assets more broadly. Having said that, from an investor perspective, the impact of social bonds is more difficult to measure and quantify given the breadth of social projects, and the complexities around the target populations and market segments. By comparison, green bonds have more specific quantifiable metrics, such as greenhouse gas emissions targets. We have seen some recent efforts to provide an investment framework around social bonds. The International Capital Market Associationâ\\x80\\x99s Social Bond Principles, for example, provided high-level categories for eligible social projects, while also promoting guidelines around transparency, disclosure and reporting to help facilitate the tracking of funds into social projects. But thereâ\\x80\\x99s still more work to be done to create transparency around social bonds and, more broadly, ESG ratings and standards.  What does the future look like for the social bonds market?  Kyung-Ah Park: Despite some of the hurdles that Marc touched upon, weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing greater appetite by market participants to allocate capital to social projects and sustainability initiatives. For example, global social bond issuance increased by 41% to $11.1 billion in 2018, while industrywide issuance of sustainability bonds (which include both environment and social benefits) increased by 38% to $13.7 billion over the same period, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. More broadly, weâ\\x80\\x99re also seeing efforts to demonstrate that returns of financial instruments are linked to ESG performance indicators â\\x80\\x93 which is a sign of the evolution and growing sophistication of the market.  Integrating ESG into companiesâ\\x80\\x99 core business strategies â\\x80\\x93 and showing how doing so drives financial resiliency and improved credit ratings -- will be an important step in the marketâ\\x80\\x99s evolution.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 10 June 2019  Once lofty expectations for an electric-car future may have been temporarily scaled back, but the adoption of hybrid vehicles is continuing to accelerate. We sat down with Goldman Sachs Researchâ\\x80\\x99s Kota Yuzawa who explained why companies are investing in their hybrid technologies before EVs take off in earnest.  Kota, youâ\\x80\\x99ve said hybrids are going to prove more than a passing fad on the road to fully electric vehicle adoption. Why?  Kota Yuzawa: One of the biggest hurdles is the cost of batteries. Battery costs need to fall below US $100-per-kWh for fully electric vehicles to gain broader consumer acceptance. In the interim, we believe companies will focus on selling hybrids and plug-in hybrids as the most practical and profitable technology. Governments around the world, in fact, are replacing their electric vehicle policies with policies for â\\x80\\x9celectrifiedâ\\x80\\x9d or hybrid vehicles that are viewed as more practical than fully electric vehicles. In our view, this should keep the hybrid movement in the mainstream of vehicle electrification for at least the next 10 years. We now expect electrified or hybrid vehicles to account for 35% of global auto sales by 2030.  Why is it taking so long for automotive battery costs to decline?  KY: Innovations have yet to reduce auto battery costs. Even in China, where lithium-ion battery production capacity continues to increase, the per-kWh battery cost was still US$175 at the end of 2018. While the fixed-cost portion that makes up one-third of the battery cost continues to decline with mass production, reducing the remaining variable costs is much harder because you have to increase the batteriesâ\\x80\\x99 energy density. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s very difficult because of the batteriesâ\\x80\\x99 reliance on high-nickel cathodes, so considerable care has to be taken to ensure that appropriate levels of safety and durability for automotive applications are met. Even if battery costs reach the level at which EV adoption accelerates â\\x80\\x93and that key hurdle is US$100/kWh-- there are still concerns about future battery deterioration.   How do you expect the adoption of electrified vehicles to vary across geographies?  KY: Adoption of hybrid vehicles is likely to accelerate in Europe which recently tightened its already strict environmental regulations. Automakers could be hit with massive fines for missing the EUâ\\x80\\x99s fleet CO2 emissions reduction target that starts to take effect next year. In China, the worldâ\\x80\\x99s largest EV market, the government is pushing ahead with its new energy vehicle or NEV policy by sharply reducing current NEV purchase subsidies. So instead of offering the subsidies as a â\\x80\\x9ccarrot,â\\x80\\x9d the government is moving to a â\\x80\\x9cstickâ\\x80\\x9d approach with regulations that require automakers to sell a certain number of EVs â\\x80\\x94 even if they lose money â\\x80\\x93 or get hit with penalties. Japan is aiming for a gradual shift to electrification, with balanced adoption of several powertrains including hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles. Electrification in the US, on the other hand, could slow given a rollback in environmental regulations and efficiency standards.  What other factors could help or hinder broader adoption of EVs?  KY: In general, government incentives and lower costs are factors that help drive EV adoption. Some Northern European countries, for example, are promoting EVs as part of their environmental conservation and energy policies, while aiming to nurture their own auto industries. China is trying to limit the number of new vehicles on the road by imposing strict license plate quotas â\\x80\\x93 but is making an exception for electric vehicles. NEV buyers in China can also recoup the costs of buying their cars in less than three years with monetary benefits.  To be sure, government policies are still a wildcard, and more broadly, the proliferation of EVs could create tight supply/demand conditions for natural resources, including lithium, cobalt, and nickel. A doubling in prices of raw materials would likely drive up battery prices by 15%. Also, we think EVs will likely proliferate only if they can provide users with a better experience than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Going forward, manufacturers are likely to focus on continuing to reduce costs and improve satisfaction levels on range and charging times.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The article below is from our BRIEFINGS newsletter of 03 June 2019  Ahead of this week\\'s 23rd annual European Financials Conference in Paris -- one of Goldman Sachs\\' longest-running events in Europe -- we sat down with Jernej Omahen, head of European Financials Research, to discuss the challenges facing Europe\\'s banks and insurers, from earnings pressures, to political and macro uncertainty, to competition from fintech startups.  Jernej, can you describe the current environment for financial services companies across Europe?  Jernej Omahen: The operating environment remains extremely challenging, especially for banks. Concerns continue over whether European banks, especially in some geographies, will be able to increase their profitability above cost of capital, remains. As a consequence, shares of European banks have generally underperformed for more than a year, driven in large part by factors outside management control -- political risks related to Brexit, Italy or EM, with macro slowdown expected in parallel. When you bring it all together, despite banks reporting broadly flat earnings, last year saw the sharpest sector-wide de-rating in the past decade, exceeding that of peak crisis periods of 2010 or 2011.  How are the recent results of the European elections playing into the sector\\'s attractiveness to investors?  JO: Generally, results were ok, but the share price action wasn\\'t. Solid bottom-up results were more than offset by top-down factors. Overall, the financial sector tends to reflect the political and macro reality at any given point in time. It would therefore be unusual to have a robust financial sector, with an optimistic outlook, in a period where political and macro risks are this high.  At last year\\'s conference, the issue of \"European Banking Union Completion\" was central. How much progress has been made since then, especially on common deposit insurance?  JO: Not much. Indeed, as we see it, there has been very limited progress on completing the third pillar of European bank union, the common deposit insurance. The hope now is that as efforts to complete the banking union stall, efforts to complete the European capital markets union intensify. Completing these two projects -- the bank and capital market union -- is required, but obstacles abound. In turn this leads to banks preferring to operate nationally, with pan-European expansion viewed with reluctance, by most bank managers.  What other themes will investors be focused on at the European Financials Conference in Paris this week?  JO: Technology continues to be an important area, with companies working to improve customer experience, strengthen IT capability, increase spend on cybersecurity, whilst striving to reduce non-IT spend. The participation of fintech companies at this year\\'s conference is the largest it\\'s been since we started inviting fintech firms three years ago. It\\'s not surprising that startups are targeting financial services given the importance of technology for the sector, coupled with some of the largest banks continuing cumbersome restructuring processes, which makes them vulnerable to disruption. The challenge for fintech startups in Europe is scale. Especially managing rapid growth to achieve critical scale, whilst navigating the industry\\'s extensive -- and strict -- regulatory and supervisory framework.'}]"

       "'Signs that the U.S. economy is slowing are increasing. A key question is whether it has decelerated enough to bring down inflation without tipping into recession.  Gross domestic product shrank for a second consecutive quarter, according to data reported last week, meeting a common threshold for recession. But it would be â\\x80\\x9cstrangeâ\\x80\\x9d to classify the first six months of the year â\\x80\\x94 a period marked by a booming job market â\\x80\\x94 that way, says David Mericle, chief U.S. economist in Goldman Sachs Research. The National Bureau of Economic Research uses a wide range of criteria to make the official call on whether the U.S. economy has gone into recession.  Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not to say a full-blown downturn couldnâ\\x80\\x99t happen: economists at Goldman see elevated recession risk over the next two years. They expect the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of rate hikes to 50 basis points in September and 25 basis points in November and December, eventually topping out at a rate of 3.25% to 3.5%.  Mericle says there are indications the Fed has managed to temper growth in GDP enough to start rebalancing the labor market and supply and demand within the economy, but it remains to be seen whether that will be enough to slow increases in consumer prices back to the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s 2% goal on a reasonable time horizon. We spoke with Mericle about the latest GDP report and the metrics heâ\\x80\\x99s monitoring to assess the U.S. economy.  Goldman Sachs Research noted last week that the official definition of recession is a judgmental mix of metrics across several variables, most of which continued to expand in the first half of the year. Does that mean you think the U.S. is not in recession?  Yes. Other indicators of economy activity â\\x80\\x94 payroll employment, real personal income net of government transfer payments, and industrial production â\\x80\\x94 grew in the first half of this year. I think it would be strange to classify the first half of the year, a period of significant labor market progress, as a recession.  Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not to say that weâ\\x80\\x99re in the clear â\\x80\\x94 solving the inflation problem without a recession is still going to be challenging â\\x80\\x94 but I donâ\\x80\\x99t think weâ\\x80\\x99ve fallen into a recession yet.    Where did you see signs of strength and weakness in last weekâ\\x80\\x99s GDP report?  My take is that the economy has undergone a needed deceleration to a pace of growth that is below its long-term potential growth rate, but has probably not entered into a recession. We argued at the start of the year that the Fed needed to tighten policy by more than was then anticipated in order to slow growth to a below-potential pace so that supply grows more quickly than demand and the two come back into balance. Thanks to the fiscal and monetary policy tightening that has already been delivered or signalled this year, it appears that weâ\\x80\\x99re now on the desired trajectory.  Digging into the details of the GDP report, consumer spending grew at a 1% rate, which is roughly where weâ\\x80\\x99d like overall GDP growth to be. Residential investment dropped very sharply, which is to be expected when monetary policy tightening raises mortgage rates sharply. Business investment declined in Q2, and while I expect it to start growing again in the second half of this year, weâ\\x80\\x99re keeping a close eye on it because this is the area where we would worry most about the risk that deteriorating business sentiment could depress activity too much, too fast.  Do you think the GDP report will change the thinking at the Fed in regards to interest rates, and has it changed your expectations for Fed policy going forward?  We havenâ\\x80\\x99t changed our forecast. We continue to expect the Fed to slow the pace of tightening at its remaining meetings this year.  Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been expecting that for two reasons. First, we thought theyâ\\x80\\x99d want to move in smaller increments once the level of the funds rate reached, and especially once it exceeded, their estimate of the neutral rate.  Second, we thought that once it became clear that growth is slowing more decisively, Fed officials would start to put more weight on that and shift away from their recent, more single-minded emphasis on the inflation data.  We heard both of these points from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the July Fed meeting. Fed officials are still committed to trying to solve the inflation problem in a gentle way through a gradual rebalancing of supply and demand, and they seem to agree with our assessment that weâ\\x80\\x99re now on a low enough growth trajectory that it makes sense to start preparing to slow the pace of rate hikes to avoid inadvertently overdoing it.  What metrics are you and the team watching closely right now as you monitor the economy?  Big picture, the Fed is aiming to (1) keep economic growth below its long-run potential rate in order to (2) rebalance supply and demand in the labor market and (3) bring down wage growth and inflation. So weâ\\x80\\x99re monitoring measures that tell us how weâ\\x80\\x99re doing on those three goals. So far I would say the activity data broadly suggest weâ\\x80\\x99re doing well on (1), the employment and job openings data suggest weâ\\x80\\x99re off to a very good start on (2) but have further to go, and the wage growth and inflation data suggest we havenâ\\x80\\x99t made convincing progress yet on (3).'"

       " 'content': 'Signs that the U.S. economy is slowing are increasing. A key question is whether it has decelerated enough to bring down inflation without tipping into recession.  Gross domestic product shrank for a second consecutive quarter, according to data reported last week, meeting a common threshold for recession. But it would be â\\x80\\x9cstrangeâ\\x80\\x9d to classify the first six months of the year â\\x80\\x94 a period marked by a booming job market â\\x80\\x94 that way, says David Mericle, chief U.S. economist in Goldman Sachs Research.
