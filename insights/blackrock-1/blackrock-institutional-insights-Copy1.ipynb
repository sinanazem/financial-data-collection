       "  'content': ' We lay out how our strategic asset views are positioned for a new regime of greater macroeconomic and market volatility. The Great Moderation is over The Great Moderation, a period of steady growth and inflation, is over, in our view. Instead, we are in a new regime of heightened macro volatility driven by production constraints - due to post-Covid supply disruptions and labor shortages in the near-term and structural forces such as a bumpy net-zero transition and a rewiring of global supply chains amid geopolitical tensions over a longer horizon. This warrants higher risk premia – the compensation investors want for holding assets - for bonds and equities. We ultimately expect central banks to live with inflation, but only after stalling growth. The result? Persistent inflation amid sharp and short swings in economic activity. End of the Great Moderation Volatility of U.S. GDP and CPI, 1965-2022 Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and Labor Department, with data from Haver Analytics, August 2022. Notes: The chart shows the standard deviation of the annualized quarterly change of U.S. GDP and the Consumer Price Index. More frequent strategic view changes The new regime means strategic views – that typically remain relatively stable – will likely need more frequent adjustments. The investment playbook will also be significantly different than the past. A higher risk premium and worsening macro backdrop lowers our expected equity returns, spurring a reduction in our overweight to the asset class to only a modest preference. We overweight investment grade credit In fixed income, the rising rate environment, higher inflation and elevated debt loads means we go maximum underweight nominal developed market (DM) government bonds. We prefer inflation-linked bonds (now maximum overweight) and credit, particularly investment grade, where we turn overweight for the first time in two years. Overall in duration, our preference for IG credit and inflation-linked bonds offsets our underweight nominal government bonds. Higher risk premia ahead We have adjusted our medium-term estimates of the risk premia for equity and credit markets to better reflect the wider range of macro outcomes ahead. Our new estimates are modestly higher than prior ones reflecting our view that a more volatile world should mean investors demand more compensation to take on risk. Our prior estimates were based on historical prices through the great moderation. We don’t see current levels of macro volatility to persist – yet we don’t see it falling back to pre-pandemic levels. Bumpier net-zero transition factored in Our capital market assumptions (CMAs) incorporate our best, current estimate of how the net-zero transition will unfold. We have revisited our assumptions around the transition in this update yet acknowledge there is great uncertainty around this. A key takeaway of our ongoing work is that we see a bumpier transition than before – manifesting as supply shocks and regional divergences – as economies and sectors such as energy and transportation are reshaped. The upshot: more macro volatility. We will update our views on the transition and strategic investment implications in a paper in coming months. Access all our portfolio construction work on our hub. The new regime is a riskier one than the Great Moderation, in our view. That means investors should demand more compensation for taking the same levels of risk – higher risk premia. Our CMAs and strategic views had already been positioned for a high inflation risk premium – most directly via an overweight to inflation-linked bonds and a long-standing underweight to nominal developed market government bonds. In our latest update, we incorporate the impact of a higher – currently unpriced equity risk premium – that lowers our expected risk-adjusted equity returns at a 10-year horizon. A higher equity risk premium and deteriorating macro backdrop trims our overweight to DM equities to a modest one at +1. We still have a strategic preference for equities for the long term as we see central banks ultimately pivoting to living with some inflation. Another notable change this quarter is that we turn overweight public credit for the first time in more than a year. The colored boxes on the chart on the right below shows our latest strategic preferences compared to our prior views shown by the dots. We think strategic allocations - that typically would have remained relatively stable in a world of low macro and market volatility – will likely need more frequent adjustments. New regime calls for more dynamic strategic allocations Hypothetical U.S. dollar 10-year strategic tilts, August 2022 This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance. Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, August 2022. Notes: The chart shows our asset views on a 10-year view from an unconstrained U.S. dollar perspective against a long-term equilibrium allocation. Global government bonds and EM equity allocations include respective China assets. Income private markets comprise infrastructure debt, direct lending, real estate mezzanine debt and U.S. core real estate. Growth private markets comprise global private equity buyouts and infrastructure equity. Index proxies are listed in the Appendix. The allocation shown is hypothetical and does not represent a real portfolio. It is intended for information purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. 3 factors driving regime change First, production constraints – stemming from a massive shift in spending and labor shortages - are hampering the economy and driving inflation. Over a strategic horizon, we expect structural forces such as a bumpier transition to net zero and a rewiring of global supply chains to contribute to supply shocks. Second, record debt levels mean small changes in interest rates have an outsized impact on governments, households and companies – limiting how far central banks can go in raising rates and forcing them to live with some inflation. Third, we find the politicization of everything – from inflation to climate change to geopolitics – raising the risk of oversimplified policy solutions in a more complex world. The growth-inflation trade-off Policymakers face a tougher trade-off between growth and inflation today than when demand shocks dominated. Monetary policy was more effective in influencing demand – and helped to suppress volatility. It is less suited to supply shocks, in our view, meaning policymakers may face a worse mix of higher output or inflation volatility. Reining inflation comes at a much greater cost to growth. Preserving growth comes with much higher inflation. That is at the crux of the problem central banks are grappling with currently. We see most developed market central banks taking policy into restrictive territory, but ultimately pivoting and choosing to live with some inflation as the cost to growth becomes clear. That’s why we think the volatility of each will be higher in the new regime. We expect inflation to remain above target in the U.S. over the next 5 years. The choppy restart following Covid offered a glimpse of the long-term impact structural supply shocks may have on the economy. A notable example is the net-zero transition, as we now believe it will be bumpier and a bigger drag in coming years than we previously anticipated. There is great uncertainty around how the conundrum facing policymakers gets resolved. Central banks have turned increasingly hawkish to counter elevated inflationary pressures, sparking a sharp repricing higher of expected policy rate paths. That rhetoric has intensified since our last update as policymakers continue to respond to the politics of inflation. We no longer expect central banks to pause at neutral – the level of rates that is neither restrictive or stimulative – even though tighter policy does little to address supply-driven inflation. It does mean growth over the near term suffers as interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy bear the brunt. In our CMAs, we further raise our estimates for the policy path across major central banks that feed directly into our expected returns across asset classes, most notably fixed income. Upgrading credit to overweight We see nominal yields in five years’ time significantly higher than current levels. That repricing is a valuation drag on expected returns for nominal government bonds. We go back to a maximum underweight stance on the asset class and prefer to take duration risk in credit, particularly higher quality investment grade. We turn overweight both IG and high yield (HY) credit in developed markets for the first time in more than two years. Widening credit spreads Widening spreads – partly a reflection of growth fears – have pushed up our expected returns and brightened the risk-reward for credit. Slowing economic growth is a valid risk – yet we don’t expect the kind of deep recession that would cause defaults and downgrades to explode higher and damage the case for credit. In that backdrop, we think higher spreads and higher government bond yields – both drivers of our expected credit returns – make credit an asset class with attractive income potential. An anticipation of wider spreads and higher yields had kept us underweight public credit. Both are now at more attractive levels – and spreads are no longer a drag to returns. The chart on the left below shows how valuation, the impact of higher spot yields and higher expected income have pushed up our expected returns across DM credit markets. We see spreads compressing over a strategic horizon as the economy stabilizes following central bank pivots. We see spreads compressing over time, yet not immediately. Higher inflation Finally in fixed income, we return to a maximum overweight on inflation-protected government bonds. Why? We believe markets are once again underappreciating the persistence of higher inflation. The U.S. inflation breakeven rate fell sharply over the second quarter from its March 2022 peaks – see chart on the right below – due to broader risk-off sentiment and as recession fears took hold. The drop has taken market-implied pricing well below our estimates for forward inflation expectations over the next five years – the yellow dot in the chart. Global equities struggled over the second quarter. Markets have recovered some losses in recent weeks, yet the broad MSCI World index of DM equities is still down 15% year-to-date, according to Refinitiv data as of Aug. 8, 2022. Typically, falling prices would mean we would expect to see higher expected returns as, all else equal, valuations become more attractive. Yet, all else has not remained equal. Markets have grappled with the difficult trade-off that central banks face between choking off growth via sharply higher rates or living with supply-driven inflation. Tough rhetoric from central banks on inflation suggests interest rates – across most of DM – are likely to move past neutral into restrictive territory. Beyond tighter monetary policy, the implications of the energy price shock – particularly painful for Europe – and China’s strict Covid lockdowns are weighing on the near-term economic outlook. Factoring in a growth slowdown The impact of these feed into our equity CMAs and inform our asset preferences by offsetting the boost from lower equity prices. Our estimate of where interest rates may get to has moved higher and the short-term path has steepened as discussed. Higher short-term rates mean a higher discount rate for equities – a drag on valuations that diminishes our expected returns. Also, the near-term outlook for corporate earnings growth has worsened. The chart on the bottom left shows that current earnings are not fully reflecting the deterioration in the underlying growth picture, in our view. We see current consensus earnings expectations as too optimistic and expect downgrades ahead. Higher risk premia We have also modestly increased our estimate of the five-year ahead equity risk premium (ERP). We prefer the ERP as a valuation gauge over PE ratios, as the ERP takes into account both the price earnings in the year ahead and interest rate outlook. PE ratios only consider price and year-ahead earnings. Our prior expectations of the level of ERP in 5 years time were partly informed by historical data from 1995 onwards – the period of the Great Moderation. This is no longer an accurate benchmark for the future, in our view as it does not consider the new regime. Our revised estimates for the U.S. are shown on the chart on the right below. We now assume an ERP of about 4.2% for the U.S. vs. 3.9% earlier. We think this increase in risk premia is justified, with moderately higher volatility over the coming years. Trimming the equity overweight We still prefer equities to bonds in our strategic views, yet trim our stance on equities to a modest overweight of +1. Over a 10-year horizon, we expect some of the market factors roiling equities to wash out. We expect central banks to live with some inflation after the damage to growth and employment from fighting supply-driven inflation starts becoming apparent. We believe that pivot will ultimately be supportive of equities. Yet we also do not expect that central banks will cut rates back down to stimulative levels as inflation is likely to stay stubbornly above their targets. Our lower expected returns for equities – and trimmed overweight – reflects these dynamics. A similar dynamic is at play in growth private markets such as private equity. Valuations here are slow moving, yet are not immune to higher interest rates. We stay modestly underweight. Download PDF report '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Read details of our midyear outlook: The Great Moderation is over The Great Moderation, from mid-1980s until 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, was a remarkable period of stability of both growth and inflation. We were in a demand-driven economy with steadily growing supply. Borrowing binges drove overheating, while collapsing spending drove recessions. Central banks could mitigate both by either raising or cutting rates. That period has ended, in our view. Bracing for volatility This new market environment has echoes of the early 1980s. We are bracing for volatility in this regime. Central banks are rushing to raise rates to contain inflation that’s rooted in production constraints. They are not acknowledging the stark trade-off: crush economic growth or live with inflation. The Fed, for one, is likely to choke off the restart of economic activity - and only change course when the damage emerges. We see this driving high macro and market volatility, with short economic cycles. Equities would suffer if rate hikes trigger a growth downturn. If policymakers tolerate more inflation, bond prices would fall. Either way, the macro backdrop is no longer conducive for a sustained bull market in both stocks and bonds, we believe. We see higher risk premia across the board and think portfolio allocations will need to become more granular and nimble. Living with inflation We think we will be living with inflation. For all the noise about containing inflation, we see policymakers ultimately living with some of it. We remain overweight equities and underweight government bonds in long-term portfolios. We expect investors to demand more compensation to hold long-term bonds in this new regime. We see a high risk of growth stalling and reduce equities to underweight. We now prefer to take risk in credit because we don’t see contained default risk. Positioning for net zero We see the bumpy transition to net-zero carbon emissions shaping the new regime – and believe investors should start positioning for net zero. We think investors can be bullish on both fossil fuels and sustainable assets, as we see a key role for commodities in the transition. Yet our work finds that changing societal preferences can give sustainable assets a return advantage for years to come. Ready to shift views We stay pro-equities on a strategic horizon but are underweight in the short run. Biases built up during the Great Moderation, like buying risk asset dips, won’t work as well as before, in our view. A new regime of greater macro volatility, shorter cycles and more volatile markets, means a dynamic approach to portfolio positioning. Our conviction is that portfolios will need to change more quickly. Ready to shift views Our conviction is that portfolios will need to change more quickly.

       "  'content': ' We see Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a significant and surprising escalation of the conflict. We now know what we are contending with: the start of a protracted stand-off between Russia and the West. We deplore the human toll and tragedy all this may bring. The key macro impact in the short run is higher inflation via rising energy prices, in our view, complicating central banks efforts to curb price pressures. The invasion appears to target regime change in Kyiv and will likely trigger punishing sanctions by the U.S. and its allies. This may include cutting off Russia’s main banks from the world’s financial system and restricting key technology exports. We could also see Western arms and materials supporting any Ukrainian insurgency – and Russian cyberattacks and disinformation. Risk assets have fallen sharply, with U.S. and European equities hitting new lows for the year. Government bond yields have declined but not as much as might be implied by the equity selloff. This shows their diminished appeal as diversifiers in the inflationary environment. Russian assets have been hit hard on the prospect of more sanctions. The key macro impact from this event, in our view, is fast-rising energy prices. This will exacerbate supply-driven inflation - while delaying and raising its peak. We think central banks will need to normalize policy to pre-Covid settings to curb inflation, and they will find it tough to respond to any slowdown in growth: policy rates are headed higher. Central banks ultimately won’t go beyond normalization to rein in inflation, in our view, because of high costs to growth and employment. In other words, we think central banks will live with inflation. They may face less political pressure to contain inflation as the conflict becomes an easy culprit for higher prices. We believe this will allow central banks move more cautiously as they raise rates, especially the European Central Bank. Our conclusion: The invasion has reduced the risk that policymakers slam on the brakes – or that markets think they will. Investment implication: The key to watch is the interplay of energy prices and inflation expectations. We dialed down risk-taking this year because we saw a risk of confusion amid a confluence of unique events: the economic restart, spiking energy prices and new central bank frameworks. This confusion has played out: Market expectations of rate hikes have become overly hawkish, in our view. We were prepared to take advantage of market dislocation, but are holding off on making changes to our tactical views until the interplay dynamics become clearer. For now, we keep favoring equities over bonds at lower risk levels than last year. Download PDF '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Our strategic asset preferences for equities over nominal government bonds and credit have been positioned for the new market regime we flagged in our 2022 Global Outlook. We see this regime being driven by investors demanding greater compensation, or term premium, for the risk of holding government bonds and our expectation for higher inflation in the medium term. It reinforces a significant reallocation to equities and away from government bonds that has only just begun, in our view. Our latest strategic views We are now in a fundamentally different market regime from the one we’ve seen over the past decade – one driven by higher supply-driven inflation and a more muted cumulative central bank response to such inflation. This macro backdrop – already baked into our capital market assumptions (CMAs) - reinforces a significant asset reallocation in favor of equities and away from fixed income that our strategic asset preferences have already been positioned for. The dislocations in markets so far in 2022 - driven by an adjustment to this regime shift and by near-term confusion stemming from the unusual economic restart, a surge in inflation and new central bank frameworks – presents long-term investors with a strategic opportunity to bump up equity allocations. We add to our developed market equity overweight following their year-to-date selloff and keep our strong underweight to nominal government bonds. See the chart on the left below. The speed of the market’s repricing upwards of the path of interest rate hikes over the next two years – most notably at the Fed but also to varying degrees across other major DM central banks such as the European Central Bank (ECB) – has been striking. The swiftness of the move has sparked confusion – exacerbated by mixed messages from central banks themselves – about what is guiding their policy. The Fed appears to have effectively abandoned its prior guidance that it would wait until it reaches its “broad and inclusive” full employment objective before starting to raise rates. In doing so, it has lost an anchor for policy expectations and contributed, in our view, to the speed of the market’s repricing of the rate path over the next two years. The pace of the repricing has weighed on equity markets, adding to some investors’ concerns around slowing growth and potential erosion of profit margins as inflationary pressure build. The confusion gripping markets can persist over the near-term – indeed, the repricing of the ECB\\'s rate path occurred after 24 January cut-off date for this CMA update. On a strategic horizon of five years and beyond, we believe fundamentals will matter more, spurring us to take advantage of the recent selloff add to our DM equity overweight. It is not strange that the central banks should want to get back policy to neutral and away from emergency measures – and do so quickly – as the restart does not require stimulus. Yet we believe what we are seeing for the Fed in particular is a re-timing of rate rises and not a re-assessment of how far rate rises are going to go this cycle. The chart on the top right contrasts market pricing of short-term (orange line) and long-run rate expectations (yellow line). Market expectations and the Fed’s own projections of cumulative rate hikes – key for asset valuations - have remained stable at historically low levels through the repricing at the front-end. We believe central banks will ultimately choose to live with inflation. Why? The unusual supply-driven nature of inflation means fighting such inflation aggressively with monetary policy will dent growth while doing little to address the underlying cause. This suggests a muted policy response that keeps real rates relatively low and supportive of risk assets. We expect supply triggered inflation to last far beyond the restart. Why? We see the transition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 completely rewiring the global economy and altering supply-demand patterns across sectors. We believe bond markets are not fully pricing in higher medium-term inflation. We expect higher term premium to become a driver of higher nominal yields. This is also why we prefer and remain strongly overweight inflation-linked bonds. Our central case is for nominal yields to continue to rise. Yet they remain close enough to lower bounds to limit the effectiveness of DM government bonds as portfolio ballast. Meanwhile, China continues to stand out. In contrast to DM economies, the policy stance in China has become markedly dovish as policymakers look to counter the economic hit from new virus strains amid the Winter Olympics. We remain modestly overweight Chinese assets in strategic allocations, and like Chinese government bonds in particular for both returns and diversification. Download PDF report An opportunity to add to equities Confusion over the restart, new virus strains, supply-driven inflation and new central bank frameworks has been evident in markets through January. Alongside the pace of rates pricing, this confusion has weighed on equity markets. The swift repricing in the path of short rates has sparked a surge in bond yields and triggered a rotation away from long-duration sectors such as tech that have dominated equity markets over the past decade. For long-term investors, we see this selloff as a mispricing to exploit by adding to equity positions. We believe equity markets are not making the distinction between the repricing in the near-term path of policy rates – which has been sharp yet has a limited impact on long-term expected returns – and the muted change in long-run rate expectations – far more important for equity valuations and returns. The value of an equity is based on the future value of cash flows – the vast majority of that value lies beyond 2022 or 2023, in our view. This means a higher discount rate in those years but not further out should, all else equal, have only a limited impact on long-term equity valuations. In our CMAs, certain key sectors – such as tech and communications - have become more attractive now than they were prior to the equity market sell-off, and our higher allocation to equities overall reflects a larger share of these sectors in our portfolios. In a whole-portfolio context, the valuation argument has implications beyond public equities. In our paper the core role of private markets in modern portfolios, we emphasized that prevailing market conditions should dictate the split between public and private assets rather than a pre-determined split. We determine the attractiveness of private versus public markets independently every quarter. The relative attractiveness of public equity, and, as we’ll discuss in the next page the relative unattractiveness of public fixed income influences our private market allocations. Today, we prefer to access credit exposures via private markets, and on a relative basis, prefer to access equity exposures publicly. Importantly, however, our relative underweight to private equity should not be seen as a recommendation to sell private equity allocations or abandon long-standing funding programmes. We believe private growth assets should play a sizeable role in any institutional asset allocation eligible to hold such assets. Yet in a hypothetical scenario of designing a portfolio from scratch today, we believe such assets would play a lesser role than they did due to the increased attractiveness of public equity. The bottom-line: The bigger picture is little changed amid the volatility of the past month. The sum total of expected rate hikes - key for asset valuations - has not moved much. That means publicly traded equities have become even more attractively valued than they were after their recent drop, leading to our upgrade. We find the public equities particularly appealing relative to growth private markets where the repricing we describe above has not occurred, in our view. Download PDF report Lower bounds still matter for bonds Nominal government bonds have become less expensive since our last update, as yields have backed up. Yet we remain convinced in our underweight to nominal DM government bonds even after the backup in yields we have witnessed in recent months. Why? Two key reasons: first, we see yields as being close enough to effective lower bounds that bonds’ role as portfolio ballast remains challenged and second, we believe we are seeing a re-assessment of fixed income risk in markets as term premium – or the extra compensation investors demand to hold long-term bonds – is restored. We believe there is further to go on the term premium, keeping our central estimate for expected returns low. Given the move in yields, a valid question is whether they are sufficiently far away from effective lower bounds for them not to matter. Perhaps yes, for investors focused on short time horizons. But for investors building strategic horizon portfolios, history and our estimates uncertainty around the path of returns going forward suggest not. Take the outlook for the U.S. Treasuries all-maturities index. When building a 10-year portfolio, the question \\'do lower bounds matter?\\' effectively means asking what is the probability of falling around 150 basis points - the current average yield to maturity of the Bloomberg U.S. Treasuries index, as of 24 January 2022 - over the next 10 years. Data from Federal Reserve of St. Louis shows that since 1969 yields were 150 basis points below their starting levels five years later on 36% of the days over the whole period even after accounting for any structural decline in rates over time. See table below. Even when we adjust this data to allow for the structural decline in yields in recent decades, the number is 26%. See the table below. That means based on history alone, we would expect more than a quarter of our return pathways to be impacted by the lower bound over a 10-year horizon.

February 2022.Notes: The table shows the percentage of days yields fell below their starting level by 150 basis points or more from their starting levels over 5- and 10-year rolling periods But historical performance can be thought of as just one of multiple unknown pathways that asset prices might take going forward. The market environment of past few months has underscored the importance of incorporating uncertainty in return estimates – and sharply brought into focus the idea that historical performance may not be much of a guide for future returns. Our approach to portfolio construction is based on achieving resilience in worst-case outcomes. We simulate thousands of potential return pathways around our central estimate and provide a “term structure” of returns over different time horizons – from five years out to the long-term. In our simulations, these worst-case outcomes are ones where risk assets such as equities do poorly. This could be, hypothetically, a recession - a plausible scenario over a 10-year year period. This is precisely when portfolio ballast will be needed. Yet it is in these same simulations where lower bounds on bond yields may be breached as yields fall again in response to accommodative monetary policy that has been employed to counter downturns and market shocks. See our April 2019 paper Understanding uncertainty for more on our approach to incorporating uncertainty. The bottom line: we keep our strong strategic underweight to government bonds even after the recent back-up in yields. Our central case assumes yields keep rising – driven in part by the return of term premium. See the chart below on the right for our estimates of where U.S. Treasury yields will be in five years’ time relative to market estimates. That means our expected returns remain low relative to other asset classes, and the ability of government bonds to act as risk-off diversifiers due to proximity of yields to effective lower bounds over a strategic horizon.

       "  'content': \" Our key themes and the asset recommendations they imply – an overweight in developed market (DM) equities, a high-conviction underweight in DM nominal government bonds and a strong overweight in inflation-linked bonds - have been playing out for the last 18 months. DM equities and inflation-linked bonds have done well while nominal government bonds' performance has been poor. It is appropriate to question whether these views still hold after the strong performance and uncertainty among market participants around inflation and the path ahead for interest rates, plus concern about China’s growth slowdown. We see our themes persisting yet feel it is prudent to stress test our views to gauge just how different the outlook needs to be from our base case to shift our asset preferences. Overall strategic direction Our strategic tilts – a broad preference for equities over credit and inflation-linked bonds over nominal government bonds – have remained stable amid the unusual economic restart. Strong corporate earnings and low real rates have supported equities that remain close to record highs. Yet recent months have been marked by significant volatility - particularly around the interest rate outlook sparked by market uncertainty around central banks' reaction function amid rising inflation, but also around China's slowing growth and supply shocks that have seen energy prices soar globally. Our core investment themes have helped us to cut through the confusion of competing market narratives. We see the central bank policy and nominal yield response to higher inflation to be the most muted it has been in decades. In our view, the U.S. Federal Reserve would already be raising interest rates at current levels of growth and inflation under its old policy framework, highlighting how their reaction function has changed significantly. In our view, key to the path for U.S. interest rates will be how the Fed interprets its full employment mandate. We see interest rates climbing gradually yet real yields staying relatively low – a positive for risk assets and a negative for nominal government bonds. We push back against the notion that higher spot inflation indicates a repeat of 1970s-style stagflation. The growth outlook remains robust, in our view. We believe the unusual supply shocks tied to the restart are driving higher inflation. We expect these imbalances to resolve over the next year yet see some persistence in price pressures – a reflection of central banks’ increased tolerance of inflation overshoots. We estimate U.S. inflation averaging just under 3% over a five- to 10-year horizon. Such a view is already embedded in our CMAs. The expected shift to a higher medium-term inflation regime supports the strong overweight to inflation-linked bonds as shown in the chart below. Our expected returns for inflation-linked bonds are much higher than nominal government bonds due to our views of higher medium-term inflation and the lower valuation drag from yields grinding higher. We see low-yielding nominal bonds as poor portfolio ballasts. We remain overweight Chinese assets. We see Chinese assets as an important source of returns for most globally diversified portfolios. China portfolio allocations have come under scrutiny amid a regulatory clampdown. Our base case already assumes policymakers tighten control of the economy over time as China’s leadership balances social and economic objectives. We assume materially higher uncertainty and higher risk premia for China compared to developed markets in our CMAs. We recognize the path won’t always be smooth but believe investors are being rewarded for the inherent risks. Current allocation to Chinese assets in global portfolios, on average, point to an overly negative economic outlook in coming years, in our view. The new nominal, alongside our two other investment themes - China stands out and the journey to net zero - continue to underpin our views. We believe part of the volatility we have seen over the past quarter is a reminder of the unusually wide range of economic outcomes that potentially lie beyond the restart. It is prudent amid such a macro backdrop to continuously stress test asset preferences should our investment themes unfold less benignly that we currently expect. In this paper, we dig into alternative scenarios involving a spike in nominal yields and a gloomy outlook for China. Over the summer, a supply crunch sparked intense volatility across the energy sector, providing a glimpse of what a disorderly climate transition might look like. Our climate-aware CMAs are predicated on a smooth transition to net-zero world by 2050, which is mildly inflationary and baked into our strategic views. The implications of a disorderly transition present a complex challenge – one we will address in a more detailed research in coming months. What rate path cuts our equity view? The new nominal remains core to our strategic views. The Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have adopted new policy frameworks that explicitly allow for greater inflation tolerance than in the past. We believe this means that interest rates and nominal yields will stay lower for longer. It also points to higher inflation over the medium-term – something that is already baked into our views. In this environment of low real rates and moderately higher inflation, we prefer equities over nominal bonds. In recent months, markets have challenged central banks’ new frameworks by testing their resolve to not lean against the higher spot inflation fuelled by the restart. Surging spot inflation pulled forward market expectations of the first policy rate hikes – or the lift-off - across central banks, notably the Fed. Yet we believe what matters is not the timing of the first hike: a somewhat earlier lift-off is less important than the cumulative increase in rates over the hiking cycle. To really challenge our new nominal would require a steeper policy rate path, more akin to past hiking cycles. We test an alternative scenario of policy rates rising sooner and further to try to estimate just how much higher the path needs to be tip the balance against equities. Our valuation models suggest that short-term cash rates would need to be 80 basis points higher than our current estimates to turn us neutral on equities. The chart on the left below shows 3-month U.S. cash rates with their expected path in our base case and alternative scenario. The alternative scenario would require the Fed react more like it has in the past – and abruptly end the joint monetary and fiscal policy revolution that has brought about massive debt levels and a higher tolerance for inflation. A sharp rise in the path of short rates would hit equity valuations. Our scenario would see our U.S. equity expected returns down around 2%, with a greater impact felt in rate sensitive sectors such as tech that typically have a low equity risk premium (ERP) – our preferred valuation gauge that accounts for earnings growth as well as the rate outlook. Less rate sensitive sectors such as energy that have higher ERPs would fare better. In the alternative scenario, our estimate of the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield remains at 2.5% despite higher cash rates. Why? Central bank tightening drives medium term inflation expectations lower, pushing down our break-even inflation estimates relative to current expectations. Potential portfolio implication: The impact on our strategic asset allocation (SAA) preferences is shown on the right chart. Fixed income assets perceived to be higher quality, such as DM government bonds and investment grade credit, become relatively more attractive, as yield curves flatten more than our base expectations. Yet even in this scenario they remain an underweight – just less so. Inflation-linked bonds would be less of an overweight but still preferable to nominal bonds, given the latter’s low returns and reduced ballast role. Current investment stance: We see the kind of spike higher in short-term rates described above as unlikely. Markets are pricing in short-term rates rising to 1.9% by the end of the decade, according to data from Bloomberg as of November 2021. Our alternative scenario is materially above that at 2.4% by end 2030. We maintain our conviction in our new nominal theme that supports our preference for equities. What China scenario hurts our views? We discussed our strategic preference for Chinese assets in detail in our May 2021 paper The role of Chinese assets. Since then we have had more evidence that the long-term direction of travel for policy in China is likely to be more state intervention. China’s regulatory clampdown on certain industries this year that has weighed on growth and rattled investors in this context is one stark example. In our view, policymakers’ goal with these actions - alongside a relatively hawkish monetary and fiscal policy stance - is for a more equitable economy and higher quality growth, instead of mere quantity. Such a significant shift comes with clear risks to growth. Yet we believe global investors’ low average allocations to China today suggest they hold a particularly pessimistic view on the outlook, prompting a stress test of our views. In our stress test, we assume China derails economically in the form of a sustained, sharp slowdown. We looked to the 2015-16 China growth shock and market reaction as an indication of what such a scenario would look like. Back then, an equity market shock was accompanied by yuan devaluation and widespread fears of a significant growth slowdown. In our alternative scenario we assume such a backdrop persisting over a longer time period – think a Japan post-1990 scenario with an aging population and anaemic growth, rather than a 2008-style crisis. The left chart below shows our expected returns for the MSCI China equity index in the alternative scenario compared to our current expectations. We believe such a backdrop would ultimately bring China bond yields lower - narrowing the yield gap with the U.S. and Europe. It would also drive down Chinese equity valuations as investors demand higher equity risk premium to compensate for greater uncertainty amid slower economic growth that erodes earnings growth. The effects would not be confined to China - a slowdown in China growth would be a drag on global equities and push global bond yields lower, in our view. Potential portfolio implication: The chart on the right shows the potential impact on our asset views. The biggest allocation impact would be a reduction in global equities given the serious, negative implications on global growth and corporate earnings prospects from sharply slower growth in China. The increase in Chinese government bonds appears counterintuitive yet falling yields in an adverse economic outcome would boost the asset class’ expected returns. Our scenario is not one in which China becomes non-investible – it is one where growth slows. This would dent the risk assets such as equities globally and brighten the appeal of all government bonds rather than just those issued by China. Current investment stance: We believe investors’ allocations to Chinese assets today seems like they are already positioned for a scenario where China’s economy derails as described above. The hawkish policy stance and impact of tighter regulations has already spurred a significant underperformance of Chinese and equities and credit markets in 2021. Valuations for Chinese equities have diverged sharply from the U.S. Our estimate of the equity risk premium – our preferred valuation gauge that takes into account prevailing interest rates – stands at 8% for China compared to 4.3% for the U.S, as of end-October. A higher ERP for Chinese equities is warranted in our view given uncertainties, yet we see current valuations painting an overly pessimistic picture. Download report \"},\n",

Emerging markets (EMs) are essential to the transition, but they are starved of capital to fund it. A big emerging question: how can EMs get the investment they need for the net-zero transition?',\n",
       "  'content': ' A decade late, a trillion short This US$1 trillion figure is based on numerous studies of climate finance needs in EMs. Estimates vary depending on the underlying assumptions and given the uncertainties around modelling climate impacts. A 2018 study puts the investment requirement for EMs excluding China at between US$0.4 trillion and US$1.4 trillion per year, while a June 2021 report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), World Bank and World Economic Forum states that over US$1 trillion per year will need to be invested in EMs through 2030 to get them tracking towards net-zero emissions by 2050. Yet these estimates largely focus on the supply-side cost of climate mitigation – that is, the measures to tackle the process of climate change. If we also consider the cost of adaptation (measures to protect against and limit the damage of realized and future climate change) and demand-side costs (such as reducing energy consumption), the figure would be significantly higher. How big is the shortfall? Even taking a conservative view of the investment need, current financing is nowhere near sufficient. In 2020, investment in decarbonization in EMs (excluding China) amounted to just US$150 billion per year – only a sixth of what’s needed. See the chart above. Some of this money comes from EMs themselves, and some is mobilized by DMs via official bilateral and multilateral channels and the private money they leverage. In 2019, DMs mobilized just US$80 billion, according to the latest OECD data. This puts DMs still some way off from meeting their commitment as part of the 2010 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). Their goal is to mobilize, from both public and private sources, at least US$100 billion per year by 2020. Even meeting this pledge won’t get us anywhere close to the at least US$1 trillion we believe is needed. Make-up of DM contribution Breaking down the 2019 DM mobilization total, the vast majority of it (over 80%) was public money, and the overall volume has grown somewhat in recent years, largely delivered in the form of loans. Only a small share of this public money – US$16.7 billion in 2019 – was actually grant-equivalent financing fueled by budgetary resources. This type of financing is crucial because it can be used to directly buy down EM risk and green technology premia. Private money mobilized by DMs declined slightly in 2019 versus 2018 – from an already low level. In 2019 less than 20% - or US$14 billion – came from private sources. But the investment needs of at least US$1 trillion per year are too high to be met by taxpayers alone. The private component needs to be massively scaled up – and rapidly, in our view, given the potential consequences of an underfunded green transition in EMs for the whole world. Unlocking private capital Mismatched resources Distribution of resources and assets in emerging and high-income economies Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, IMF, World Bank, MSCI, using data from Haver Analytics and Refinitiv DataStream, October 2021. Note: The chart shows the shares in different concepts of EMs (excluding China), China and high-income economies (i.e. rest of the world). EMs are those classified as low and middle-income countries by the World Bank. For market cap, this is the share of each group/country in total world stock market capitalization measured by the MSCI world stock market capitalization, as of 4 October 2021. For CO2 emissions, this is the share of each group/country in total world CO2 emissions in 2018 (latest data point). For GDP this is the share of each group/country in world GDP measured using Purchasing Power Parity exchange rates, as of 2019 (before the Covid shock). For population this is the share of each group/country in world population in 2020. Private capital to fund the transition is theoretically plentiful. But current strategies to entice it are not working at sufficient scale and speed. Why not? The EM investment landscape is viewed as high risk – to the point that many private investors are deterred – or prohibited – from investing in EMs. See the chart above. But these are currently undiversifiable risks: the institutional and structural reforms required to de-risk individual countries – though underway in many cases – will not happen quickly enough. No amount of clever financial engineering can address these risks, and existing approaches by multilateral organizations have not succeeded in mobilizing private capital at scale. Measures not working Existing measures to mitigate this risk have not been effective in bringing in private finance at the scale needed. Limits on current efforts to attract private capital Institutional/structural reform takes time DFI risk mitigation measures are deployed on too small a scale Public money is too targeted on funding individual projects instead of reducing broader risk Market failures, e.g. unequal access to information, impede capital flows Existing grants or grant-equivalent finance provided by developed economies is too targeted on funding individual projects – rather than being used to mitigate risks more broadly and crowd in private investment. If the pace and scale of climate flows is to pick up as it needs to, either the input of public budgetary resources needs to increase radically, or the amount of private capital that public support can mobilize will have to rise by an order of magnitude – or a combination of the two. We believe budgetary resources of at least US$100bn a year – about six times current outlays – need to be committed by countries that can afford it. The amount could be reduced if development finance institutions(DFIs) can mobilize more private capital with each dollar of public support than they currently do. But given the timescale and DFIs’ difficulty in mobilizing private capital at scale, we believe the starting point is for governments to significantly scale up budgetary allocations. Averting future losses This money should be used to de-risk projects on the understanding that it might not be seen again, rather than be spent directly on projects looking for a return. This may be seen as a huge cost for DMs, but we believe it represents an essential investment. US$100 billion per year – or US$2 trillion cumulatively over the next 20 years – is only a fraction of the losses averted by a successful climate transition. We estimate a cumulative loss in global economic output of nearly 25% to 2040 – equivalent to more than US$21 trillion of 2019 GDP. Once we move past 2040, we expect the size of avoided economic damages for actions taken now to be substantially higher. To further put this figure in context, US$100 billion per year over 20 years is only a fraction of the US$9 trillion (as at July 2, 2021) of domestic DM fiscal support provided since 2020 to cushion the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Applying the same willingness to roll out material support for climate finance could help close the funding gap in time. Design features Significant de-risking lies at the heart of any solution to mobilize private capital – and there is no way to do this without massively scaling up direct budgetary resources, in our view. In practice, mobilization could come through a number of mechanisms - and we see a number of key design features of measures that we believe will help unleash private finance at scale. De-risking Public budgetary resources can play a critical role in de-risking investment opportunities. Many of the undiversifiable risks such as country risk, could be reduced via this type of public finance – potentially unlocking substantial pools of private finance currently prevented from being invested in EMs generally. But some changes are needed to the current system in order to achieve this – for example increasing grant-equivalent funding for first loss arrangements – in which the development or public finance institution agrees to take on part of the risks of an investment, including being the first to take on losses in the event of default. Facility-level financing Budgetary resources have greatest power to scale up this de-risking by providing finance at a facility level, rather than on a project-by-project basis. This could happen in several ways, for instance by using public funding as seed capital to set up a green investment bank in an EM economy, or to fund a mechanism such as an auctioned carbon price floor which can issue an investment instrument that is bankable and which supports decarbonization without investors taking on project completion risk. The bottom line A system that meets these key requirements can help ensure that the catalytic promise of significantly higher public budgetary resources can be realized, to ultimately deliver funding on the scale and at the pace needed to fund the green transition. The examples discussed above provide some illustrations of how this could happen. In practice, a combination of measures will be needed. We have focused on measures that can be scaled up to deliver quickly, but maximizing impact per dollar spent will require significant changes to existing multilateral and bilateral delivery channels. It may even entail a complete overhaul of current institutions or the creation of new ones. That’s for governments to determine, but in any event, action needs to be taken without delay. '},\n",

We stand by the broad themes we outlined in our outlook and hold conviction in our asset views. The overall direction of our strategic tilts has remained stable amid a noisy macro backdrop. We still tilt towards equities over credit and government bonds, even after the strong rebound we have seen since the equity market’s lows of March 2020. Overall strategic direction The overall direction of our strategic tilts has remained stable amid a noisy macro backdrop. Market sentiment has swung between extremes since our last update in May as fears of runaway inflation gave way to concerns over deflationary spirals in the matter of a few months. These swings reflect - in our view - the unusually wide range of significantly divergent yet plausible economic outcomes that potentially lie beyond the economic restart. Having an anchor is important in such an environment. We maintain high conviction in our new nominal investment theme that implies low real yields - a positive for risk assets – and see market overreactions may create opportunities to readjust portfolios. The new nominal, alongside our two other investment themes – China stands out and the journey to net zero – continue to guide our views. Our strategic tilts are summarized in the chart below. Our broad asset preference We maintain a higher allocation to equities than we would through typical periods of rising inflation as we believe the policy revolution has diminished the risk of a sharp rise in discount rates hitting valuations across asset classes. We continue to prefer equities over credit and government bonds. We already preferred DM equities over EM. This preference has been further bolstered by two factors: first, incorporating climate change in our return expectations brightens the relative appeal of DM indices whose sector composition is better aligned to the green transition and second, a more granular, sectoral approach to approach to equity allocations that we have now adopted allows us to lean more heavily into sectors such as tech and healthcare that we favor. In fixed income, We prefer inflation-linked bonds to DM nominal government bonds as portfolio ballast. The lower-for-longer environment boosts the appeal of private markets for eligible investors, in our view. We believe the low level of long-term bond yields is inconsistent with both restart dynamics and our macro outlook. We stick to our underweight in nominal DM government bonds and believe the direction of travel for nominal yields is higher. We stay overweight equities on a strategic horizon partly on the view that valuations do not look stretched in terms of the equity risk premium – our preferred gauge that considers the low interest rate implications of the new nominal. We also see earnings growth driving returns, though the pace of earnings growth will likely moderate as the growth spurt of the activity restart settles into an economic expansion. China stands out The strategic case for Chinese equities has come under scrutiny amid signs of a regulatory clampdown on certain private industries. The recent volatility underscores, in our view, the risks around policy implementation. This is a key reason why we maintain a high level of uncertainty around our mean return estimates on Chinese equities. At the same time, the income and portfolio ballast properties of Chinese government bonds remain attractive at a time when DM government bonds ballast properties have been diminished. The potential role Chinese assets can play in strategic portfolios highlights a key tenet of our broader investment views: portfolio resilience will likely be driven by deliberate diversification across countries, sectors and regions rather than broad asset class correlations. Journey to net zero Finally, the path to net-zero carbon emissions now has a starting point and potential destination – but there is no clear roadmap yet for getting there. Some of the coming changes may be abrupt – and add to supply and demand disruptions among commodities. We see opportunities along the way, particularly in private markets as we see private capital playing a key role in financing the climate transition. We see twists and turns in the journey to a more sustainable world. Our base case is for an improved outlook for growth and risk assets versus a do-nothing scenario yet acknowledge that uncertainty around this is very high. Monitoring the transition is key as we see it affecting the risk premia of all assets, in our view. Reflecting the granular approach we discuss are likely to vary significantly between different types of investors. Governance costs, constraints and other complexities could be limiting factors to how granular portfolios can go. Policy revolution The policy revolution in developed economies– marked by historic monetary and fiscal policy stimulus – has meant a surge in debt to record levels. Rising inflation coupled with continued fiscal spending from governments in the Western world means that we expect a revival in term premia – the extra compensation investors demand for holding long-term government bonds. The upshot: we see a steeper yield curve than markets expect as shown on the left chart below. Markets have also grappled with the Federal Reserve’s new framework. In June, investors extrapolated strong economic data amid the restart and assumed a policy reaction more akin to that of previous cycles to price in a much faster pace of Fed interest rate hikes than the Fed’s own – and our – projections. By the end of July, such expectations were tempered significantly and had moved down closer to the Fed’s view, as shown on the chart above on the right. One important implication of the new nominal for our CMAs is that our expectation of the path of short-term interest rates remains lower than what markets are currently pricing in. We expect a similar dynamic to play out in the euro area where the European Central Bank (ECB) has adopted a symmetrical 2% inflation target. We had already been assuming that sluggish inflation dynamics would spur a greater tolerance for inflation overshoots from the ECB, and a later lift-off in policy rates than the Fed. New nominal We discussed in our December 2020 paper A new playbook for higher inflation how longer-dated DM nominal government bonds remain challenged in their ability to provide portfolio diversification. Breaking down portfolio exposures across the yield curve in terms of short-dated bonds versus longer-dated bonds allows for a more deliberate expression of our macro framework than simply taking a view on the entire asset class. Our new nominal theme sets our expectations of the yield curve apart from what markets are currently pricing in two ways. First, we expect policy rates to remain lower for longer and second, we expect a steeper yield curve in the future than what market prices currently imply. Our estimates of nominal short-term yields stay below what the market is pricing meaning we see more return potential for shorter-dated assets than what markets expect as we see less room for yields to fall. Deliberate yield curve views Another aspect of new nominal is that we see medium-term – a five-to-ten-year horizon – inflation expectations as too low. The overhaul of central bank reaction functions along with supply-demand frictions as a result of re-globalisation and the green transition, will push inflation moderately higher in our view. Switching to both shorter (1-10 year) and longer (10+ year) indices from all-maturity government bond indices, we can express our new nominal theme in portfolios. We prefer a higher allocation to longer-dated inflation linked bonds compared to a market-cap weighted allocation in an all-maturity index given our expectation of higher medium-term inflation – something we believe markets may be underappreciating. Structural changes We discussed in detail in our May 2021 paper The role of Chinese assets how the acceleration of structural trends in the aftermath of the Covid shock helped further crystalize our strategic preference for Chinese assets. China’s regulatory clampdown on industries such as tutoring and tech has since unnerved global investors in recent months. Recent developments are an example of why the risk premium for investing China is higher than most DMs. Yet we do not believe this is the time to step away from China. The broader strategic case we have laid out for Chinese assets – that they should play a larger role in strategic allocations that they currently do – remains intact, in our view. Longer term, China remains a distinct pole of global growth, and we see it as an investment destination separate from both EM and DM. Our preferred strategic allocation to Chinese assets – both equities and bonds – remains higher than that suggested by their weight in broad global benchmark indexes. We recognize implementation of our asset views will differ across investor types and geographies, depending on objectives, constraints and regulation. Regulations in review One concern has been whether recent regulatory actions are evidence of underlying “anti-market” intentions that contradict rhetoric from policymakers aimed at enticing foreign capital. We do not believe this is the case. Why? For one, actions elsewhere – such as in credit markets where authorities are encouraging a greater tolerance of credit defaults – pave the path toward a clearer market pricing of risk. Second, authorities’ reaction to market volatility was telling. The Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, made up of the country’s most senior leaders, removed certain previously used hawkish regulatory language from their July meeting statement – a sign, in our view, of cognizance of the market impact and desire to calm sentiment. Lastly, we believe policymakers want to encourage more friendly foreign and private capital conditions as they see it key to meeting growth targets and developing onshore funding markets. The case for Chinese government bonds, in particular, is undimmed and the asset class remains a key strategic overweight in a low-yield world, in our view. The charts below highlight their appeal. They show that the income potential in Chinese government bonds relative to duration risk is considerably higher than DM peers – a key driver of our higher expected returns. Differences in yields across sovereign bond markets can be due to factors such as perceived sovereign risk, expectations for domestic economic conditions and monetary policy and market supply and demand. Strategic positioning The post-pandemic policy revolution in developed economies that has led to a surge in debt to record levels stands in contrast to what we are seeing in Asia’s largest economy. China is pursuing a more orthodox policy with both real and nominal interest rates positive and somewhat high when compared to global peers. We see China as an appealing investment destination for global investors searching for yield in bond markets because of this distinct policy approach. Why is China doing this? In our view, China believes that reducing risks in its financial system by limiting borrowing binges and moving to a somewhat more efficient allocation of capital is fundamental for it to achieve its ambitions in the coming years and decades. Restart dynamics The economic restart has driven high sector dispersion, due to the near-term economic environment and structural trends accelerated by the pandemic, in our view. The vaccine-led activity restart unfolding globally is very different from a typical business cycle recovery. There is no investment playbook to follow as this kind of forced shutdown on a global scale, a massive fiscal and monetary policy stimulus and the ongoing restart has little historical precedent. Rising earnings growth expectations have helped offset the impact of higher equity prices on our overall expected equity returns. In our latest CMA update, our expected equity returns in the latest update have fallen only slightly for the U.S., Europe, UK and EM ex-China – a reflection of restart dynamics. We see the sharp spurt in activity underway as the global economy emerges from lockdowns settle into an expansion around trend growth further down the line. The chart on the left below illustrates this pattern – earnings growth expectations beyond the immediate forward 12-month period is expected to moderate across regions, according to the latest Refinitiv data. Regional equity allocations have helped capture some of the divergences. A sectoral approach Yet one important trend under the surface is that sectoral divergences are even more stark than regional ones. We are introducing sector-level CMAs for the U.S. and Europe that we believe can help better exploit unfolding sectoral shifts in the post-Covid world. We see both medium- and long-term reasons for this. On the former, the restart has been marked by significant divergences in sector performance. The chart on the right shows how the latest forward earnings estimates for sectors within the MSCI USA and MSCI EMU stack up against each sectors’ pre-Covid estimate in December 2019. It shows how sectors in the U.S. – except energy – have mostly surpassed their pre-Covid estimates while peers in the euro area are just reaching those levels now, showing the broadening restart and how Europe is now picking up the baton from the U.S. There is significant divergence between sectors within the same region. Part of this can be attributed to a rebound in cyclical sectors geared to growth yet there is more to it. Some sector dynamics can be explained by the unique nature of the pandemic shock. Service-based, high-contact sectors suffered through the lockdowns and are still lagging goods-based sectors. The restart is now fuelling high demand in some areas due to pent-up demand and a savings surplus but also causing supply shortages. Crucially, we see this as different to a typical cyclical rotation as growth expectations have been revised up, yet interest rates have stayed low, supporting valuations of 'long duration' sectors such as tech. Journey to net zero The pandemic has turbocharged the shift toward sustainability. We believe high carbon emitting sectors such as energy and utilities are highly exposed to transition risks that will push their cost of capital up and profitability down. The energy sector’s recent strong performance reflects the near-term rebound in activity, in our view, as strong demand and supply shortages push up crude prices. We believe this may be short-lived as the transition to net zero leads to peak demand. Our return estimates for energy drop off sharply over the medium term. On the other hand, we like health care and IT on a strategic horizon. Firstly, we see tech and healthcare as aligned with the green transition. Secondly, both benefit from the low short rate environment we expect as part of the new nominal. We expect strong earnings growth, not just in the near-term but to persist beyond the restart. Finally, we do not see healthcare and tech as expensive versus our estimate of their long-run fair value based on the equity risk premium. Download report \"},\n",

       "  'content': ' Our strategic asset positioning still tilts towards equities over credit and government bonds, even after the strong rebound we have seen since the equity market’s lows of March 2020. We like developed markets (DM) and China within equities, helped in part by the impact of incorporating climate change in our return expectations. We prefer inflation-linked bonds to developed market (DM) nominal government bonds as portfolio ballast. The lower-for-longer environment also boosts the appeal of private markets for eligible investors. A key reason for staying the course on our strategic asset views is that we see our new nominal investment theme – that calls for a more muted response interest rates to higher inflation than in the past – playing out. The new nominal has been key to our pro-risk tactical investment views. Yet taken alongside the powerful, joint monetary-fiscal policy revolution that has dominated the Covid-19 response, it has significant implications for our strategic views as well. We see central banks, notably the Federal Reserve, leaning against sharp long-term yield rises. The upshot: we see a lower path of short-term interest rates compared with our previous expectation and current market pricing. This affects all our long-term return expectations. A disconnectExpectations for U.S. policy interest rates, 2021-2026 Forward looking estimates may not come to pass.

Notes: The chart shows expectations for the federal funds rate, the Fed’s policy target. Market pricing is based on futures on the U.S. dollar Secured Overnight Financing Rate. We use the median forecast in the March 2021 Survey of Market Participants by the New York Fed. The BII assumption is part of our economic projections in our capital market assumptions. The Fed median dot plot comes from the January 2021 Summary of Economic Projections. We update our capital market assumptions – the building blocks of our portfolio construction framework – to the end of the first quarter of 2021 to incorporate the implications of the new nominal more fully and reflect the changes in market prices and fundamentals. We see the equity risk premium – our preferred gauge of equity valuations that accounts for changes in interest rates – as in-line with historical averages, suggesting the asset class is not overvalued. By contrast, credit spreads are close to their tightest levels relative to history, underscoring our preference for equities over credit. We don’t agree with the narrative that higher long-term yields signal bad news for equities. We believe rising yields should not matter for equity valuations if they are due to the return of term premia – the compensation investors demand for holding riskier longer-term bonds – rather than expectations of a higher policy rate path. We believe higher term premia in a backdrop of a strong economic restart do not challenge equity valuations. Markets appear skeptical about the Fed’s ability to hold its ground and keep interest rates pinned near zero. Accelerating growth and higher inflation have caused a large gap to open up between current market pricing and consensus expectations for the path of interest rates. Such a gap suggests the federal funds rate, the Fed’s policy rate, would start rising much sooner than Fed officials’ own projections. Markets have pulled forward their rate hike expectations to late 2022 – a time frame we believe is inconsistent with the high bar the Fed has set. We believe the Fed is likely to start raising rates later than markets expect and more gradually than markets expect. The chart below contrasts our expectations with previous rate hiking cycles. More gradual rate hikesPast and expected U.S. rate hike cycles Forward looking estimates may not come to pass. Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, Federal Reserve and Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with data from Refinitiv Datastream, May 2021. Notes: The chart shows the path of Fed rate hike cycles since the 1990s (dotted lines) measured in quarters since the first hike and normalized to 0% at the point the Fed started raising rates for comparison purposes. The actual Fed policy rate at the start of each cycle were as follows:2.96% in 1993, 4.68% in 1998, 1% in 2004, 0.12% in 2016. The orange line shows our assumed path over the next 3 years based on our views on Fed’s policy framework and macro assumptions. Why the disconnect between the market and our expectations? We see two reasons. First, investors may be over-extrapolating from near-term growth and inflation data amid the powerful economic restart. We view the Covid shock as more akin to a natural disaster followed by a rapid “restart” – instead of a traditional business cycle recession followed by a “recovery.” That implies the huge near-term growth spurt will be transitory. And second, we believe many are still wedded to the central bank’s old policy framework and may underestimate the central bank’s commitment to meeting its inflation goals. The new nominal has implications beyond policy rates and the path of short-term interest rates. We believe the rise in nominal government bond yields – the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jumped 80 basis points over the first quarter – is justified. Rising yields reflect both financial markets and the Federal Reserve waking up to the reality of the strong, vaccine-driven activity restart – more powerful than a typical recovery – and large-scale fiscal spending becoming more concrete. Yet so far the rise in long-term U.S. Treasury yields – while quick – is more muted than typically seen in response to rising inflation and growth expectations in the past. Such market behaviour is typical of the new nominal dynamic that we expect to prevail in coming years. Lower for longerU.S. spot yield curve vs market and BlackRock estimates Forward-looking estimates may not come to pass. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream, May 2021. Notes: The chart shows the spot U.S. yield curve (green line) as of March 31, 2021 and estimates of what the curve might look like five years from now. The market-implied projection (yellow line) is derived from the spot rate using the forward rate formula. The dotted orange line shows our assumption of the shape of the yield curve in five years time. The interaction of monetary and fiscal policy is critical. We believe there is greater willingness from the central banks to quell rising government bond yields. Why? We see a strong incentive for policymakers to keep interest costs low to ensure the viability of surging debt burdens that were necessary to cushion the impact of the Covid shock. Even as long-term yields have risen this year, we see them topping out in five years’ time at lower levels than previously assumed. Their proximity to the effective lower bound, or the natural limits to how far long-term yields can drop, curtails the ability of DM nominal government bonds to act as portfolio ballast. Also, the blurring of monetary and fiscal policy – without proper guardrails – raises the risk of diminished central bank independence and uncontrolled fiscal spending. The relatively relaxed attitude to rising debt stems in large part due to low prevailing interest rates. In the US, debt is poised to reach a record level of 135% of GDP based on IMF forecasts, twice as high as in the 1990s, but financing costs are only half what they were then as a share of GDP. Eyes on the debt burdenU.S. interest cost estimates, 1990-2025 Forward-looking estimates may not come to pass. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream, May 2021. Notes: The chart shows : Interest payments are calculated as the difference between U.S. general government net borrowing and U.S. general government primary deficit and expressed as a share of nominal GDP. The first scenario in red shows hypothetical interest costs assuming that the effective interest rate on the existing debt stock rises quickly to 2.5% and holds there over the next four years. The second scenario shows the hypothetical impact of a more gradual rise to 2.5% by 2025. Hypothetical data results are based on assumptions applied retroactively with the benefit of hindsight, were not made under actual market conditions and, therefore, cannot completely account for the impact of economic risk. Actual results may differ. The spike higher in bond yields this year has spurred comparisons with the 2013 “taper tantrum” when a suggestion that the Fed would slow its asset purchases stoked fears of a stalling economic recovery, leading to a sharp selloff in equities. The chart below shows how the drivers of this year’s yield rise are very different. In 2013, it was a sharp repricing of the Fed’s projected rate path via higher real rates. Now it is a higher term premium – or the premium investors typically demand to hold riskier long-term government bonds – driven partly by greater uncertainty around inflation. This dynamic of low short rates alongside a powerful restart underpins our preference for equities over debt. Not stretchedBlackRock estimate equity risk premium vs. history Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream, April 2021. Notes: The chart shows the equity risk premium and historical ranges since 1995 for major equity regions based on respective MSCI indices. We calculate the equity risk premium based on our expectations for nominal interest rates and the implied cost of capital for each equity markets. Our belief that the move in bond yields is driven by rising term premia rather than expectations of higher policy rates is one reason why we don’t see the current rise in yields as detrimental to equities. Changes in term premia reflect duration risk and do not have direct implications for equity prices, in our view. Structural shifts such as persistently lower interest rates make it difficult to judge the signals from traditional metrics such as price-to-earnings ratios. Such metrics may suggest equities are overvalued yet fail to take into account the prevailing interest rate environment. We use the equity premium (ERP) – or the expected return of equities over the risk-free rate – as our preferred gauge. This approach helps us assess valuations across different interest rate environments and also accounts for the growth outlook. The chart above shows our estimates of the ERP for major equity markets relative to their history since 1995. All, expect Japan, are still above the historical median, underscoring our view that equities do not appear overvalued. See our global outlook for more. We believe a term premium tantrum in the current environment would imply a further shift away from allocations to DM government bonds– and could reinforce the strong performance of cyclical equity sectors rather than destabilizing broader risk assets.

       "  'content': \" A stronger narrative China has emerged from the pandemic with renewed confidence – just as it did after the global financial crisis (GFC). Growth has bounced back to trend and foreign direct investment inflows are surging, according to the data from China's National Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Commerce. A stable economic backdrop has made authorities more comfortable emphasizing structural reforms over short-term growth targets, in our view. This points to greater emphasis on reducing risks in the financial sector, pursuing self- sufficiency in energy and reducing dependency on imported technological know-how. The narrative around China has shifted away markedly, in our view, from concerns about the health of its financial system and credit- fueled growth. Its economic and market outperformance through yet another global shock has brought sharply into focus the important role Chinese assets can play in bringing resilience to strategic portfolios. It has deepened our overweight stance on Chinese assets. Such a view was in place due to their diversification potential and relatively better expected returns for Chinese assets over peers. As the chart shows, China and Asia ex-Japan are projected to continue increasing their global GDP share while the GDP share of North America, Europe and Japan weakens further. The acceleration of structural trends in the aftermath of the Covid shock has helped further crystalize our views on Chinese assets. The joint monetary-fiscal revolution in developed economies has seen interest rates plummet, lengthening the lower-for-longer outlook. Chinese bonds as portfolio ballast The income and portfolio ballast properties of China government bonds look relatively attractive at a time when developed market government bonds ballast properties have been diminished. Global debt levels have risen sharply as Western governments have put in place a fiscal impulse many multiples of what was seen during the GFC even as the overall estimated economic loss from the Covid shock is expected to be a fraction. China’s overall debt levels should be viewed in this context, in our view. The economy has rebounded without adding huge new debt – an important evolution that speaks to the focus on the quality of growth over the quantity, What we considered: China’s rise China’s presence on the global stage is becoming ever more prominent. Yet its representation in benchmark indexes is far below its economic and technological importance, as shown in the first chart. Trade volumes and direct investment inflows - both at record highs – show little sign of U.S.- China trade tensions impeding the country’s rise. This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance. Indexes are unmanaged and do not account for fees. It is not possible to invest directly in an index Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute and IMF, with data from Datastream Refinitiv, June 2020. Notes: The left chart show shows China’s representation across major macro and market metrics. We use the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index and MSCI ACWI equity index as proxies for global bonds and equities respectively. The right chart shows each region’s combined share of global GDP on a purchasing power parity basis. A nuanced picture The path forward for U.S.-China relations may be more predictable under U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration compared with recent years. The U.S. and China have committed to working together to tackle climate change, suggesting some re-engagement on key global issues. Yet we believe the strategic rivalry between the two powers – across multiple dimensions – is likely to persist. Economically, China has an ambition to double GDP by 2035 – surpassing the U.S. and firmly shifting the center of gravity for global growth to Asia in coming years. See the chart above on the right. The wide-ranging plans touch many flash points in the U.S.-China relationship, with the Covid pandemic amplifying each country’s focus on economic. Secure supply chains and self-sufficiency in critical technologies and industries are a strategic priority and could drive a rewiring of global trade. Intensifying competition between the U.S. and China on key technologies such 5G and semiconductors is one example. “Dual circulation” strategy A key component of China’s strategy is “dual circulation.” First floated by China's leadership in May 2020, dual circulation is the concept of both increasing the resilience of the economy by a greater emphasis on supply and demand within the domestic economy while also increasing the country's economic links with the rest of the world. Recent trade deals indicate changing future trade patterns rather than declining trade - between China and its regional partners through RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) and further afield with the European Union. RCEP – covering 30% of global GDP - brings China closer to South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia. We could increasingly see countries aligning with the two poles of growth – U.S. and China led – and even being forced to choose between the two. China’s linkages with global markets are poised to deepen – via greater index inclusion and openness to foreign investors – at the same time economic linkages are being remapped. For decades, the world was moving in a more globalized direction. Broadly, this meant that geographic exposures, such as country and region selection, were becoming less important. We believe that a considered approach to geographical diversification becomes increasingly important in a world where the almost one-way direction of travel for globalization has been interrupted. The splits across countries and regions - particularly the U.S. and China - and sectors such as technology are growing in prominence. This is true both from a return perspective - taking exposure to both engines of growth, as well as from a risk and diversification perspective - holding a greater balance of assets that are less correlated to each other. The potential role Chinese assets can play in strategic portfolios highlights a key tenet of our broader investment views: portfolio resilience may well be driven by deliberate diversification across countries, sectors and regions rather than broad asset class correlations. Growing return dispersion between regions due to a bifurcated world with the U.S. and China at opposite poles – see the Engines of growth chart – creates more return diversification potential. A “quality” revolution What does “quality” entail? In the context of China’s growth outlook, we believe it covers at least three areas highlighted by President Xi Jinping in January 2017 at the World Economic Forum: the environment, economic wellbeing and stability of the financial system. In other words, China wants to become a more productive economy with each unit of incremental GDP generating proportionately less pollution, inequality and financial risk (debt). This is the road to quality growth. We believe China will prioritize reforms that emphasize these goals as policymakers view them as mission-critical in achieving a more prosperous and powerful country. Debt and private markets Both the West and China are undergoing a policy revolution – one of our key themes since the Covid-19 shock struck. But crucially, these revolutions are very different. Western economies are blending large fiscal and monetary stimulus, with the hope that the scale of such policy support can help achieve societal aims beyond a narrow inflation goal. In China, we believe the revolution is a sincere effort to move away from an overriding focus on the quantity of growth towards a greater focus on the quality of growth. Western governments have put in place a fiscal impulse many multiples of what was seen during the GFC even as the overall estimated economic loss from the Covid shock is expected to be a fraction. We believe China’s overall debt levels should be viewed in this context. China’s quality revolution and the structural changes we see unfolding in the economy has important implications for the fast-growing market for private assets. The dual circulation strategy, a push to become carbon neutral by 2060 and urbanization are long-term transformations that may not be appropriately captured by assets listed and traded on public markets today, in our view. Investors wanting to participate in such transformations may want to consider doing so via private markets but should be cognizant of the risks involved. Tapping into private markets Private markets may be better placed to offer targeted exposure to emerging domestic trends in China. A Bain & Company Asia-Pacific private equity survey found investors saw the biggest growth in funding businesses driven by digitization. We see real estate and private equity and credit growing rapidly in China. See charts below for details.

The chart on the right shows the sectors in which institutional private market investors see the biggest growth in China according to a Bain & Co 2021 survey. Sustainability in focus Sustainability will be a powerful driver of global returns in the medium term, in our view, and ever more central to all investment decisions. There are many aspects to sustainability – and the weight placed on each differs across investors. As a result, the overall assessment of China is investor specific. We consider both the current status as well as the direction of travel when it comes to assessing China’s sustainability credentials. We see improvement on several fronts – notably its environmental commitments – but recognize there is further to go, and commitments need to be realized. Our asset return assumptions (CMAs) incorporate the impact of climate change on long-term asset returns. Popular wisdom has it that investing in China and being climate-friendly are at odds. We disagree. China’s commitment to a net- zero economy by 2060 was an important step – not just for its own economy, but for global progress toward climate goals. China’s economy stands to benefit the most among major nations from a “green” transition to a more sustainable world, in our analysis, than a scenario of no climate action. In our CMAs we focus on the E in ESG. Why? There is wide recognition of the importance of climate change for economic and social outcomes. There is consensus on the measurement of an entity’s contribution to climate change via carbon emissions. These factors suggest climate change will be a driver of returns at the broad market level. See our paper Climate change: Turning investment risk into opportunity of February 2021 for more. Our overweight to Chinese assets versus benchmark indexes does not change after taking into account the impact on climate change on expected returns. The composition of Chinese equity indexes is better aligned with the transition to a low-carbon economy, in our view. For instance, China’s industrial sector has around a 39% share of China GDP. Yet industrials only make up 5% of the MSCI China index, which has a higher concentration in the ‘greener’ sectors, such as consumer discretionary (34%) and consumer services (20%). Incorporating sustainability in the investment process requires distinguishing between current conditions and potential opportunities. The focus of China’s leaders on achieving a carbon-neutral economy will likely filter through to corporate priorities and objectives. The BlackRock Investment Stewardship team engages with Chinese companies – just as in other jurisdictions – to strengthen sustainability disclosures: see its framework for dealing with broader ESG issues in its global engagement priorities for 2021. We recognize that disclosures have a long way to go. Yet we believe this should not detract from the fundamental case for Chinese assets in strategic portfolios. Some concerns on sustainability will likely persist. We expect social and governance issues to take on greater prominence in the wake of Covid-19. We see sustainability rising beyond the mere labels of E, S and G. That brings along complications that often relate to lack of proper data. There is some ways to go on achieving adequate disclosures – but we see this as a potential area of evolution and progress in coming years that should be closely watched. Risk and return The Chinese economy and markets have evolved rapidly and so views on risk and return cannot be anchored entirely on the past. Our case for “why China” is not based on better economic growth expectations. In fact, our estimates of Chinese growth are modest relative to history – we estimate annual real GDP growth on average will be less than 4% in a decade. Yet our expected returns look at much more than regional GDP. Market-based earnings estimates, the outlook for profit margins, valuations and the path of domestic rates have a greater bearing on our expected returns than growth. Our estimate of the equity risk premium – our preferred metric to gauge valuations - stands at 7.3% for the mainland stock market compared with 4.3% for the U.S., pointing to attractive risk-reward for the former.

Notes: The chart shows expected total nominal returns from a U.S. dollar perspective.Asset return expectations are gross of fees. There are two sets of bands around our mean return expectations.

The regional equity markets are represented by the MSCI regional indexes. China A- shares are represented by the MSCI China A-share onshore index and China equities by MSCI China.

They are not intended to be indicative of any fund or strategy’s performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. We expect Chinese onshore listed equity returns to outpace broad EM and DM aggregate indexes, driven mainly by higher earnings growth and higher payout ratios than the past due to demands from international investors and pressure from the Chinese securities regulator. We expect Chinese yields to rise, yet on a risk-adjusted basis see returns more attractive than comparable developed and emerging market government bonds. Our five-year annualized expected returns for Chinese government bonds are higher than for U.S. Treasuries. See the chart above. For expected returns on Chinese bonds to equal the expected return on U.S. Treasuries, we would need to see China government bond yields to rise sharply from current levels – an unlikely event, in our view. Above benchmark allocation We believe a neutral starting point allocation to China for most investors is significantly greater than that implied by benchmark indexes today. We are overweight Chinese assets, particularly government bonds, relative to their weight in broad global benchmark indexes. See our regional tilts in the geographical breakdown chart.

Actual performance may vary significantly from our hypothetical multi-asset portfolio due to transaction costs, liquidity or other market factors. Indexes are unmanaged, do not account for management fees and one cannot invest directly in an index. Strategic opportunity We believe investors, on average, are underinvested in Chinese assets – even below what we believe to be neutral levels suggested by current global benchmarks. An internal survey of portfolio trends in EMEA conducted by the BlackRock Portfolio and Analytics Solutions group over the course of 2020 showed the average explicit allocation to China was just 0.3% to equities and a mere 0.05% for fixed income. The implied exposure via broader emerging markets allocation was also relatively slim – under 3% for equities and under 0.5% for bonds. Chinese equities are about 5% of the MSCI ACWI equity index and bonds comprise about 7.5% in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index. Overall foreign ownership in onshore Chinese assets is low even after the recent surge in inflows as index inclusion has picked up. Offshore investors own 4.3% of the domestic A-share market and 2.9% of onshore bonds as of the end of 2020, according to data from the People’s Bank of China. We believe global investors should look to up allocation as access opens up.

Avoiding damages from climate change The popular notion that tackling climate change comes at a net cost to the global economy is wrong, we believe. Avoiding climate-related damages will help prevent economic deterioration and improve risk-asset returns, in our view. We see the “green” transition to a carbon-neutral world rewarding companies, sectors and countries that adjust and penalizing others. That is why our capital market assumptions (CMAs) – long-run estimates of risk and return – now reflect the impact of climate change. Estimates in this area are highly uncertain, yet our framework is designed to account for this. We will refine this framework as we monitor the evolution of the “green” transition. We focus on climate because we believe a broad consensus around its impact and measurement suggests that climate change is fast becoming a key driver of asset pricing. Our updated CMAs are driven by sectoral views, with exposure to climate risks and opportunities a key determinant. We see technology and healthcare benefiting the most from that perspective, and carbon-intensive sectors such as energy and utilities lagging. This in turn increases our strategic preference for developed market (DM) equities, at the expense of high yield and some emerging market (EM) debt. Why? The composition of DM equity indexes better aligns with the climate transition, with large weights of technology and healthcare companies, less vulnerability to transition risks and lower carbon intensity. Equities also can better capture potential opportunities of the green transition, as bonds are capped in their capital appreciation. Sectors that face structural challenges due to rising climate awareness, such as energy and utilities, are more prevalent in high yield and EM debt indexes. Download full PDF report The green transition The two scenarios to compare from this perspective: a transition to a low- carbon economy in which policies to fight climate change are enacted, and a no-climate-action scenario with no actions to limit damages. A commonly held notion is that tackling climate change has to come at an economic cost. We think that’s wrong. We assume the global economy transitions to a lower carbon path consistent with Paris Agreement goals. The positive effect of this transition rests on a gradual phasing in of carbon taxes, green infrastructure spending consistent with the IMF’s recommendation, and subsidies on renewable energy. If none of these actions are taken to mitigate climate change, we estimate a cumulative loss in global output of nearly 25% in the next two decades. The stylized Accounting for climate change chart illustrates the potential difference between the two paths. We focus on the \"E\" (environmental) of ESG in our updated CMAs. Why? First, there is wide recognition of the importance of climate change on economic and social outcomes. Second, there is consensus on the measurement of an entity’s contribution to climate change: carbon emissions. Carbon emissions have become a widely enough adopted indicator of sustainability for investors to be a driver of repricing at the broad market level. We see insights into S (social) and G (governance) as key sources of potential returns through security selection, rather than as systematic drivers of returns. We will consider incorporating them in our framework once consensus around their impact and availability of consistent data improve in coming years. Getting into the macro We believe macro variables will be different in a world that is transitioning to a sustainable future. Such changes mean sustainability affects everything that goes into forming a view on long-term asset class returns. We see changes in so-called risk premia for all asset classes – the compensation investors require for holding them. Repricing effects The price investors are willing to pay for sustainable assets is changing. The BlackRock 2020 Global Sustainability Survey of September 2020 found 425 institutional investors planned to double their sustainable assets under management in the next five years to 37%. We see this as a tectonic shift toward sustainable assets. Changing investor preferences will spur a climate change-led repricing due to the falling cost of capital for sustainable assets. These assets will generate higher returns than traditional peers as a result, in our view. Investors are just starting to respond to the structural shift, suggesting it is not yet in the price. Once this repricing phase has passed, we believe this channel will eventually no longer be a boon for “greener” assets’ expected returns. Back to the fundamentals Climate change and policies to mitigate it will affect profitability across sectors, we believe. This will have knock-on effects on other variables such as credit default and downgrade assumptions. No one knows yet what a low-carbon world will look like. Climate projections are highly uncertain. This is due to the complexity of modeling the dynamics and myriad dependencies between climate and carbon emissions, economic variables and mitigation policies. Our framework allows us to systematically monitor key metrics and the evolution of the green transition, and we plan to adapt it accordingly. Our approach explicitly accounts for uncertainty - highly relevant for climate change that will have varying but highly uncertain impacts over time. We believe this approach lends itself well to the structural transformation taking place. '},\n",

       "  'content': \" Most ignore the effects of climate change in their financial projections. We believe this is not right. Climate change is real and cannot be ignored by investors. Climate risk is investment risk, and we see it is as a historic investment opportunity. Our capital market assumptions (CMAs) – a core input to building portfolios – for the first time, explicitly reflect the impact of climate change on the investment landscape. This is one of a set of actions we are taking to prepare investors for the global transition to a net zero emissions economy by 2050 or sooner. Pioneering research The commonly held notion that tackling climate change has to come at a net cost to the global economy is wrong, in our view. If no action is taken to combat climate change, the considerable physical damages would imply a lower path of economic growth. Our CMAs reflect our view that the green transition to a low-carbon economy, consistent with the Paris Agreement goals, will deliver an improved outlook for growth and risk assets relative to doing nothing. The chart below shows our estimates of the impact on China – an increasingly important pillar of the global economy and one where the impact of climate change is likely to be significant. Seeing green Estimated GDP paths scenario for China, 2020-40 Forward looking estimates may not come to pass. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, Banque de France, International Energy Agency, OECD, January 2021. Notes: The chart shows our estimated path for China’s GDP over the next 20 years under the two mentioned scenarios. GDP levels are rebased to 100 as of 2020. Underpinning the climate-aware CMAs is our view of an orderly transition that successfully limits climate-related damage. The tectonic shift toward sustainability has gathered momentum over the past year following a series of major climate change commitments by corporations, governments and investors alike, bolstering our conviction in an orderly transition to a low-carbon world. Investors are just starting to respond to the structural shift – suggesting it is not yet fully in the price of assets. The BlackRock 2020 Global Sustainability Survey found that respondents plan to double their sustainable assets under management (AUM) in the next five years – rising from 18% of AUM on average today to 37% on average by 2025. We see climate change and the green transition as persistent drivers of asset returns, and consequently fundamental to making strategic investment decisions. Climate change and policies to combat it flow through our CMAs via three main channels: the macroeconomic impact, the repricing of assets to reflect climate risks and exposures and the impact on corporate fundamentals. A historic investment opportunity Climate change and efforts to curb it will have major economic outcomes, not just far into the future but in the next few decades (Dietz et al., 2020). We have updated the long-term macroeconomic framework that underpins our CMAs. Such an outlook rejects the commonly held notion that tackling climate change has to come at a net cost to society. Globally, we estimate a cumulative loss in economic output of nearly 25% over the next two decades due to the level of GDP being 2.3% lower in 20 years’ time if no climate change mitigation measures were taken. The chart below shows the potential cumulative impact of three factors – avoidance of climate damage, transition costs, and green infrastructure spending – on GDP by 2040. China’s green opportunity Estimated cumulative impact as a percentage of GDP scenario for China, 2020-40 Forward looking estimates may not come to pass. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, Banque de France, International Energy Agency, OECD, January 2021. Notes: The chart shows the cumulative impact on long-term GDP under a green transition relative to a no-climate-action scenario. The bars show the overall estimated impact of three factors – avoidance of climate damages (positive), green infrastructure spending (positive) and costs associated with the transition (negative). The black line shows the estimated net impact. Our estimates of the impact under a climate-aware scenario are based on expected changes in energy consumption including composition, relative carbon and renewables pricing and on potential losses due to global warming. Energy consumption is estimated as a function of GDP and the relative price of energy per the Banque de France's working paper no. 759 titled the Long-term growth impact of climate change and policies. GDP losses from global warming are calibrated on analysis of Impact Assessment Models per W. Nordhaus and A..Moffat (2017). We assume green infrastructure spending programs of 1% of GDP gradually phased out over the next 10 years. Getting into the macro We first incorporate climate damages into our economic projections. The economic losses, associated with rising temperatures, build over time and are more pronounced in some regions than others (Burke et al., 2015). Call this the “no-climate-action” scenario – climate damages occur, but no action is taken to combat it. We then consider a second economic scenario, with policies and innovations that could mitigate climate damages – call this the “green transition” scenario. Specifically, in the green transition we consider the actions needed to ensure the Paris Agreement target of limiting temperature rises to below 2 degrees Celsius is achieved. The green transition is our base case for our updated CMAs and strategic asset class preferences. Economic loss due to climate damages can be largely avoided, in our view, by proactive climate policy action that keeps the global temperature change within the margins of the Paris Agreement through a combination of gradually rising carbon taxes and clean energy subsidies (Burke et al., 2018). We acknowledge the risks to the downside in our green transition scenario. Delays in implementing climate policies could result in a “disorderly transition”. Policy execution will be key: any shortfalls could undermine the policy predictability and credibility, making the energy transition more costly. The “E” in ESG There is wide recognition of the importance of climate change for economic and social outcomes and second, there is consensus on the measurement of an entity’s contribution to climate change - via carbon emissions. Carbon emissions are a widely enough adopted indicator of sustainability for investors to the extent that it can be a driver of repricing at the broad market level. We see insights into S (social) and G (governance) issues as potential sources of alpha impacting security selection, rather than as systematic drivers of returns and so exclude them from our CMAs. Macro variables such as GDP would be different in a world that is transitioning to a low carbon future, meaning traditional risk premia for all asset classes will change. The chart below shows our updated CMAs for selected asset class – the green dots show the mean expected returns in our base case of a green transition and the red dots indicate the expected returns in a no-climate-action scenario. For U.S. equities, our expected returns in a no-climate-action scenario would fall outside the band of uncertainty around our mean estimate, highlighting the potentially large impact from climate change.

There are two sets of bands around our mean return expectation. The darker bands show our estimates of uncertainty in our mean return estimates. The lighter bands are based on the 25th and 75th percentile of expected return outcomes – the interquartile range for more detail read Portfolio perspectives. Beyond the carbon cost In addition to the macro impact, we see the effects playing out through two more channels: Repricing: One consequence of shifting societal preferences is that the price investors are willing to pay for assets perceived to be sustainable is changing, driving differentiated returns. Capital flows toward sustainable assets are a symptom of this phenomenon. Our CMAs now directly reflect our estimates of such a premium. Fundamentals: This channel could be seen as an extension of the macro one. Some companies and sectors are better positioned than others for a transition to a low carbon economy. Corporate behavior will likely respond by adapting to policy and regulatory changes brought about to combat climate change. Profitability across sectors will be impacted. There will be sectoral winners and losers – underpinning why we believe a sectoral approach to sustainable investing is additive to a regional one. The chart below shows the estimated return impact across sectors from both the repricing and fundamental channels. We estimate a 7% annualized return differential over five years between the energy and technology sectors – a significant difference in a world of low expected returns across asset classes. Total return impact Estimated 5-year expected return differential for U.S. sectors in green transition vs, no action, February 2021 This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream and Bloomberg, February 2021. Notes: The chart shows the difference in five-year U.S. dollar expected returns for the highest sub-category of MSCI USA sectors under two economic scenarios - a green transition and a no-climate-action scenario. The difference in expected return is attributable to repricing – the return impact of changing cost of capital - and fundamentals – or the return impact of changing earnings per share growth. Uncertainty is a key element of our framework and is built into our CMAs. No one yet knows what a low-carbon world looks like. The transition may play out over several years, if not decades. We will monitor key trends such as capital flows, policy developments and technological advancements – and the way asset prices respond to them – and look to evolve our framework as new information becomes available. Our portfolio construction approach that explicitly accounts for uncertainty and provides a term structure of returns to capture the time varying impact of climate change lends itself well to the structural transformation we see playing out. Portfolio implications Tactical, or shorter-term, investment decisions will not be sufficient, in our view, to position for the fundamental reshaping of the global economy we see playing out. Positioning portfolios appropriately requires expressing views at the strategic asset level. Like any investment view, the ultimate implementation and sizing of climate change-led views in portfolios will vary depending on an investor’s risk appetite, objectives and eligible universe. Some investors may have to reallocate as much as 10-20% of existing assets. For others, it will be less. See our investor-specific asset allocation breakdowns for more. Our strategic asset preferences for a hypothetical unconstrained, U.S. dollar investor with a 10-year horizon are shown on the chart below and put our asset class views in a portfolio context. They reflect our views on all drivers of long-term asset returns, from the monetary and fiscal policy revolution to structural trends, such as the U.S.-China rivalry and the polarization of global growth. The impact of introducing climate change as an additional driver of returns on asset class views is shown on the right. Tilting toward sustainability Hypothetical U.S. dollar 10-year strategic allocation vs. our equilibrium view, February 2021 This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream and Bloomberg, February 2021. Notes: The chart shows our asset views on a 10-year view from an unconstrained US dollar perspective against a long-term equilibrium allocation described on our capital market assumptions website. The portfolio is illustrative and the allocation above does not represent any existing portfolio and, as such, is not an investible product. The construction of the hypothetical asset allocation is based on criteria applied with the benefit of hindsight and knowledge of factors that may have positively affected its performance and cannot account for risk factors that may affect the actual portfolio's performance. The actual performance may vary significantly from our modelled CMAs due to transaction costs, liquidity or other market factors. Indexes are unmanaged, do not account for management fees and one cannot invest directly in an index. See appendix for full list of index proxies. The most significant impact is a stronger preference for developed market equities at the expense of high yield and emerging market debt. The composition of developed market equity indices better aligns with the climate transition and equities have more ability to capture the upside opportunities from the climate transition. The higher carbon intensity of companies that typically make up high yield and emerging market debt benchmark indices detracts from their expected returns, diminishing their appeal within our overall preferred strategic allocation. Another impact of incorporating climate change in our CMAs - granular investing becomes more prominent in portfolio construction. We believe climate change will drive greater dispersion of returns at a sector level than at the asset class level. We see sectors as the relevant unit of investment analysis and if we allow sector granularity in our portfolio construction, buying assets at the sector level rather than at an index-based regional level, the impacts on strategic asset preferences can be material. We have a strategic preference for inflation–linked government bonds over nominal government bonds. We see the policy revolution driving higher inflation over the medium-term but don’t expect rising inflation expectations to be reflected through higher nominal yields as much as was historically the case. Yet we see a diminished ability of nominal bonds to act as ballast and expect high public debt levels to push yields higher over the strategic horizon. We are strategically underweight credit as we see valuations as expensive on a relative basis relative to equities. Our preference for a strategic overweight to Chinese assets overall is not diminished – and is, in fact, enhanced for Chinese government bonds given the relatively poorer outlook for comparable assets.

       "  'content': ' Read details of our midyear outlook: The Great Moderation is over The Great Moderation, from mid-1980s until 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, was a remarkable period of stability of both growth and inflation. We were in a demand-driven economy with steadily growing supply. Borrowing binges drove overheating, while collapsing spending drove recessions. Central banks could mitigate both by either raising or cutting rates. That period has ended, in our view. Bracing for volatility This new market environment has echoes of the early 1980s. We are bracing for volatility in this regime. Central banks are rushing to raise rates to contain inflation that’s rooted in production constraints. They are not acknowledging the stark trade-off: crush economic growth or live with inflation. The Fed, for one, is likely to choke off the restart of economic activity - and only change course when the damage emerges. We see this driving high macro and market volatility, with short economic cycles. Equities would suffer if rate hikes trigger a growth downturn. If policymakers tolerate more inflation, bond prices would fall. Either way, the macro backdrop is no longer conducive for a sustained bull market in both stocks and bonds, we believe. We see higher risk premia across the board and think portfolio allocations will need to become more granular and nimble. Living with inflation We think we will be living with inflation. For all the noise about containing inflation, we see policymakers ultimately living with some of it. We remain overweight equities and underweight government bonds in long-term portfolios. We expect investors to demand more compensation to hold long-term bonds in this new regime. We see a high risk of growth stalling and reduce equities to underweight. We now prefer to take risk in credit because we don’t see contained default risk. Positioning for net zero We see the bumpy transition to net-zero carbon emissions shaping the new regime – and believe investors should start positioning for net zero. We think investors can be bullish on both fossil fuels and sustainable assets, as we see a key role for commodities in the transition. Yet our work finds that changing societal preferences can give sustainable assets a return advantage for years to come. Ready to shift views We stay pro-equities on a strategic horizon but are underweight in the short run. Biases built up during the Great Moderation, like buying risk asset dips, won’t work as well as before, in our view. A new regime of greater macro volatility, shorter cycles and more volatile markets, means a dynamic approach to portfolio positioning. Our conviction is that portfolios will need to change more quickly. Ready to shift views Our conviction is that portfolios will need to change more quickly.

       "  'content': ' Inflation jitters We have been flagging higher inflation since the unprecedented policy response to the pandemic, and this prospect is now driving markets. Our core new nominal theme implies that rising inflation will have more benign market implications than in the past. Central banks are likely to lean against any sharp rises in nominal government bond yields. As a result, real interest rates could stay negative into the medium term. This makes for a positive backdrop for risk assets, and keeps us pro risk with tactical overweights in equities and credit. Yet markets have risen significantly, and we see potential for pullbacks driven by pandemic and vaccine rollout dynamics. Globalization rewired The pandemic has accelerated a rewiring of globalization – with a bipolar U.S.-China world order at its center. We see the new U.S. administration bringing greater predictability in trade policies. Climate is likely to become a central policy priority – and an area for potential U.S.-China cooperation. Yet economic, technological and strategic competition with China looks here to stay – and we believe investors need exposures to both poles of global growth. Rising debt A spike in government debt to record levels – a result of a policy revolution in cooperation between fiscal and monetary authorities – was a necessary response to the Covid shock. It may be politically tough for governments to unwind large-scale fiscal support, and the perceived safety premium for holding government bonds could eventually erode. But we are not concerned about these dynamics in the near term as central banks face pressures to maintain a stable, low-rate environment, keeping a lid on debt servicing costs. Unprecedented response The joint fiscal-monetary policy revolution has delivered historic support to help bridge economies to a post-pandemic world when vaccines become more widely available. We have seen an unprecedented rise in peacetime spending, with discretionary fiscal stimulus far exceeding what we saw after the global financial crisis (GFC). The increase in debt under the current shock also exceeds that of the GFC, even in the absence of large-scale bailouts this time. This has happened against a backdrop of much higher debt levels than a decade ago. As a result, debt-to-GDP ratios have soared to record levels globally. Key risks ahead Fiscal and financial dominance are key risks that could be mutually reinforcing. It could become politically difficult for governments to unwind large-scale fiscal support. And raising interest rates will become more politically fraught for central banks against a backdrop of high debt levels. Even a courageous central bank may end up having to backtrack if an attempt to normalize policy were to result in a “taper tantrum” event that significantly tightened financial conditions. A bipolar world order The pandemic has accelerated a rewiring of globalization – with a bipolar U.S.-China world order at its center. We see the Biden administration as bringing greater predictability and taking a different approach on trade and climate policy. Yet overall tensions with China appear set to stay elevated amid ongoing economic, technological and strategic competition – and we believe investors need exposures to both poles of global growth. Globalization rewired, one of the three key investment themes introduced in our 2021 Global Outlook, is about an acceleration of geopolitical transformations. At its center: a bi-polar U.S.-China world order and the remapping of global supply chains. This is not the same as deglobalization. Clear changes ahead We expect a clear change of tenor and tone in the Biden administration’s foreign policy approach, including a shift to working with allies on key issues: China, Russia, Iran, democracy and cyber security. The Biden administration will likely use alliances with groups of countries to engage China. The nomination of veteran Asia specialist Kurt Campbell to serve the new role of Indo-Pacific Coordinator is a signal of such an approach – as well as the administration’s expectation that intense competition is likely to dominate U.S.-China relations. This is taking place as China has emerged stronger from 2020 with its successful containment of the virus and a lead in the economic restart. It has also signed important trade deals including an investment agreement with the European Union, and a regional free trade agreement with Asia-Pacific nations including Japan and South Korea. Climate action Climate is likely to become a central policy priority under the Biden administration – and an area for potential cooperation in U.S.-China relations amid broader tensions around trade and human rights. Frictions may extend to the financial arena, as evidenced in the forced delisting of some Chinese companies in the U.S. market. We see this as a reason for carefully implementing China exposures, perhaps including consideration of greater direct allocations to China-listed securities over time. Yet how to implement China exposures will depend on investor constraints, including political and legal ones. Portfolio insights Strategically, we see assets exposed to Chinese growth as core holdings that are distinct from emerging market exposures. Tactically, we are overweight Asia ex-Japan equities as many Asian countries have been more effective at containing the virus and are further ahead in the economic restart. Risks to China-exposed assets include China’s high debt levels, currency volatility and heightened U.S.-China conflicts. But we believe investors are well compensated for these. BlackRock’s 2021 investment themes The new nominal We see stronger growth and lower real yields as the vaccine-led restart accelerates and central banks limit nominal yields gains even as inflation expectations climb. Inflation will likely have different implications to the past. Strategic implication: We are underweight government bonds and see equities supported by falling real rates. Tactical implication: Our low rate outlook keeps us pro-risk. We like U.S. equities and prefer high yield for income. The first half of 2021 is likely to be choppy. The pandemic challenges public health and the activity restart, while we see more policy support in the U.S. on top of the recent $900 billion fiscal package. We prefer a barbell approach to risk exposures, with selected cyclicals such as U.S. small-caps and emerging market equities on one end and quality assets including U.S. and Asia ex-Japan equities on the other. We also like tech and healthcare. These sectors can benefit from structural trends turbocharged by the pandemic, in our view, and their strong balance sheets and cash flows help provide some resilience against volatility. Yet we recognize U.S. tech could face challenges from greater regulation and corporate taxes. We remain pro-risk overall, favoring overweights in both equities and credit, but see a potentially bumpy path for asset prices broadly, especially as markets have moved a lot since we published our 2021 global outlook in early December. Globalization rewired Covid-19 has accelerated geopolitical transformations such as a bipolar U.S.-China world order and a remaking of global supply chains, placing greater weight on resilience – even at the expense of efficiency. Strategic implication: We favor deliberate country diversification and above-benchmark China exposures. Tactical implication: We like EM equities, especially Asia ex-Japan, and are underweight Europe and Japan. Turbocharged transformations The pandemic has added fuel to pre-existing structural trends such as an increased focus on sustainability, rising inequality within and across nations, and the dominance of e-commerce at the expense of traditional retail. Strategic implication: We prefer sustainable assets amid a growing societal preference for sustainability. Tactical implication: We take a barbell approach, favoring tech and healthcare as well as selected cyclical exposures. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Joe Biden has won the contest for the White House — an outcome that signifies a return to a near-term market environment dominated by low rates, a hunt for yield and growth stocks. Against a historic backdrop of a pandemic, a victory in the battleground state of Pennsylvania pushed President-elect Biden above the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Risks to the outcome appear remote, and we prefer to look through any market volatility that legal challenges by President Trump may bring. A Democratic sweep — with Democrats also seizing control of the U.S. Senate — looks unlikely, although a runoff election for two Georgia Senate seats in January keeps the race alive. A divided government would constrain the Biden administration’s ability to implement plans for large-scale fiscal stimulus and public investment, tax, healthcare and climate related legislation. We see an increased focus on sustainability under a divided government, but through regulatory actions, rather than via tax policy or spending on green infrastructure. It also would likely signify a return to more predictable trade and foreign policy — even as U.S.-China rivalry is set to stay elevated due to bipartisan support for a more competitive stance. Fiscal policy is critical for preventing permanent economic damage from the virus shock. Some fiscal relief looks possible in the near term during the lame-duck session of Congress, but we see the scope and size of fiscal stimulus and public investment as much more modest than what a united Democratic government might have delivered. We’re monitoring the fiscal response closely, as a premature retrenchment could set back an economic restart that has so far surprised to the upside. Long-term U.S. Treasury yields had ran up ahead of Election Day in anticipation of a Democratic sweep, bringing forward a rise in yields we expect to see in a higher inflation regime in the medium term. The prospect of a divided government removed the accelerant and brought yields down again. A slower upward move in yields bodes well for risk assets, in our view, especially for credit and growth companies that have dominated markets for much of the post-crisis period. Emerging market (EM) assets should perform on improved trade sentiment, we believe, especially in Asia ex-Japan. Many Asian countries have contained the virus and are ahead in the economic restart. We are reviewing our tactical asset views in light of the election result. Key inputs include the evolution of the virus shock and the timeline for a vaccine — and their potential to bring forward market expectations of inflation and change equity market leadership to cyclicals.

       "  'content': ' The impact of Covid-19 has transformed the investment landscape in a matter of few months. It is precisely the type of event that underscores the importance of a portfolio construction approach that incorporates uncertainty in estimating asset returns instead of an over-reliance on point estimates. The material changes in our strategic asset views – a typically slow moving process – reflect an environment where capturing opportunities brought about by substantial swings in valuations and asset prices have warranted sizeable reallocations in a short amount of time. Sizeable reallocations The Covid-19 shock turned on its head the economic trajectory that markets had priced in at the end of last year, precipitating an urgent need to revisit strategic asset allocations. We argued as early as March at the depths of the market selloff that the impact of the pandemic and the policy response were likely to be severe enough to warrant an overhaul of how to position portfolios to be resilient to the accelerating structural changes. Market prices, asset valuations and economic projections have seen big swings in the space of two quarters. This has – in turn – had a sizeable impact on our expected returns and asset views over the course of the year. The charts below highlights how our asset views – based on our CMAs – have evolved from the start of the year to now. They highlight how typically slow-moving strategic asset allocation decisions need to be taken more quickly than usual to ready portfolios to be resilient to the new investment landscape and respond to potential price dislocations. Evolving viewsOur fixed income, equity and credit strategic views since the start of the year, August 2020 This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute. August 2020. Data as of June 2020. Notes: The charts show our asset views on a 10-year view from an unconstrained U.S. dollar perspective have changed through the course of the year. Our February 2020 views represent our asset preferences based on our capital market assumptions as of Dec 31, 2019. The March 2020 views show asset preferences based on CMAs as of March 26, 2020 and the May 2020 views represent preferences based on CMAs as of April 13, 2020. Global government bonds and EM equity allocations include respective China assets. The “overweight”, “neutral” and “underweight” refer to relative asset class tilts against a long-term equilibrium allocation as shown on our capital market assumptions website. The hypothetical portfolio may differ from those in other jurisdictions, is intended for information purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Index proxies are in the appendix. In February, we favored a barbell approach in our SAAs comprising equities and government bonds and preferring both to credit. We had flagged the risk of government bonds losing their appeal as portfolio ballast as yields approach their perceived lower bounds. Yet we were overweight the asset classes due to our conviction that U.S. Treasuries remained diversifiers thanks to their higher yields. Our focus on constructing downside-aware portfolios by incorporating uncertain in return assumptions – a core tenet of our process – informed the barbell approach. By March the story had changed dramatically. A quick and fierce selloff in risk assets, reminiscent of the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC), was underway on fears of the economic cost of the coronavirus outbreaks and containment measures. Yet we held a view that this would not be a repeat of GFC as long as the policy response was sizeable and swift because the economy and financial system were on firmer footing. We wrote in April 2020 that the unprecedented policy response would make the cumulative impact of the pandemic likely a fraction of that seen after the GFC even if the initial contraction was larger. Q2 GDP data have helped confirm this. We argued that strategic investors could turn the crisis into an opportunity by adding exposure to risk assets at the expense of government bonds where we reversed our overweight. We made a case for investors to lean back into equity exposures and significantly upgraded credit, with the sharp widening of spreads more than offsetting the risks of defaults and rating downgrades then. We introduced inflation-linked bonds to portfolios – a view that has become markedly more pronounced in our latest update. The size and scope of the policy response has driven the rebound in risk assets from the March lows – and it has also led to another revamp of our views. Our latest asset views – shown by the dots toward the right on each chart below – have moved to a substantial underweight in developed market government bonds and overweight in inflation-linked bonds. We are now mildly underweight global investment grade credit and equities after the sharp rebound in valuations, preferring high yield for income. We still see an important role for private markets and Chinese assets playing in strategic portfolios. Eyes on inflation We are in the midst of a policy revolution across many dimensions – central banks are bypassing the financial system to “go direct” to businesses and consumers, the lines between fiscal and monetary policy have been blurred, and there is greater government intervention in markets and in corporate governance. Such an unprecedented policy response was needed to stave off permanent economic scarring from the pandemic. Yet the impact of the policy revolution is likely to be much longer lasting than just a few quarters. One potential consequence of the policy revolution that could become an important driver of strategic and tactical asset allocation views is the likelihood of higher inflation in the medium term. A higher inflation regimeMarket implied rates of forward U.S. inflation vs. BlackRock inflation estimate, August 2020 Forward-looking estimates may not come to pass.Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute and the Federal Reserve with data from Refinitiv Datastream. August 2020. Notes: The chart shows market pricing of expected average inflation over the five-year period starting in 2025. We show using the five-year/five-year inflation swap that shows market expectations of average five-year forward inflation five years from now. The orange dot shows our current estimate of average U.S. CPI for the same five-year period i.e. 2025-2030. The near-term focus on the disinflationary forces of the demand shock in the aftermath of Covid-19 misses the bigger picture in our view. The impetus for higher inflation in coming years is likely to come from fiscally expansionary policies rather than monetary policy unlike over the past decade. At the same time, both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are conducting strategy reviews that are poised to shift their reaction functions to tolerate higher inflation and make up for past misses. Add to this forces such as deglobalization that amount to a negative supply shock and inflation expectations could start to ratchet higher. The build-up of debt to pay for fiscal packages means it will likely be politically more palatable for economies to inflate their way out of debt rather than reintroduce austerity measures. All of the above suggests to us that we are poised for a shift to a regime of higher – and more uncertain – inflation from one marked by low and stable inflation. Our expectation for U.S. average inflation in the medium term is significantly higher than current market pricing. See the chart below. We believe increased fiscal and monetary policy coordination – without a clear exit strategy and proper guardrails – raises the risk of uncontrolled deficit spending and monetary expansion, potentially leading to higher inflation as we outlined in Policy revolution. This is not our base case but bears monitoring in coming years. The policy revolution’s most direct impact on our asset views? Reinforcing our underweight on developed market (DM) government bonds. Their role as portfolio ballast against equity selloffs is challenged at yields near perceived lower bounds, as we argued last year in Bonds and ballast: testing the limits. Now, interest rates have been pressed further to the floor. Yield curve control – already rolled out in some countries and being openly debated in others – could effectively keep government bond yields stuck near lower bounds, reducing volatility and the range of return outcomes. Our portfolio construction process now accounts for the existence of effective lower bounds on yields. The diversification appeal of nominal government bonds in portfolios dwindles when yields are close to their assumed lower bounds. What assets could play the role of portfolio ballast instead? There is no one-for-one alternative – no other asset class offers the same liquidity and depth. We still see a role for government bonds but prefer a more targeted approach. We believe a mix of other assets will need to be used in conjunction, underscoring the importance of taking a cross-asset, whole portfolio view to resilience. Gold has caught investors’ attention as a potential inflationary hedge. The precious metals rally is perhaps indicative of the investors seeing inflationary pressures build and seeking out alternative risk-off hedges. Yet we see gold as more driven by sentiment and hence more akin to a tactical call. We prefer other assets to build longer-term resilience such as inflation-linked bonds that could offer the added benefit of being negatively correlated with equities in an environment where nominal yields are capped. Private markets could also play a role as the asset class affords investors the ability to shape more bespoke exposures not typically found in public markets. Challenging corporate fundamentals A significantly changed economic and policy landscape filters through to corporate fundamentals in a myriad of ways. Our CMAs across asset classes have changed significantly since the update at the end of 2019 that reflected a very different outlook than the one facing investors today. Valuations – the primary driver of long-run returns, in our view – have seen extraordinary moves in just two quarters. Such swings inevitably lead to sizeable shifts in expected returns – and asset preferences – even for strategic horizons. We break down the contributors to equity and credit returns for our latest update and contrast them with the prior two quarters in the chart below. Breaking down our expected returns This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance.. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, data as of 30 June 2020. Notes: Chart shows the contributors of our 5-year forward expected returns for US high yield and US equities as reported at 31 Dec 2019 (Q4 2019) at 14 April 2020 (Q1 2020) and at 30 June 2020 (Q2 2020). For high yield, the total expected return is broken down into expected loss due to default and downgrades and expected returns due to carry, valuation and rolldown or reinvestments of coupon income. For equities, the total return is broken down into repricing due to changes in interest rates, changes in the equity risk premium and the impact of changing macroeconomic assumptions such as growth and inflation (fundamentals), earnings growth expectations and dividend yields. Indexes used: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield Index and MSCI USA. Indexes are unmanaged and not subject to fees. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. There can be no guarantee that any forecasts made will come to pass. Equity and credit markets have scrambled to digest the post Covid-19 landscape without a clear historical playbook or much company guidance. We have meaningfully downgraded the outlook for corporate fundamentals. See the right panel below. We slashed our earnings estimates beyond the near-term consensus view, particularly in more cyclical markets to mirror our economic outlook. Yet equity market pricing also depends on the longer-term impact on earnings relative to prior expectations. We see a sharp earnings shock in 2020 and a gradual recovery over several years to pre Covid-19 levels. But the deepest blow is likely behind us, in our view. The recovery in earnings now depends on the restart of economic activity globally and successful implementation of policy stimulus. The “even lower for even longer” outlook for interest rates is broadly supportive of equity valuations, in our view. An important element of the portfolio revolution we discussed earlier has been greater government intervention in the private sector. For example, some companies that have accepted state funding during the pandemic are restricted in paying dividends and share repurchases. This year’s cuts in dividends payouts have reduced equity income at a time when income from bonds is anaemic at best. The key will be how persistent such cuts are and when payouts can resume. Dividend payouts have historically recovered quickly, but this is not a normal downturn and the government intervention we are seeing raises the risk of a slower recovery in dividends payouts. Defaults and rating downgrades are likely to rise in the more challenging economic landscape – a key reason for higher assumed losses across our expected returns for credit. See the left panel below. The significant widening in credit spreads offset the increase in expected losses at the end of the first quarter, spurring our upbeat view on credit and an overall overweight on the asset class. The starting point for credit – particularly investment grade – is trickier at the end of Q2 given the swift repricing in the past few months. Spreads have tightened significantly since March, buoyed by unprecedented central bank bond purchases that have buoyed risk sentiment. We have cut our overweight stance on investment grade credit – and on credit overall. We still like high yield credit for its income potential in a low-return world, keeping us overall neutral on the broader asset class. Revamping the whole portfolio We have long emphasized that the strategic asset allocation decision is the most important driver of whole portfolio returns. This is even more pertinent with Covid-19 fundamentally reshaping the investment landscape. Anchoring investment views to the past is becoming less relevant as structural trends such as rising inequality, deglobalization, the policy revolution and sustainability race toward us. Our CMAs – the linchpin of our strategic asset class preferences – capture the effects of these structural shifts on future asset returns. Our strategic asset views represent the real portfolio implications of our CMAs and our latest research. The chart below shows our current unconstrained U.S. SAA on a 10-year horizon with and without private markets. We contrast this against a representative multi-asset portfolio with a similar risk profile. This portfolio – based on a BlackRock industry survey – is intended only as an approximate guide of average industry practice and is not an actual portfolio.

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, August 2020. Data as of 30 June 2020. Notes: The bar charts on the left show our hypothetical, unconstrained, US dollar-denominated equity-bond SAA built using our portfolio construction approach and CMAs for August 2020. The middle bar assumes private markets are excluded from the investable universe. The U.S. representative multi-asset portfolio shows the average of a client survey conducted by the BlackRock U.S. Wealth Advisory group. The survey comprises 3,319 advisor models with a similar risk target of 8% and similar objectives as our unconstrained SAA. The allocation is illustrative only, and intended to be an approximate guide of average industry practice. It does not represent any actual portfolio. Global government bonds and EM equity allocations include respective China assets. Income private markets include infrastructure debt, direct lending, real estate mezzanine debt and US core real estate. Growth private markets include global private equity buyouts and infrastructure equity. The hypothetical portfolio may differ from those in other jurisdictions, is intended for information purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Index proxies are in the appendix. Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. A few distinguishing features of our SAA: Private markets: They are a source of attractive returns and a source of resilience during times of public market volatility, in our view. One lesson from the GFC was that flexible portfolio construction allows private market investors to capitalize on market dislocations. We have shown in the past how institutional investors may have room for relatively large allocations, depending on risk tolerance. Private markets may not be suitable for all investor types, particularly those with high liquidity needs such as mature defined benefit pensions. They are also a highly complex asset class that typically entail higher governance costs because of due diligence and assembling a large team of specialists. Certain private market assets also have a relatively short history making performance during downturns harder to assess. The ultimate sizing of private markets is highly dependent on investor-specific objectives. Geographical diversification: One pillar of our investment outlook is that global growth will increasingly be led by two poles – one that is U.S.-centric and one China-centric. We believe deliberate geographic equity exposures - balanced across regions tied to the U.S. and China - are vital for real portfolio resilience in a deglobalizing world. We believe China is under-represented in global indexes – and a benchmark-weighted strategic allocation to China based on current index weights would amount to an effective underweight. We believe those allocations should be significantly higher: we are overweight Chinese government bonds and prefer Chinese equities to DM peers. Sustainability: The pandemic has also underscored our belief that sustainability is an important return driver and that ‘green’ companies should be resilient in adverse markets while also having upside return potential. We think sustainability isn’t yet fully appreciated or priced in markets. Rather, it will drive investment flows and repricing in decades to come. We plan to publish work on incorporating sustainability directly into our CMAs in coming months. Our bottom-line: We hold more private markets, both growth and income. One reason for our lower allocations to public equity and credit relative to the representative portfolios is that we prefer opportunities in private markets where our allocations are materially higher. If private markets were excluded from the investable universe that allocation would largely go back into DM equities as see in the middle bar below. We prefer a smaller allocation to nominal DM government bonds and investment grade credit, but a larger allocation to inflation-linked bonds. Finally, our equity exposure is tilted more toward emerging markets. See our interactive CMA website for full details. Download report '},\n",

       "  'description': 'Water stress is a risk often overlooked by investors. We explain its causes, why the problem is likely to intensify in the decades ahead - and sketch out financial implications for portfolios.',\n",
       "  'content': ' An understated risk The global pandemic has reinforced the importance of resilience in investment portfolios. This includes sustainability-related risks that investors may have been underappreciating, ranging from vulnerable global supply chains to health and safety issues. We believe increased asset flows into sustainable investing strategies in 2020 are part of a tectonic shift that could last decades. Physical risks posed by climate events – ranging from hurricanes to wildfires – have captured growing attention in the investment community. We zeroed in on these risks in Getting physical of April 2019, painting a granular picture of the financial implications across municipal bonds, commercial real estate and U.S. utility equities. In this piece, we extend our work on physical risks to water stress. What do we mean by water risk? One in four people globally live in regions at high risk of scarcity – with water demand exceeding supply – according to the World Resources Institute (WRI). This creates financial risks that investors today may not be pricing in. Examples include rising spending needs (to raise efficiency and meet tough regulations) and the cost of production disruptions (unavailability of water for agriculture or cooling power plants). Regulators are zeroing on such risks: A recent European Central Bank report included water stress among the physical climate risks it may require financial institutions to manage and disclose. Water: A scarce resource In past decades, the global demand for water has been increasing at a pace of 1% annually, according to the United Nations’ 2018 World Water Development Report, as growing urban populations strain resources. At the same time, climate change shifts the distribution of water supply by disrupting precipitation patterns. Higher water stress levels indicate greater competition among users. This increases the costs of sourcing, and forces conservation measures. Other factors behind this stress include lax environmental rules and pollution, which can reduce water quality and limit its potential use. Competition for waterEstimated water stress around the world by risk zone, 2030 Source: BlackRock Investment Institute and BlackRock Sustainable Investing, with data from WRI. Notes: WRI defines water stress as the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies. Higher water stress levels indicate more competition among water users. Water withdrawals include those from irrigation, livestock, industrial use, and domestic sectors. Available supplies capture natural runoff as well as the impact of upstream water use and dam operations on downstream water availability. Water stress is assessed on WRI’s five point scale, ranging from “low” to “extremely high” (1 to 5). The geographic variation in climate patterns and human demand for water, together with changes caused by rising global temperatures, result in great variation in the distribution of water stress around the world. The graphic above uses WRI projections that rank geographies’ water stress from “low” to “extremely high” as of 2030. India, the Middle East, northern and southern Africa, Australia, and the U.S. Southwest stand out as likely high risk zones within a decade of today. Key findings Water stress has financial implications. Companies with production facilities in stressed regions may face greater operating costs and insurance premiums. They will likely need to spend more on efficiency measures, recycling and conservation – to meet stringent regulations that could tighten even further. In the real estate market, tenant preferences are likely to shift toward green buildings. We use global real estate investment trusts (REITs) to illustrate how exposure to water stress can vary by location and over time. Our approach combines the geolocation of about 84,000 global REIT properties and mapping them to the 590 publicly listed REITs that own them. We then used the WRI’s “Aqueduct” model to assess REITs exposure to various water stress risks today and in the future. This provides deeper insights on water-related issues faced by companies than traditional assessments, in our view. The risks are not unique to real estate – and we see our approach as applicable across asset classes. Stress in SouthwestEstimated water stress in the U.S. by risk zone Source: BlackRock Investment Institute and BlackRock Sustainable Investing, with data from WRI and SNL, May 2020. The chart shows estimated water stress levels across the U.S. Southwest as of 2014 (actual) and 2030 (projected), using WRI data. Grey dots indicate properties held by listed global REITs, as identified by BlackRock using SNL’s database. Water stress is assessed on WRI’s five point scale, ranging from “low” to “extremely high” (1 to 5). We use the U.S. Southwest to illustrate our methodology. We use 2014 (actual) as our baseline because WRI’s data draw on an extensive modeling and simulation project ran by Utrecht University that spanned 1960-2014. This data represents the most recent and accurate global picture of water stress available, we believe. Key assumptions: Almost the entire U.S. Southwest, including states such as California, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, faces extreme water stress issues by 2030. Most of the current REIT properties in the region, indicated by the grey dots, lie in these high risk zones. Roughly 60% of the global REIT properties we were able to geolocate will experience high water stress by 2030, we find, driven by increased urbanization and the effects of climate change. This is more than double the number today. Water-related issues are not yet a material cash-flow driver for REITs, in our view, and the risks can be mitigated. Yet they may become more material over time due to knock-on effects such as regulatory shifts. Almost all REIT properties in Malaysia, Philippines, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia will likely be in high risk water zones by 2030, our analysis shows. Roughly two-thirds of today’s U.S. REIT properties will be at high risk of water stress by 2030, double the proportion today, we also conclude. Investors and tenants are increasingly focused on water stress, as well as other environmental factors such as energy efficiency, green certifications and carbon footprints. REITs that score highly on these metrics can potentially save costs, while screening as more “green.” This may make their equities more attractive to potential investors and their buildings more desirable for occupants. Water stress has wide-ranging implications across asset classes. We show how the agriculture, electric power and food and beverage industries may be most at risk. The creditworthiness of some countries, states and municipalities facing shortages could also come under threat as they face additional costs to fortify their water infrastructure. This comes on top of other growing physical climate risks such as exposure to flooding and other extreme weather events. Companies resilient to water stress and other climate-related risks may fetch a premium in the transition to a more sustainable world, we believe. Better understanding and quantifying the risks can help investors mitigate exposures and potentially exploit any mispricing. Related data and insights are valuable tools for investors to engage with companies and issuers on their sustainability-related efforts. Widening the lens How might the analysis be extended beyond REITs? Our geolocation-based approach can also be applied to unlisted real estate – and a host of other asset classes and sectors, we believe. The materiality of stress varies greatly across industries, as the Who’s at risk? graphic below shows. Relatively high water users such as the agricultural, electric power, and food and beverage sectors are among the biggest hot spots, this analysis from the WRI suggests. Who’s at risk?

Note: The chart shows the materiality across industries of various physical risks related to the quantity of water supply (too little or too much). The scale ranges from not relevant (white), to low (lightest tone) and very high (darkest tone). WRI’s weights are based on information provided in corporate water disclosure reports and input from industry experts. For details on the methodology see Hofste, R., S. Kuzma, S. Walker, E.H.

For illustrative purposes only. The matrix assesses the materiality of various facets of water risk – ranging from baseline stress to coastal flooding and droughts – across industries. The focus here in on risks related to water quantity – either too much or too little. It does not address the full spectrum of water-related risks. Other components include risks related to declining quality (water that is unfit for use); as well as reputational and regulatory risks (such as conflicts with the public over poor management of wastewater). This illustrates the complexity of assessing risks across sectors – and the need to go beyond headline data. Yet we see it as a valuable starting point for assessing materiality of water stress across sectors. The impacts could be dire in the agricultural sector, with a direct link between water availability for irrigation and crop yields. Irrigated agriculture is, on average, at least twice as productive per unit of land as rainfed agriculture, according to the World Bank. Lack of water availability for cooling thermal power plants poses a serious risk to electric utilities. Some 27% of U.S. electric production would be severely impacted by steady increases in water stress by 2030, according to a 2017 study in Nature. Cities and municipalities in water stressed regions may also face investment costs on wastewater recycling and fortifying their infrastructure. This has implications for the debt of governments and municipalities. Moody’s, for example, said in a report in early 2020 that climate-related risks posed long-term risks to the creditworthiness of the greater-Sydney region in Australia. It identified water stress as the single greatest challenge. Challenges we plan to tackle include applying our analysis on water stress to companies with global supply chains. This would require a dataset identifying the location of all operating facilities of a firm so that the full exposure of companies – and their securities – can be determined. Our understanding of the connection between climate risk and financial risk is evolving – and further research is needed to quantify effects with greater confidence. To be sure, rising water stress is not a one-way street. It can possibly be mitigated through breakthroughs such as better irrigation and wastewater treatment, and advances in efficiency and desalination. Yet we have high conviction that water stress is a key component of climate risks that are set to grow increasingly financially material over time. This suggests the time to integrate them into investment processes is now. The financial implications Industrial and commercial activity accounts for the bulk of freshwater use around the world. The agricultural, textile, energy, industrials, chemicals, pharmaceutical and mining industries account for around 70% of usage, according to CDP’s 2018 Global water report. Residential and office use are part of the remaining 30%. The financial implications of reduced water availability are varied. Companies in water-stressed locations can face costs from disrupted production, higher capital expenditures, compliance and enforcement penalties. They may need to spend more to mitigate the effects of water stress, such as investments in efficiency, pollution abatement, re-use, recycling and conservation measures. The takeaway for investors: Companies that manage water resources better than their peers may offer more resilient earnings streams. The risks cut across sectors. Lack of water for irrigation and animal consumption threatens the food industry. Insufficient cooling water can cause brownouts in electric power plants, hurting electric utilities and their customers. Even the leisure industry may be affected: shortages in India in 2019 forced hotel closures. Water stress is expected to intensify in the decades ahead, in line with many of the other physical risks posed by climate change that we outlined in Getting physical of April 2019. One in two people will live in water-stressed locations by 2030, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) expects. Global water infrastructure costs are expected to rise fourfold to $150 billion annually from 2017 levels by 2030, the World Bank estimates. Who’s vulnerable?Water stress exposure by REIT market, 2014 vs. 2030 Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from SNL and WRI, June 2020. Notes: The chart shows the percentage of REIT properties in the top-20 global REIT markets that lie in regions with high water stress (zones 4 and 5 according to WRI’s framework), both as of 2014 (baseline) and 2030. Projections are based on WRI data. We used the SNL database to geolocate around 85,000 global REIT properties owned by listed companies. For illustrative purposes only. Forward-looking estimates may not come to pass. The chart above illustrates how this may play out in the global REITs Industry. Less than 30% of REIT properties today lie in regions with high water stress, according to WRI data. That proportion could more than double by 2030, assuming the footprint of REIT properties remains unchanged. Download full report '},\n",

       "  'description': 'A historic U.S. fiscal package to cushion the virus impact represents the decisive policy action we have called for.',\n",
       "  'content': ' U.S. policymakers have announced a fiscal package of more than $2 trillion, as well as extraordinary Federal Reserve measures to cushion the economic and market impact of the coronavirus shock. The combined actions are unprecedented in their size – and in the degree of coordination between monetary and fiscal authorities. They represent the type of decisive policy response we have been calling for – and set the scene for an eventual economic recovery. The rapid shutdown of the world’s largest economy in an effort to contain the coronavirus spread was threatening to set in motion a vicious circle: disrupted cash flows lead to rising defaults, making it harder for banks to extend credit. This credit crunch, in turn, could accelerate bankruptcies. The U.S. fiscal stimulus – larger than that delivered in the global financial crisis – includes direct cash payments to households, backstops for small-and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), a historic expansion of unemployment benefits, and large-scale support for corporate credit and market functioning alongside the Fed. Implementation of both health and fiscal measures will be key to ensure they have the desired effect. The Fed’s “whatever-it-takes” actions include a commitment to massively expand its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, lending programs to directly support SMEs, states and municipalities, and buying U.S. corporate bonds for the first time. The U.S response follows coordinated fiscal and monetary action in Australia, Canada and the UK, and a patchwork of fiscal stimulus supported by monetary policy in the euro area. Governments disburse funds to provide a financial bridge to households and businesses. Central banks will be called upon so that interest rates don’t rise in an uncontrolled way amid the largest peacetime relief program ever seen. This makes the type of policy coordination we called for last year essential. It entails large-scale asset purchases, including the Fed announcing open-ended buying of U.S. Treasuries and mortgages. Keeping long-term rates in check is critical. Explicit yield curve control is one way to do this, as the Bank of Japan has shown. Once we better understand the scale and impact of the outbreak, the policy response is paving the road for an eventual – and strong – economic and market rebound. Market moves in recent weeks have been reminiscent of the financial crisis – and have likely thrown many portfolios below their benchmark weights in risk assets. For long-term investors, significant value has been created. We favor rebalancing toward broad asset class benchmark weights to regain an overall neutral stance. Within equities, we prefer the U.S. on the strength of the policy response and the market’s quality characteristics. Download now '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Global markets have taken fright at the scale of potential economic damage wrought by the coronavirus containment measures. We see the economy coming to a near standstill – but expect activity to ultimately return with limited permanent economic damage as long as authorities deliver an overwhelming fiscal and monetary policy response to bridge businesses and households through the shock. That is starting to happen. The pledged policy response has been swift – and we expect total fiscal stimulus to be similar in size to that of the financial crisis but in a shorter timeframe. We believe market volatility is distracting from the sheer amount of promised stimulus – with more to come. The numbers are changing day by day, reflecting real-time updates of the potential depth of the economic hit. U.S. officials went from talk of minimal stimulus to more than $1 trillion –or about 5% of GDP. The plan calls for measures we had advocated: going direct, or relieving the cash flow pressures facing households and businesses especially smaller firms –with money handouts. The European Union has pledged 1% of GDP, with individual countries signaling larger amounts and financial guarantees ranging from 10% of GDP to unlimited liquidity support. Fiscal policy is the frontline of policy action and should focus on boosting public health measures and alleviating potential cash flow crunches through liquidity bridges. The UK, Canada and Australia have served as models for coordination between fiscal and monetary policy. For central banks, the critical focus is alleviating the dysfunction of market pricing and tightening of financial conditions. The Federal Reserve has unleashed an array of liquidity and new facilities to unclog the pipes of the financial system. The European Central Bank put together a bolder response after its communication mishap last week, launching a €750 billion bond buying programme. European officials may also activate the European Stability Mechanism on relaxed terms to free up even more bond-buying capacity. Markets, in our view, will ultimately settle down if three conditions are met: 1) visibility on the ultimate scale of the coronavirus outbreak and evidence the infection rate has peaked over the long term; 2) deployment of credible and coordinated policy packages; and 3) confidence that financial markets are functioning properly. Once we better understand the scale and impact of the outbreak, the policy response is setting the stage for an eventual – and strong – recovery. This is why we stay neutral on risk assets and believe investors should take a long-term perspective. We emphasize portfolio resilience through a benchmark allocation to government bonds, quality equities, cash and sustainable investing. For long-term investors, significant value has been created in risk assets. Download now '},\n",

       "  'content': ' The virus shock’s impact will be likely be large and sharp, but we believe investors should be level headed , take a long term perspective and stay invested. The scale of financial market moves in response to the coronavirus outbreak has been reminiscent of the global financial crisis. We do not think this is 2008, however. The virus shock’s impact will be likely be large and sharp, but we believe investors should be level-headed, take a long-term perspective and stay invested. The economic and financial backdrop today is much stronger today than going into the crisis of 2008. We don’t see this as an expansion-ending event - provided that a pre-emptive and coordinated policy response is delivered. And we see encouraging signs that this policy response is starting to come together. It will need to be a joint and decisive effort between fiscal and monetary policy, as detailed in Time for policy to go direct. The key vulnerabilities that need to be addressed: cash challenges faced by companies, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, and households. The BlackRock Investment Institute changed its moderately pro-risk stance to neutral two weeks ago as the coronavirus outbreak began spreading across the globe. Authorities have strong incentives to take aggressive public health measures to prevent the virus from spreading due to capacity constraints in the health care sector. This will likely result in a sharp and deep economic slowdown in the near term. Market moves have been compounded by oil prices plunging more than 20% – on track for the biggest daily drop since in the early 1990s – as an OPEC pact to stabilize prices unraveled. This should ultimately benefit growth, but it also risks at least temporary financial and economic dislocations in energy-heavy sectors, such as emerging market commodity exporters and parts of U.S. high yield. This is a time for investors to keep a long-term perspective. The ultimate depth and duration of the coronavirus’ economic impact are highly uncertain, but we still believe the shock should be temporary as the outbreak will eventually dissipate and economic activity will normalize – assuming the needed policy response is delivered. We stay at benchmark weights for equities, and overweight the more defensive quality and minimum volatility style factors. We favor portfolio resilience, including cash and sustainable investing strategies, and still prefer U.S. Treasuries over lower-yielding peers for portfolio ballast. We recognize Treasury allocations are playing their role during moments of high uncertainty, but see risks of a diminishing buffer against equity market sell-offs and a snap-back in yields from historically low levels.

       "  'content': ' We outline the need for a decisive, pre-emptive and coordinated policy response to the coronavirus shock. The future evolution and global spread of the coronavirus outbreak is highly uncertain. What we know is that containment and social distancing are ultimately achieved by reducing economic activity. Faced with resource constraints in healthcare systems, there are strong incentives to take aggressive containment measures to slow the spreading. The impact on economic activity will likely be sharp – and could be deep. The depth and duration of the economic impact is uncertain but should be temporary as the outbreak itself will eventually dissipate. That requires a decisive, pre-emptive and coordinated policy response to avoid the disruptions to income streams and financial flows that could cause persistent economic damage – and end the cycle. We wrote in August 2019 about the nearly exhausted monetary policy toolbox and the challenges it poses for dealing with the next downturn. This has now come to the fore – and that’s why it is time to go direct with policy support. Simply using up the limited monetary policy space remaining – interest rates, forward guidance or even quantitative easing – could quickly put the macro focus on the lack of tools left and thus backfire. The only way to address this is to add further lines of defense and make fiscal policy an explicit part of the crisis response toolkit. The first step is to provide frontline public health agencies with necessary financial resources. But a joint effort between monetary and fiscal policy is required to avoid a raft of financial failures at the grassroot level due to demand shortfalls, production disruptions or payment delays that can all lead to cash flow squeezes. Small- and medium-sized enterprises, for example, risk having cash flows cut off if they have to rely solely on support through financial markets. That is why any solutions will need to involve “going direct” with policy – that is, more directly relieving the cash flow pressures facing some sectors of the economy. Authorities in all major economies have to fast-track sizeable, comprehensive and flexible support programs to pre-emptively provide direct financial support to companies and households facing a short-term loss of income. That would prevent these temporary disruptions from turning into a full-blown global recession. Deploying these programs will involve coordination of monetary and fiscal policy. Recognizing that these measures will be temporary justifies an aggressive policy response. The experience of the global financial crisis and aftermath shows that the policy effectiveness would be greatly enhanced if the international community approached these measures as a deliberate package delivered in a coordinated fashion. A comprehensive global response should have the following elements: First, to support households, fiscal measures could also include generous sick-pay support and short-time work schemes to stabilize incomes and to limit job losses – especially where such arrangements were not available before. Several countries are already preparing such measures. Income support can come via adjustments to welfare and labor market programs, such as unemployment insurance. Welfare programs could also be tweaked by temporarily enhancing benefits and reducing waiting times until citizens become eligible. Direct payments to affected households are also an option. Second, to support companies, fiscal authorities could suspend collection of tax revenues and social security contributions to provide temporary cash flow relief to firms and the self-employed while at the same time accelerating outgoing public payments and reducing unpaid bills to the private sector. In some instances, cash grants via local governments and natural disaster relief agencies might be required beyond loans. These are ways to directly provide some relief to company balance sheets that can be quickly implemented within current government programs. Automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to work fully and, if needed, existing fiscal rules could be temporarily suspended. Third, monetary authorities should also be ready to deploy more direct and targeted liquidity support, including expanding funding-for-lending facilities – providing liquidity to commercial banks that is earmarked specifically for lending to corporates hurt by the virus outbreak. Government guarantees can help cover any bank lending at preferential rates to meet the corporate sector’s need for additional working capital. Alternatively, state-owned development banks could be used as a conduit for such lending. In countries with weaker public finances, asset purchase programs could safeguard the government’s funding conditions. A decisive and pre-emptive policy response is essential given the uncertainty around what will likely be material near-term disruptions due to the coronavirus outbreak. For the most part these measures will be fiscal in nature – and some will require coordination between fiscal and monetary authorities. Monetary policy should focus on preventing an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions and ensure the functioning of financial markets. Central banks going it alone with interest rate cuts risk wasting precious policy ammunition. We believe decisive policy action now would help avoid opening the door to more radical ideas and uncontrolled fiscal spending.

       "  'description': 'Jean Boivin, Head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, discusses why sustainability will change the way investors build portfolios going forward.',\n",
       "  'content': ' A commonly held view is that a return sacrifice is needed when adopting sustainable investing. We disagree – and in fact believe the opposite is true. We believe there is a fundamental point that is often overlooked with sustainable investing. There will likely be long transition unfolding over years and decades, driven by investment flows, that will reshape all asset prices. Because these flows are in their early stages, we believe that the full consequences of a shift to sustainable investing are not yet in market prices – and a return advantage can be gained during this transition. Just getting started The past year has seen a marked shift in society’s attitudes toward sustainability. This shift is spurring political pressure, a regulatory push and technological advancements to create the foundations of a more sustainable world, leading to a change in investor behavior and setting in motion a major yet gradual capital reallocation. Society’s long transition toward the practice of sustainable investing is likely to drive market adjustments for years and even decades. This tectonic shift has significant implications for the expected returns and relative pricing of assets not just those perceived to be sustainable but for every asset in the investment universe. The consequences could not just alter existing return drivers or risk premia but create entirely new sources of premia. One commonly held view argues that sustainable investing is not going to offer much return opportunity to investors from a basic financial theory perspective. This view holds that today’s prices should fully reflect the predictable component of future flows into sustainable assets that is, the adoption of sustainable investing is already at a “steady state” reflected in current prices. We believe the commonly held view is not just wrong but that the opposite will occur. The coming capital reallocation is not yet in prices: this long transition in sustainable preferences and practices will make some assets more expensive (those with high sustainability) and others cheaper (those with low sustainability). This means that assets with high sustainability will be rewarded through the long transition period, the opposite of what others posit. All about the flows There are three channels through which sustainability will change investment: profitability, risk and investor flows. The industry is typically focused on the first two: research has helped quantify the impact of sustainability on profitability and risk in different industries. Yet we believe the third channel is underappreciated – and far more important: the impact of major flows driven by the widespread adoption of sustainable investing during the long transition period. Our argument that flows will drive a “sustainability wave” is about much more than just the idea that today’s youth and their preferences affect market pricing. Though this contributes to the story as we discuss below the sustainability wave and its market impact is about a broader shift in preferences spanning all generations and societies. The sustainability wave is not purely about demographics. But it provides a parallel. Just as the baby boom generation’s impact on the economy and financial markets played out through taste preferences and wealth flows, the sustainability wave will play out over decades, remaking economies and industries as capital is reallocated. One contributing factor to the wave is, however, demographically induced: an ongoing transfer of wealth to a younger generation with greater awareness of sustainability. Millennials and Gen Xers are expected to gain a major share of assets. Some might argue that the younger generation’s preference for sustainability may dampen if not reverse as they age. Yet academic literature underscores that the personal experiences of economic fluctuations play an important role in persistently shaping individual preferences, especially at a younger age. As our paper Getting physical highlights, the number of natural disasters causing U.S. $1 billion plus in damages has been on a steady rise. Major negative shocks related to sustainability from hurricanes and wildfires in the U.S. and Australia, heat waves in Europe and flooding around the world may result in a durable shift in the younger generation’s taste towards more sustainable assets. A systematic approach While the transition period toward a new steady state could last decades, the resulting returns we expect during the transition should impact the strategic asset allocations built today. To meet these challenges, a portfolio construction framework needs to allow for: The impact of climate change and other sustainability effects on fundamental macro variables A clear link between the impact of these altered macro variables and the risk and return for all assets A means of allowing for the time-varying nature of the return and risk impact The creation of new sustainability premia that involves identifying factors that exhibit the sustainability premia and discounts within and across various asset classes A systematic means of building portfolios to reflect the inherent uncertainty applied to all future estimates Deriving a set of factors and rewards to sustainability – from which to create these new CMAs – is not trivial. Our flows-based concept is intuitive and drives the sustainability premia. The challenge is quantifying the impact. Our argument is built on the idea that what’s priced now doesn’t reflect what will be priced in the future. We instead identify exposures that capture sustainability using BlackRock’s proprietary sustainability metrics across asset classes. In our framework, whether these metrics have historically explained returns is secondary to whether they capture sustainability. To these identified exposures, we would ascribe a reward or discount by combining estimates of steady-state premia and the time-varying return impacts of the transition period until that steady state is reached. While quantification of this is difficult, there are different parallels from history that are informative. The pace at which markets price in slow-moving effects has precedent.

       "  'description': 'We are reducing our overweight equity and credit exposures due to coronavirus outbreaks but maintain benchmark holdings.',\n",
       "  'content': ' We still see the U.S. and global expansion as intact. But the risk is that a broadening of the outbreak undermines fundamentals and triggers a premature end to the economic cycle. Global markets have been roiled by fears over the impact of the coronavirus outbreaks, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hitting record lows and the S&P 500 Index on track for its largest weekly decline since the global financial crisis. We are reducing our global equity and credit exposure to neutral from modestly overweight on a 12-month horizon. The speed and scale of the equity slide shows that markets have already reflected much potential economic impact. That is why we maintain benchmark exposures but think it’s too soon to add risk. The spread of coronavirus outbreaks beyond China has opened up a new global dimension to the epidemic – and potential for a sharper contraction from efforts to contain it. Yet we expect the expansion to remain intact. We see a sharp rebound once potential disruptions to economic activity dissipate, even if there are now material downside risks to the growth trajectory and risk assets may overshoot to the downside due to the heightened uncertainty. This may push some developed economies toward the brink of a technical recession, notably Japan and the euro area – both regions that were already on the cusp. Our base case: This is a temporary shock, albeit one of unknown depth and duration. But the risk is that the disruptions create liquidity crunches that, if not addressed, could trigger a premature end to the economic cycle. A sustained tightening of financial conditions or impairment to market liquidity could be met by coordinated policy easing by major central banks even though many, such as in the euro area and Japan, have limited policy space. Fiscal policy will likely also be an important part of the toolkit, especially in China, with governments ramping up public health spending and providing relief to the hardest hit industries and regions. We see material risks to global supply chains, concentrated in tech, autos and capital goods. Global trade tensions were already leading companies to reassess supply chains. Over time, these supply shocks risk a shift to a macro regime of slow growth and higher inflation as some of the benefits of globalization unwind. We shift our moderate pro-risk stance to a neutral position. An additional source of financial market uncertainty is the historically wide divergence between the policy agendas of the parties in the U.S. presidential election. We advocate portfolio resilience through the quality and min vol equity factors, the ballast properties of government bonds – especially U.S. Treasuries – and cash. Download now '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Inflation jitters We have been flagging higher inflation since the unprecedented policy response to the pandemic, and this prospect is now driving markets. Our core new nominal theme implies that rising inflation will have more benign market implications than in the past. Central banks are likely to lean against any sharp rises in nominal government bond yields. As a result, real interest rates could stay negative into the medium term. This makes for a positive backdrop for risk assets, and keeps us pro risk with tactical overweights in equities and credit. Yet markets have risen significantly, and we see potential for pullbacks driven by pandemic and vaccine rollout dynamics. Globalization rewired The pandemic has accelerated a rewiring of globalization – with a bipolar U.S.-China world order at its center. We see the new U.S. administration bringing greater predictability in trade policies. Climate is likely to become a central policy priority – and an area for potential U.S.-China cooperation. Yet economic, technological and strategic competition with China looks here to stay – and we believe investors need exposures to both poles of global growth. Rising debt A spike in government debt to record levels – a result of a policy revolution in cooperation between fiscal and monetary authorities – was a necessary response to the Covid shock. It may be politically tough for governments to unwind large-scale fiscal support, and the perceived safety premium for holding government bonds could eventually erode. But we are not concerned about these dynamics in the near term as central banks face pressures to maintain a stable, low-rate environment, keeping a lid on debt servicing costs. Unprecedented response The joint fiscal-monetary policy revolution has delivered historic support to help bridge economies to a post-pandemic world when vaccines become more widely available. We have seen an unprecedented rise in peacetime spending, with discretionary fiscal stimulus far exceeding what we saw after the global financial crisis (GFC). The increase in debt under the current shock also exceeds that of the GFC, even in the absence of large-scale bailouts this time. This has happened against a backdrop of much higher debt levels than a decade ago. As a result, debt-to-GDP ratios have soared to record levels globally. Key risks ahead Fiscal and financial dominance are key risks that could be mutually reinforcing. It could become politically difficult for governments to unwind large-scale fiscal support. And raising interest rates will become more politically fraught for central banks against a backdrop of high debt levels. Even a courageous central bank may end up having to backtrack if an attempt to normalize policy were to result in a “taper tantrum” event that significantly tightened financial conditions. A bipolar world order The pandemic has accelerated a rewiring of globalization – with a bipolar U.S.-China world order at its center. We see the Biden administration as bringing greater predictability and taking a different approach on trade and climate policy. Yet overall tensions with China appear set to stay elevated amid ongoing economic, technological and strategic competition – and we believe investors need exposures to both poles of global growth. Globalization rewired, one of the three key investment themes introduced in our 2021 Global Outlook, is about an acceleration of geopolitical transformations. At its center: a bi-polar U.S.-China world order and the remapping of global supply chains. This is not the same as deglobalization. Clear changes ahead We expect a clear change of tenor and tone in the Biden administration’s foreign policy approach, including a shift to working with allies on key issues: China, Russia, Iran, democracy and cyber security. The Biden administration will likely use alliances with groups of countries to engage China. The nomination of veteran Asia specialist Kurt Campbell to serve the new role of Indo-Pacific Coordinator is a signal of such an approach – as well as the administration’s expectation that intense competition is likely to dominate U.S.-China relations. This is taking place as China has emerged stronger from 2020 with its successful containment of the virus and a lead in the economic restart. It has also signed important trade deals including an investment agreement with the European Union, and a regional free trade agreement with Asia-Pacific nations including Japan and South Korea. Climate action Climate is likely to become a central policy priority under the Biden administration – and an area for potential cooperation in U.S.-China relations amid broader tensions around trade and human rights. Frictions may extend to the financial arena, as evidenced in the forced delisting of some Chinese companies in the U.S. market. We see this as a reason for carefully implementing China exposures, perhaps including consideration of greater direct allocations to China-listed securities over time. Yet how to implement China exposures will depend on investor constraints, including political and legal ones. Portfolio insights Strategically, we see assets exposed to Chinese growth as core holdings that are distinct from emerging market exposures. Tactically, we are overweight Asia ex-Japan equities as many Asian countries have been more effective at containing the virus and are further ahead in the economic restart. Risks to China-exposed assets include China’s high debt levels, currency volatility and heightened U.S.-China conflicts. But we believe investors are well compensated for these. BlackRock’s 2021 investment themes The new nominal We see stronger growth and lower real yields as the vaccine-led restart accelerates and central banks limit nominal yields gains even as inflation expectations climb. Inflation will likely have different implications to the past. Strategic implication: We are underweight government bonds and see equities supported by falling real rates. Tactical implication: Our low rate outlook keeps us pro-risk. We like U.S. equities and prefer high yield for income. The first half of 2021 is likely to be choppy. The pandemic challenges public health and the activity restart, while we see more policy support in the U.S. on top of the recent $900 billion fiscal package. We prefer a barbell approach to risk exposures, with selected cyclicals such as U.S. small-caps and emerging market equities on one end and quality assets including U.S. and Asia ex-Japan equities on the other. We also like tech and healthcare. These sectors can benefit from structural trends turbocharged by the pandemic, in our view, and their strong balance sheets and cash flows help provide some resilience against volatility. Yet we recognize U.S. tech could face challenges from greater regulation and corporate taxes. We remain pro-risk overall, favoring overweights in both equities and credit, but see a potentially bumpy path for asset prices broadly, especially as markets have moved a lot since we published our 2021 global outlook in early December. Globalization rewired Covid-19 has accelerated geopolitical transformations such as a bipolar U.S.-China world order and a remaking of global supply chains, placing greater weight on resilience – even at the expense of efficiency. Strategic implication: We favor deliberate country diversification and above-benchmark China exposures. Tactical implication: We like EM equities, especially Asia ex-Japan, and are underweight Europe and Japan. Turbocharged transformations The pandemic has added fuel to pre-existing structural trends such as an increased focus on sustainability, rising inequality within and across nations, and the dominance of e-commerce at the expense of traditional retail. Strategic implication: We prefer sustainable assets amid a growing societal preference for sustainability. Tactical implication: We take a barbell approach, favoring tech and healthcare as well as selected cyclical exposures. '},\n",

They utilize both fundamental economic and market based approaches to better understand optimal capital allocation in the space.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Below are highlights from the full report which goes into greater detail on our views on optimal emerging markets (EM) allocation.In this Emerging Markets Special Topics commentary, we engage the issue of “What is the optimal emerging markets (EM) allocation in a global portfolio?,” which is a question we are frequently asked by clients and consultants. Unfortunately, there is no one way to answer the question, so here we try to approach it from multiple angles. These include examining both fundamental economic and market-based approaches to sizing an emerging markets allocation. In our view, no matter how you cut it, there is an argument that investors are currently underinvested in EM. All three methods we examine in this commentary suggest that the optimal EM share in global portfolios is well above what most allocators currently hold. GDP-weighted Approach to EM Allocation The first approach we examine posits that the size of EM’s allocation in a global portfolio should reflect its relative size in the global economy. The intuition here is that a portfolio of financial assets should mirror the “real” economic importance of its constituents. As such, there are two ways to measure EM’s relative economic importance: EM’s outright share of global GDP (measured in USD), or alternatively EM’s contribution to global GDP growth. In sum, EM presently accounts for a 41% share of global GDP and has been contributing 43% to each year’s global economic growth. Clearly, in recent decades those numbers are dominated by one country: China. Excluding China, EM’s share in global GDP drops to 23% while its contribution to growth falls to 38%. Mean-variance Optimization Approach to EM Allocation Another approach to estimating the optimal EM allocation is to run traditional mean-variance optimizations using historical returns and volatility. That approach calculates the EM weighting that maximizes return while minimizing volatility. In the calculations, we used monthly return data since 1999 and performed the analysis separately for a pure equity portfolio and for a pure fixed income portfolio. For equities, we built a portfolio that included four indices: U.S. equities (S&P 500), European equities (EUR Stoxx), Japanese equities (the Nikkei index) and Emerging Market Equities (MSCI Emerging Markets index). Moreover, for EM, we ran the analysis separately for a portfolio that includes China and one that excludes it. The results for the analysis are displayed in the full report. The quantitative exercise would suggest that the optimal allocation for an equity portfolio is 8% of EM with China included, and excluding China, the share rises slightly to 9%. Allocation approach based on EM’s share in global market indices The final approach to understanding what the optimal emerging markets portfolio allocation may be examines the share of EM in global indices. Our intuition here is that the asset allocation should arguably be driven by the size of EM tradable securities in global financial markets. The broadest metric we looked at includes the ratio of all listed EM issuers. Using that broad definition, listed EM companies have an equity market capitalization equivalent to 31% of global stock market capitalization, and excluding China, the share is around 16%. In fixed income, EM’s share comes to 23% and 10% if one were to exclude China, according to Bank of America research1. However, in our view, the above metric is too broad since it does not control for liquidity, free-float and issue size. We used MSCI and Bloomberg indices to account for those factors. More specifically, for equities, the data shows that the share of EM in MSCI ACWI comes to 11% (8% excluding China). For fixed income, EM accounts for 12% of the Bloomberg Global Bond Aggregate index (IG, HY, Inflation linked, Munis) and ex-China that ratio drops to 8%. The first approach relies on the “real” economic weight of EM. Unadjusted, the approach pointed to an allocation of 40% for EM (including China). However, our quantitative estimate of growth-detracting adjustments suggested to an optimal EM allocation closer to 30%. The second method, based on optimizations of historical returns and volatility, suggested an EM allocation of around 9% for EM equities and another 10% for fixed income. Finally, the third method looked at EM’s index market share. Adjusted for liquidity and other market depth considerations, the resultant optimal EM allocation is around 12% for both equities and bonds. How do those methods compare to actual holdings by investors? For equities, available data suggest an allocation to EM equities of around 6.4%2. For fixed income, available data3 for European investors suggest an average EM allocation of 5% while for US investors, the estimate is around 1-2%. In a separate analysis of the largest global bond funds holdings, J.P. Morgan found that two-thirds of the funds have less than 10% of AUM in EM government debt4. Therefore, in our view, all three methods above suggest that the optimal share of EM in global portfolios is well above what most allocators currently own. '},\n",

But history is instructive, and it tells us that times of pain can be ideal moments to position for future gains. As the second half begins, we see: Market direction driven by Fed machinations Need for diversification and resilience in equity portfolios An underappreciated opportunity in healthcare stocks Market overview and outlook The first five months of the year marked the worst start for the S&P 500 since 1970 ― and the sixth worst back to 1928.* While caution is warranted, we believe the equity risk premium (ERP) continues to make a case for equities. Stock valuations have come down, but company earnings remain solid. This keeps the ERP ― which compares the earnings yield on the S&P 500 to bond yields ― above its historical average. Our models suggest the 10-year Treasury yield would have to rise to 4% or earnings decline by more than 20% for the perceived “margin of safety” in stocks over bonds to disappear. Earnings will slow, but 20% is hard to imagine, even in a recession. The average earnings drop in prior recessions was 13%, with the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) skewing the results. See chart below. All eyes on earningsS&P 500 earnings decline in recessions, 1957-2020 Playing offense through defense While it is important to maintain a long-term lens, particularly when investing for long-term goals, it is also prudent to protect and position portfolios for the prevailing environment ― a key advantage of active management. Today’s uncertainty argues for a focus on stability and resilience. Waiting on the Fed The Fed’s ability to raise interest rates and reduce its balance sheet in a way that neither inflames inflation nor stifles economic growth will have significant bearing on the market backdrop. We are not calling for a recession, but we are cognizant that the risks of a recession are rising: The Fed is tightening monetary policy, bringing an end to “easy money” policies; 30-year mortgage rates have climbed from 3% last year to nearly 6% today; inflation is beginning to erode household savings; and inventories of goods are elevated as both pandemic-induced supply shortages and voracious demand ease. If the Fed tightens too much, the result could be a recession. If it tightens too little, inflation is the greater threat. The ideal scenario runs in the middle, allowing for a soft landing as policy transitions. We are not placing odds on any particular outcome but are generally positioning more defensively. The optimal portfolio to combat inflation is very different from the optimal portfolio for a recession. We advocate using a barbell strategy to position for these competing outcomes. This includes owning energy and financials as inflation fighters, and healthcare for a dose of resilience. We find other traditionally defensive sectors, including utilities and staples, to be expensive relative to the broader market. The weight of inflation Notably, our analysis of sector dynamics during the Great Inflation period of the 1970s found energy, financials and healthcare to be the top performers. While the backdrop is different today, we do believe these three sectors could outpace the broader market once again, with financials potentially doing even better in this cycle given stronger bank balance sheets after restructuring and rigorous stress testing in the wake of the GFC. Inflation surfaced as the perceived greatest risk to equity markets over the next six months in a BlackRock Fundamental Equities survey of more than 1,000 U.S. investors. See chart below.

Pricing pressures abound Global prices for everything from oil and gasoline to cereal and milk are significantly higher this year, escalating pressure on consumers and companies alike. Median global inflation is nearly 8% vs. approximately 3% a year ago1, and the high absolute level of inflation will have lasting effects. High and persistent inflation can become more difficult to eliminate outside of a recession, and those risks are important to assessing credit fundamentals. No longer a rising tide Regime change is difficult to quantify, especially when it is occurring in real time. And yet the shift in monetary policy of both higher interest rates, an end to asset purchases, and in particular a reduction to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet highlight a significant policy shift in response to the highest inflation levels experienced in 40 years. A variable but persistent tailwind of the last many years which has come to an end, and now we’ll see what businesses are truly ready to withstand tightening financial conditions. Winners and losers As companies react to higher input and financing costs, the idiosyncrasies of individual business models begins to diverge.

Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product\\'s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

       "  'content': ' Read details of our midyear outlook: The Great Moderation is over The Great Moderation, from mid-1980s until 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, was a remarkable period of stability of both growth and inflation. We were in a demand-driven economy with steadily growing supply. Borrowing binges drove overheating, while collapsing spending drove recessions. Central banks could mitigate both by either raising or cutting rates. That period has ended, in our view. Bracing for volatility This new market environment has echoes of the early 1980s. We are bracing for volatility in this regime. Central banks are rushing to raise rates to contain inflation that’s rooted in production constraints. They are not acknowledging the stark trade-off: crush economic growth or live with inflation. The Fed, for one, is likely to choke off the restart of economic activity - and only change course when the damage emerges. We see this driving high macro and market volatility, with short economic cycles. Equities would suffer if rate hikes trigger a growth downturn. If policymakers tolerate more inflation, bond prices would fall. Either way, the macro backdrop is no longer conducive for a sustained bull market in both stocks and bonds, we believe. We see higher risk premia across the board and think portfolio allocations will need to become more granular and nimble. Living with inflation We think we will be living with inflation. For all the noise about containing inflation, we see policymakers ultimately living with some of it. We remain overweight equities and underweight government bonds in long-term portfolios. We expect investors to demand more compensation to hold long-term bonds in this new regime. We see a high risk of growth stalling and reduce equities to underweight. We now prefer to take risk in credit because we don’t see contained default risk. Positioning for net zero We see the bumpy transition to net-zero carbon emissions shaping the new regime – and believe investors should start positioning for net zero. We think investors can be bullish on both fossil fuels and sustainable assets, as we see a key role for commodities in the transition. Yet our work finds that changing societal preferences can give sustainable assets a return advantage for years to come. Ready to shift views We stay pro-equities on a strategic horizon but are underweight in the short run. Biases built up during the Great Moderation, like buying risk asset dips, won’t work as well as before, in our view.

       "  'content': ' Historically, roughly every 30 years, a Category 5 hurricane has made landfall in the United States. Only five such hurricanes have ever made landfall since record-keeping began; such is their rarity. The physical damage that such storms cause is devastating, as evidenced by hurricanes like 2005’s Katrina (which made landfall as a Cat 3), or even 2012’s Sandy in NYC, “just” a Cat 1 storm. Financial hurricanes, on the other hand, can cause devastating monetary losses, even as physical losses are (fortunately) minimal. Today, we find ourselves in the midst of a unique financial hurricane: since at least 2000, there has never been a year when both the Bloomberg-Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and the S&P 500 Index of large capitalization equities were negative (which is where we stand in 2022, as of May 10, see Figure 1), and since the creation of the U.S. Long Treasury Agg in 1973, there hasn’t been a year when both stocks and long bonds were down double digits (as they currently stand this year). While there are still too many unknowns for us to say that this is a Category 5 equivalent, like the Global Financial Crisis or like the Great Depression, it is nonetheless a unique and complex “5 category” hurricane, encompassing: 1) inflation (globally, but especially in the U.S.), 2) China lockdowns (and the evolution of policy), 3) the war in Ukraine (and its impact on commodity prices), 4) recession fears (especially in Europe) and 5) a Federal Reserve (Fed) that is tightening financial conditions at the fastest pace in decades. We will examine each of these categories, in turn, and will conclude with thoughts on how to allocate capital in the midst of this storm, in a sense, how to “polish your surfboard” in preparation for the opportunities that should arise once the tempest has calmed. Figure 1: Stock and bond returns are indicative of a rare financial hurricane this year Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 31, 2022 Inflation (globally, but particularly in the U.S.) There is no shortage of reasons for inflation’s push higher this year – commodity shortages due to the war in Ukraine, continued demand for housing amidst strong fundamentals and low inventory and fresh lockdowns in China creating new waves of supply chain issues. Still, there are reasons to believe that several important components may have already peaked. While Chinese ports are backed up, congestion around U.S. ports has eased. Copper is now below where it was a year ago, and the U.S. oil and gas rig count has almost recovered to pre-Covid levels after plunging by 70% during the pandemic, incentivized by the economics of $100-a-barrel oil this year. House prices are almost certain to slow their advance too, in light of mortgage rates that have now surpassed their 2018 peak. While inflation has shown some signs of peaking, its stickiness at this high a level (2022 is likely to average 6.9% according to the Bloomberg consensus) is still a problem for the Fed, and hence for markets (see Figure 2). Figure 2: 2022 inflation expectations are trending in the wrong direction for the Fed Source: Bloomberg, data as of April 26, 2022 Lockdowns in China, and the evolution of policy The global growth impulse from China is especially complex because while it takes the form of a negative supply shock to the U.S.; it is primarily a negative demand shock in China. City-wide lockdowns have virtually ceased day-to-day activities, leading to renewed disruption and delays at the ports, further clogging parts of the global supply chain (see Figure 3). The unclear trajectory of economic growth, Covid developments, as well as uncertain regulatory and geopolitical conditions surrounding China, have led to a great set of uncertainties for investors. Figure 3: Relentless shipping delays are leading to global cost pressures Sources: Goldman Sachs and Freightos, data as of March 22, 2022 The continuing challenge from the Ukraine-Russia situation Wheat, natural gas, crude oil, and a variety of other commodities continue to be buffeted by the interruption to the global commodity trade. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in European natural gas prices (see Figure 4). This near-immediate breakage of trade relations with a major global trading partner may have instigated a “deglobalization wave” that is now being exacerbated by Chinese lockdowns and their associated supply chain disruptions. This deglobalization wave is also creating a tug-of-war in the composition of nominal GDP (as smaller trade quantities create higher prices), which could create business interruptions, a longer-term stickiness to inflation and hence further geopolitical tensions. Yet, putting geopolitics aside, an investor can justifiably feel more comfortable with investments in areas tangential to this concept of a stickier supply environment for commodities. Figure 4: European natural gas prices are up 440% over the past year Source: Bloomberg, data as of May 2, 2022 Potential U.S. recession? Recession has been a buzzword ever since the yield curve inverted in early 2022. Forecasts suggest that the likelihood of a recession has increased dramatically since the beginning of the year, for both the U.S. and for Europe. Simultaneously, consumer confidence has trended downward, largely due to inflation concerns, an ill omen for consumption-oriented economies. Yet there is a labor market-sized hole in the theory of a U.S. recession. The shortages of goods and commodities from abroad extends to a shortage of workers domestically, creating one of the tightest labor markets in history. Not only does a tight labor market continue to support robust consumption, but ironically, this labor shortage and short-term inflationary impulse creates the need for investment in automation and other productivity-enhancing technology that will ultimately be disinflationary in the long run. While both the labor market and corporate investment activity are highly likely to slow from their unsustainably torrid pace, they are unlikely to grind to a halt. In fact, it is quite likely that the labor market stays strong enough for long enough for tomorrow’s businesses and consumers to enjoy the fruits of today’s investments. Interestingly, the tightest labor market in history is also coinciding with U.S. household financial health that is the best in modern history. While sentiment readings may be poor (e.g., consumer confidence), spending is quite the opposite. Through the pandemic, consumers have, on average, paid down debt and grown cash balances. Households saved about $5 trillion during the pandemic, $2.5 trillion of which is now pent-up excess savings. Through March 2022, households have only drawn down about $30 billion from this $2.5 trillion excess savings hoard, leaving plenty of dry powder to absorb price increases without having to change consumption patterns as much as net debt burdens would have suggested in prior cycles. Figure 5: US households could now theoretically repay all indebtedness with cash Source: Federal Reserve, data as of December 31, 2021 So, the data doesn’t suggest an imminent recession in the U.S., but does policy have to reverse its course of the last three years at a speed that ends up engineering an economic downturn in the fight against inflation? That would seem irrational to us, but markets won’t know the ultimate answer for a few months (making for a highly conditional investing environment, as explained in our last Market Insights commentary (If…Then, Making Sense of Uncertainty in Markets). The U.S. is already feeling some of the effects of the hurricane in the goods economy, albeit in what is a well-built house with a strong foundation. The combination of high goods prices and a natural rotation back to services spending (leading to less goods sector demand) could likely spell a goods recession; the good news for the U.S. is that this is only about 20% of GDP and the strength of the other 80% should be more than enough to offset this weakness at the headline level. Markets like one-word answers to complex problems, and it’s possible they may focus on manufacturing’s implied growth slowdown for a few months, but a manufacturing survey is not the tell-all of a much more complex (and more durable) economy (see Figure 6). Figure 6: High goods prices portend manufacturing slowdowns Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics and Institute for Supply Management, data as of March 31, 2022 However, the situation is much different in Europe and China. While the U.S. economy benefits from its services-heavy makeup, its lack of external exposure and its status as an energy exporter, Europe and China do not enjoy such luxuries. Uncertainty around Eurozone and global earnings adds to the challenges of managing a global portfolio (see Figure 7). Positioning today should reflect the fear of at least some slowing global data pervading investor psyche. While being right about an economic forecast is intellectually gratifying, preserving capital by protecting downside in the short-term, while setting up for future upside (polishing one’s surfboard in a hurricane), is more important than being ultimately right on the timing or depth of a potential economic slowdown. Figure 7: Estimates suggest that 40% global earnings growth could become a 16% contraction Source: Piper Sandler, data as of May 3, 2022 Monetary Policy While the absolute highs of inflation are likely behind us, inflation is still much too high and central banks are still much too far behind the curve. The implications are that the Fed will need to continue aggressively tightening monetary policy. While supply chains and geopolitics are out of the Fed’s control, they cannot afford to let house prices rise unabatedly, in a repeat of 2006-07, nor can they let elevated inflation expectations become engrained (see Figure 8). Hence, they are forced to continue down a hawkish path. Figure 8: The food and energy shock has created awful optics between policy rate settings relative to prices Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, data as of March 31, 2022, and Bloomberg, data as of April 28, 2022 While we have probably already seen most of the repricing in the Treasury market, particularly further out the curve, it is hard to bet on interest rates moving materially lower. The path of forward Fed rate hikes is fairly certain over the next few quarters and is well-priced by markets. In contrast, the path forward for both global and domestic central bank liquidity is highly uncertain, and the tail risks for markets are more significant than the broad economy. If liquidity is suddenly contracted proactively (central banks reduce the size of their balance sheets by effectively net selling Treasuries), it removes critical support for the financial economy. Importantly, this process is not linear but is digital, such that credit markets can quickly lurch from “smoothly functioning” to “shuttered.” It is possible that the disruption of smoothly functioning financial markets leads the Fed to stop tightening well before inflation decelerates to its 2% target, which would implicitly signal that the Fed is comfortable with a slightly higher inflation target. Indeed, a broader view of financial conditions today suggests that they are closer to longer term averages than the policy rate alone would suggest (see Figure 9). Credit spreads, the U.S. dollar and an equity repricing have combined to tighten financial conditions by the most since 2018, at an annual pace seen only three other times in the last decade. While it may be necessary to tighten financial conditions even further as a late play to arrest runaway inflation, prolonged tightness in excess of prior peaks could be onerous enough to cause a capital market shutdown. Figure 9: The rapid tightening in financial conditions is more broad-based than the policy rate alone Source: Goldman Sachs, data as of April 25, 2022 Asset allocation in a hurricane During a financial hurricane, an investor’s goal of capital appreciation may need to take a back seat to the goal of capital preservation. An overweight cash allocation can go a long way toward preserving capital, and allowing for future buying opportunities at better prices, a theme that has certainly played out over the last year in fixed income markets. However, we are now getting to a point where deploying some of that cash makes sense, especially in high quality fixed income (Figure 10). Figure 10: The front end has been a safe haven, while the index is having its worst drawdown since the 1970s Source: Bloomberg, data as of April 26, 2022 Some parts of credit markets do also look interesting from a historical perspective, but this is mostly in the investment grade space, and largely due to the simultaneous widening in rates and spreads, pushing yields to their 99th percentile over the period of the last decade. In the lower quality parts of fixed income (high yield), spreads at their 40th percentile haven’t widened sufficiently to compensate investors for the risk of this financial hurricane being worse than expected. This pattern of higher quality assets having better forward return profiles is true in securitized markets as well – high quality CMBS, CLO and ABS spreads have widened more than their low-quality counterparts would suggest. At the bottom of the capital stack, in equities, robust fundamentals and earnings that should benefit from a high nominal GDP environment are in a tug-of-war with valuations that are now at the low end of their range of over the last two decades. On a relative basis, the repricing in credit markets has rendered once attractive free-cash-flow yields in equities as “just okay” today (not because cash flows per se are in question, but due to the dramatically rising discount rate against which future cash flows are measured, see Figure 11). Figure 11: Free-cash-flow yields are the least attractive relative to credit than any time since 2009 Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 31, 2022 During a hurricane of global liquidity contraction, the accompanying volatility can provide for excellent entry points in equities, especially in sectors with stable cash flows that are being liquidated by those in need of cash (see Figure 12). In just the last few weeks, these technical conditions may have resulted in certain equities already undershooting “fair value.” Figure 12: Lower liquidity leads to higher volatility (usually to the downside…) Sources: Bloomberg and Federal Reserve, data as of March 31, 2022 Further, as the hurricane passes through and is on the verge of ending, it is usually the best time to sell insurance. The price of insurance tends to be influenced by recency bias, and often overshoots the fair value of what it should cost to insure a portfolio from losses in tail-risk outcomes. The price of insurance has indeed risen rapidly in recent months: it costs 60% more to buy insurance against the S&P 500 declining 10% than it is to insure against a move higher by 10%, and the option market on some of the largest companies in the world is implying that they move by 40% over the next year – a gain or loss of a whopping $1 trillion in market cap in Apple, for example. In fixed income, the option market is suggesting a 68% chance of a 1.5% move in the 2-year swap rate – a huge range of 2% to 5% given its 3.5% starting point. All things considered, insurance premiums may be one of the most attractive sources of income today (while still allowing one to hold cash), but an investor must make sure to sell insurance only on assets that one would be happy to own at lower prices. Eventually, this financial hurricane too shall pass. During the last two hiking cycles, returns from the second hike to the equivalent policy rate that is being priced by year-end 2022 were accompanied by uniformly positive returns (see Figure 13). The current cycle has more crosscurrents, but we cannot rule out the potential for a rebound in financial assets given the amount of price adjustment that we have just witnessed in the first several months of 2022. So, we think investors would be well advised to find a safe place for this hurricane to pass, but do not stay in that place forever, because when we have enough visibility to know that the hurricane is indeed moving on, some spectacular returns could follow in its wake.

       "  'content': ' For some time now, co-investing covers one of the fastest growing strategies within private market investing. Co-investments, typically alongside private equity managers, offer sophisticated institutional investors and high net-worth individuals the opportunity to gain faster and greater exposure to attractive assets but at better terms — thus providing the potential to achieve more attractive returns. Additionally, and especially when investing in a well-diversified portfolio of co-investments, investors are more diversified across deals and sponsors, thereby decreasing the overall risk and potentially improving risk-adjusted returns even further. Investors or limited partners (LPs) are increasingly enticed by co-investments’ potential for higher expected returns, which is largely a function of lower fees. Providers not only charge lower management and performance fees but also offer risk management benefits, such as additional due diligence, active portfolio construction and a broader diversification across assets. In a syndication process, a general partner (GP) has already closed or is in the process of closing an investment prior to offering co-invest. Syndication processes are typically expedited since the GP has already negotiated the final terms of the transaction. Syndicated co-investments may be available to small investors who can react quickly. The information received in terms of due diligence materials are standardized with limited ability by the LP to shape diligence or the transaction terms. Typically, a GP may approach a sophisticated LP to go after an asset together where deal dynamics are uncertain and the asset may not be won. The LP needs to have a team with direct transaction experience who can sign equity commitment letters in pre-bid situations. The GP looks for an LP who is respectful of timelines, has an experienced team with deep domain expertise. LP has much stronger influence on the transaction structure, pricing and terms, as well as deeper insights into the transaction. Probability distributions of net multiples The figures shown relate to past performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. Source: BlackRock as of 30 June 2021. For additional details on the simulation please refer to the appendix. Visually, the above graphic shows that the left tail of the probability distributions is truncated dramatically when moving from primary funds to synthetic and to actual co-investment funds while offering more upside in the right tail. This clearly speaks for very strong risk-adjusted returns and explains in part the success and growth of co-investments. This work lays out the growth and evolution of the private equity co-investment market in addition to providing an empirical analysis of simulated co-investment funds compared to traditional primary funds across various market cycles. In a search for alpha, institutional investors have increased allocations to private equity in order to meet return targets. In this quest for alpha, investors have increasingly turned to co-investments to better control portfolio construction in addition to obtaining access to attractive investments at an improved fee basis. This paper finds the market still has room to grow given the advantages to both the GP and the LP taking into consideration the performance impact of the private equity premium, fee savings and selection of investments.

       "  'content': \" As a result of the growth of private markets, there is an increasing need to take a more holistic and analytical approach in building private market portfolios, benefitting from the various investment types available and differentiating between more alpha oriented strategies in private markets. For most institutional investors, primary fund commitments form the fundamental component of a well-planned, scalable and diversified private equity program. Opportunistic strategies such as secondaries and co-investments are derived from primaries and now provide a more nuanced approach to construct a private equity program. We focus on these investment types within the private equity market, although we will also touch on the blurring of lines between private equity and other asset classes, as well as overlaps between these investment types. We highlight the benefits of both secondaries and co-investments in a broader private equity portfolio and perform quantitative analyses to examine how these investment types impact performance, pacing, J-curve mitigation and risk-reward characteristics.

       "  'content': ' Much has been made about how inflation—after being in a slumber for more than a decade—has come roaring back. Consumers have seen the prices of things like gasoline, produce, furniture and used cars spike higher, which erodes the value of wages and crimped spending power on a day-to-day basis. Conversations globally have attributed the sudden resurgence of inflation on everything from a green-energy transition to pent-up demand and supply-chain issues. A deeper structural issue that can’t be ignored is an aging global population. The world is getting older. According to 2020 United Nations data, the number of people aged 65 and older is projected to more than double between 2020 and 2050 and reach over 1.5 billion by 2050. That compares with about 727 million in 2020. The fastest growing demographic is actually those in their 80s and older.1 The world is getting older United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Data retrieved in February 2022. Such a seismic demographic shift could bring about profound macroeconomic and investment implications. From a macroeconomic perspective, the significance of an aging society for inflation is visible mainly through two channels. Such trends will likely be associated with a drop in the labour force globally. This development would be the opposite from what we have seen in the last 30-40 years. In their 2020 book, The Great Demographic Reversal, Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan describe a “demographic sweet spot” as one in which the labour force is growing. But on the flipside, the reality of an aging population means the available pool of labour in advanced economies may be declining. A reduction in the share of workers can lead to labour shortages, which may raise the bargaining power of employees and lift wages—all of which is ultimately inflationary. An aging population could further shrink the labor force The World Bank, International Labour Organization. Data as of 21 March 2022. While this has been largely known and observed by economists and demographers for some time, the more striking development in recent years has been that a similar pattern is emerging in some developing economies like China, with signs of worker populations there also shrinking. This is critical because it implies advanced economies may start to struggle to “import” labour from such places either via migration or sourcing goods. The second significant effect of an aging society is a higher percentage of the workforce may be needed in the care sector. This happens to be a sector that is less likely to see efficiency improvements and the disinflationary effects from technology. Basically, it is easier to build an algorithm to automate clerical work than to build a robot than can take care of a human being. Our central scenario for the medium-term is that on average inflation will likely remain higher than in the years post-financial crisis due to structural forces, like the deglobalization trend meant to secure supply chains, the move toward sustainability, as well as this aging population phenomena. So with this more medium-term picture for inflation, it is key to ensure that investment portfolios are well positioned to reflect such a trend. BlackRock’s Multi-Asset Strategies & Solutions group has put our views into practice by maintaining a structurally long position in inflation-linked bonds globally. For portfolios that allow investment in private assets, we see potential in investing in infrastructure assets with a contractual revenue link to inflation. Commodities can also play a role as a hedge for inflation, although not all commodities are created equal. Our team’s proprietary research that was published last year and academic evidence indicate that energy has the strongest inflation-protection benefits, followed by industrial metals and finally agriculture and livestock. There was so much debate early last year over whether inflation will be “sticky” or merely “transitory”. But signs persist that inflation could be part of the economic backdrop for some time, for reasons including the demographic transition I just discussed. Ultimately, this will continue to shape how the investment community thinks about portfolio positioning and construction. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' With inflation at the highest level in decades and interest rates on the rise, equity investors are questioning their next moves. In fact, more than three in five Americans view inflation as the biggest risk facing the U.S. stock market over the next six months, according to a recent BlackRock Fundamental Equities survey of more than 1,000 individual investors.* U.S. Fundamental Equities CIO Tony DeSpirito offers timely perspective. What is the current state of inflation? The Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading of 7.9% as of February represents the highest headline inflation level since 1982. Core CPI, which excludes volatile components such as food and energy, registered at 6.4%. This comes after core inflation has lingered around 2% or below since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008. The COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing recovery have fueled the sharp uptick. An unprecedented and disruptive economic shutdown/reopen cycle has left the supply of goods low and consumer demand for them high as coincident fiscal and monetary stimulus helped to pad pocketbooks and set up a strong spending cycle. Intermittent factory closures around the world, which are continuing with the most recent outbreak of COVID in China, have upset global supply chains and exacerbated the imbalance. The war in Ukraine is only going to add to inflationary pressures. What is your outlook for inflation? We do not see inflation sustaining at the current decades-high level over the long-term, but we do expect it will settle into a range higher than the sub-2% seen in the post-GFC period. This is because some inflation, such as shelter and services inflation, is “sticky” ― meaning it will not work its way out as easily as other inflationary pressures where a rebalance of supply and demand will naturally create price stability. We could see inflation move toward its new long-run trend starting in the second half of this year. If we use the Atlanta Fed’s “Sticky CPI” gauge as the worst-case predictor, we estimate that could put inflation in the 3%-4% range. How have stocks historically fared amid rising inflation? We believe stocks are one of the best places to be in a rising inflation world. Our review of data back to the 1920s finds that equities perform well as long as inflation isn’t out of control ― over 10%, which is historically rare and not our expectation even in this unusual cycle. In above-average inflation environments (5%-10%), value stocks have performed particularly well. What allows value stocks to do better? If you think about investing time horizon, the expectation is that a value stock will return capital to shareholders faster than a growth stock. This is because, by definition, much of the expected cash flows from lower-multiple (value) stocks is front-end loaded. Conversely, growth stocks are considered longer-duration assets with expectations of greater cash flows further into the future. In essence, a higher proportion of the stock’s price comes from far-off cash flows, and that gets discounted by higher rates. This gives value stocks, with more stable near-term cash flows, an upper hand in an inflating environment. In an analysis of growth versus value using data since 1927, we found value has achieved greatest outperformance in periods of moderate to high inflation. It is only when inflation was very low that value performance paled. (See chart below.) A historically strong showing as inflation rises Value outperformance by inflation regime, 1927-2020 Source: BlackRock, with data from the Kenneth R. French Data Library and from Robert J. Shiller. Fama/French data uses the CRSP universe, which includes all companies incorporated in the U.S. and listed on the NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ exchanges. The level of annual inflation is defined as the year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). “Lowest inflation” represents the bottom 20 years of inflation readings; “highest inflation” represents the top 20 years; and “middling inflation” represents the remainder. The numbers below represent the range in inflation readings for each regime. Value outperformance is annualized and calculated across various inflation regimes using annual data from 1927 to 2020. Value outperformance represents the performance of value stocks minus growth stocks, as defined by the Fama/French HML research factor (i.e., “high valuation minus low valuation” using book to price). What does higher inflation mean for growth stocks? Low interest rates and tame inflation in the years after the GFC were a boon for longer-duration assets, including growth stocks. We’ve seen the drag on growth stock performance early this year as the market priced in the impact of higher rates to fight inflation. The flip side is that this dynamic does nothing to dilute the innovation that is powering many of these companies, particularly the proven business models with durable growth characteristics. In many cases, the sell-off was indiscriminate. This suggests many growth stocks, especially those unduly punished beyond what the fundamentals suggest, could present a good value for long-term investors. Which sectors have done well in inflationary times? We’ve done a lot of work around how different sectors and industries have performed in prior inflationary environments, particularly the last critical period centered around the 1970s. Sectors that performed the best included energy, healthcare and financials. Among those that performed the worst: consumer discretionary/staples, utilities and materials. While we don’t see high inflation persisting for the extended length of time that it did five decades ago, we see some sector-level patterns that could repeat (or rhyme), and others where it is less likely. Our findings are summarized in the table below. Source: BlackRock Fundamental Equities, with data from S&P and Russell indices, March 2022.

A stock-by-stock approach Companies generally have been able to manage higher costs, exhibiting pricing power and a willingness to invest in cost-saving measures to propel their businesses forward.

       "  'content': ' It’s quite easy to paint an apocalyptic picture for the global economy these days. If the war in Ukraine were to escalate, skyrocketing commodity inflation could ensue; and if China were to continue to pursue a Zero Covid policy amidst rising case counts, supply chains originating in Asia could get shut down again. Paying higher prices for dwindling quantities would send stagflationary alarm bells ringing through newspaper headlines, even more than they already are. Further, if U.S. consumption were to nonetheless stay strong, despite the cost-push inflation, buoyed by savings and pent-up demand, then the Federal Reserve (Fed) may be emboldened to tighten policy beyond neutral levels, or to withdraw liquidity at a pace that would hold real economic implications. And if the Fed were to aggressively do “whatever it takes” to kill off the recent spike higher in inflation, then a negative feedback loop could form with consumption slowing and financial markets deflating (with recession fears replacing stagflation fears). Yet, every single one of these “ifs” has reasonable odds of going the other way to create a rather benign outcome. If some sort of resolution were to be found in Ukraine, and if China were to pursue an optimization policy oriented around economic stability, then supply-driven, cost-push, inflation could be tamed more naturally. If U.S. consumption were to go from great to merely good, in sympathy with the higher prices already in the system, the Fed could take policy to neutral judiciously, as opposed to quickly, with the luxury of time to then decide whether to go further or not, depending on how economic conditions unfold. The outcome of all this? Inflation expectations would be contained, and a positive feedback loop could form with a resumption of rising real growth, resulting in financial asset prices that would respond to real economy cues (stocks and bonds would complement each other in portfolios, as they historically have, rather than compound losses). Each permutation and combination of these “if/thens” (both ugly and benign) seems to have exerted its own gravitational pull on markets at some point this year, sometimes simultaneously, creating a great deal of uncertainty and a multi-directional backdrop for investing as dizzying and complex as an M.C. Escher staircase (see Figure 1). We think that the outcomes of the “ifs” in question are so extreme and far-reaching that perhaps an investor’s goal of capital appreciation should, for now, be balanced with that of capital preservation, until a few more data points provide some much-needed clarity on the trajectory of the global economy. Figure 1: Relativity, by M.C. Escher Indeed, it would have been very difficult to predict the unprecedented drawdown in fixed income indices, the quick entry and equally speedy exit of the Nasdaq into and out of a bear market, or that commodities, like oil and gold, would be the only major assets in the green through the first quarter of 2022. Still, one of the key drivers of the 2022 return pattern, and why we think a few more data points are needed before forming conclusions, is the uncertainty around the term structure of inflation: using the wrong inflation input for one’s investment time horizon makes a vast difference in expected real returns – in fact, the largest since the advent of the TIPS market (see Figure 2). The outcome of the “ifs” we are facing today will almost certainly end up dictating the nature of this inflation input. Figure 2: Implied real returns on most fixed income assets flip signs depending on the time horizon Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 25, 2022 The Russia-Ukraine War “If” Representing about 12% of both global calories traded and global energy supply, Russia and Ukraine have a significant combined influence on consumer price indices from New Jersey to New Delhi (see Figure 3). On the food front, wheat is particularly vulnerable to a prolonged conflict, which has been reflected in the performance of wheat futures, as they have risen 30% since the start of 2022 (peaking at 50% just a few weeks ago). Figure 3: Russia and Ukraine are large contributors to the global supply of crops and fertilizers Sources: Comtrade and International Food Policy Research Institute, data as of February 24, 2022 As for energy, there was already a substantial “if” around how high prices could go without destroying demand. While oil prices in developed markets are causing consternation, prices in some large emerging markets have reached nosebleed levels in recent weeks (see Figure 4). The unwillingness of companies to spend on capital expenditures (capex), having been scarred by prior episodes of overinvestment, is compounded now by uncertainty around the future of Russian supply, and may keep prices high enough, for long enough, so as to accelerate a longer-term transition to alternative sources of energy. Figure 4: The cure for high prices may be high prices Sources: Bloomberg and ICE, data as of March 18, 2022 The cost-push inflation “If” So, already sticky-high global inflation has been shocked higher, while persistent supply chain bottlenecks and de-globalization are threatening to become stark economic realities. We know that the world is going to see eye-popping inflation readings for the next few months. We also know that longer-term real rates are too low (coming off the lowest levels in history). However, if this near-term inflation shock were to last for a longer period of time than the market is expecting, then long-term nominal rates would have to rise significantly so as not to appear grossly mispriced (see Figure 5). Figure 5: Long-term nominal rates imply deeply negative real returns against short-term inflation Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 28, 2022 The stagflation “If” While food and fuel prices have reached staggering heights amidst geopolitical tensions, they are unlikely to impact the U.S. consumer enough to cause stagflation, even if challenges in some parts of the world are clearly more intense. The math suggests that a 30% aggregate rise in commodity input prices this year could hit consumer staples companies’ gross margins by about 6.4% - a material hit, to be sure, but not nearly a death blow. Should those companies pass on the entirety of that 6.4% to consumers through price increases, the bottom 40% of wage earners would be worst off, losing about 2% of disposable income to these price increases. That could translate into a loss of 0.7% of GDP for the U.S. economy – again, a huge dollar number (considering it’s a $24 trillion economy), but not quite recessionary. In fact, previous wartime and post-war dislocations look similar to the inflationary episode we are facing today (see Figure 6). Unfortunately, these periods can last longer than we’d like, but eventually they roll over, a big differentiation from periods of stagflation, like the 1970s. Figure 6: Wartime price shocks can initially threaten stagflation, but then roll over Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, data as of December 31, 1953 (originally), March 31, 2022 The consumption “If” If price gains in more modest-ticket necessities, like food, aren’t enough to derail the U.S. economy, what about the biggest-ticket necessities, like houses? With significantly higher house prices being met by rising mortgage rates, the concern of less affordable housing is real. Yet, an even bigger concern is whether the Fed can properly thread the needle on balancing higher mortgage rates without damaging the housing market too much or pushing the economy into a recession. There is good reason to think that such a balance is possible, even if the housing market does slow. While a housing slowdown will invite comparisons to the mid- 2000s, today’s market is the opposite of 2006: there is no available supply of homes, especially at reasonable prices (restricting forward demand), amidst the tightest labor market since at least 1970 (meaning reasonably priced homes that do come to market are likely to be snapped up, as displayed in Figure 7). Figure 7: Fewer homes and many jobs today vs. many homes and fewer jobs in 2006 Sources: Mortgage Bankers Association (LHS), data as of March 18, 2022, and Bloomberg (RHS), data as of February 28, 2022 While there are clearly dents in the armor of this post-pandemic economic resurgence, inevitably leading to some degree of economic slowdown, the starting point and backbone of this economy are quite historically prolific, rendering stagflation, recession, or the demise of the U.S. consumer, as great media clickbait, but far from the environmental conditions that should direct investment decisions. Follow Rick Rieder on Twitter The Fed “If” There is also a wide policy angle of attack in balancing higher levels of inflation and lower levels of growth. One of the Fed’s tools is moral suasion. Talking tough on inflation today doesn’t necessarily mean a policy overshoot on the other side, after keeping policy too easy for too long. Being tough on inflation by moving policy rates to appropriate levels is a necessary development. Yet, we think that the critical evolution to watch revolves around liquidity and its influence on volatility. While there is some truly excessive liquidity in the system at present, if too much is removed, too rapidly, it could create a systemic shock by deflating the prices of goods, services and financial assets, as quickly as it inflated them (see Figure 8). Figure 8: 42% of all U.S. M2 liquidity was created in the last 24 months Source: Bloomberg, data as of January 31, 2022 The Europe “If” Despite the grim situation in Ukraine and short-term headwinds in the rest of Europe, there is a case to be made for European assets to do well in the long term, if fiscal and monetary policy can work together virtuously to create an attractive environment for productive investment (particularly, in areas such as energy and defense). While near-term uncertainty and concern over the European economy could very well continue to pressure the euro, monetary policy that is targeted at inflation and fiscal policy supporting energy, climate and immigration (among others) could very well ultimately buoy the currency and attract tangible investment into the region over the intermediate-to-long-term (see Figure 9). Figure 9: Despite the undesirable mix, NGDP in Europe has been rising; still above-average real GDP Source: Bloomberg, data as of December 31, 2021 The economic “If/Thens” lead to a series of investing “If/Thens” Nobody has seen the losses we’ve just been through in many high-quality fixed income indices because these losses have not occurred since the inception of said indices (see Figure 10). The return-carnage in high quality assets this year is a result of a combination of very low yields over the last two years, and the amount of debt issued at those yields, giving fixed income a historically small cushion, alongside tightening monetary policy amidst the historically large shocks that we are experiencing today. A further anticipated tightening by the market, and/or unexpected withdrawal of liquidity by central banks will potentially make these drawdowns even worse. Figure 10: Largest drawdown in the history of the U.S. Treasury Agg Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 25, 2022 Although the near-term trend in investment flows can be negative, and the “if’s” are still very significant, one must consider the underlying supply/demand dynamics for financial assets today (see Figure 11): the need for financial assets (returns) exceeds financial liabilities (payout obligations). And with net worth growth slowing, but still quite high, the need/desire to earn a return on that net worth continues to be historically high. Figure 11: Global liquidity as a share of the Global Aggregate Index Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 24, 2022 We like accumulating assets that are offering a historically attractive return profile, such as the front-end of the high-quality fixed income market, the front-end and belly of credit markets (both Investment Grade and High Yield), municipal bonds, and even parts of emerging market hard currency debt that have taken a beating. These assets are near the cheapest they have been in a decade, and in the case of U.S. corporate credit, could even be considered cheap relative to equities (see Figure 12). Figure 12: U.S. credit screens as attractive relative to equities, a rare phenomenon Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 28, 2022 Note: The IG/HY Free Cash Flow Model takes the Free Cash Flow per share of the S&P 500 and divides it by the blended HY and IG yield to get an intrinsic value for the S&P 500 Yet, fixed income could get cheaper still in an environment fraught with “ifs” and has recently failed to offer diversification benefits against equities, a correlation regime that continues to warrant a cash allocation in portfolios. While there will be incessant chatter about the flattening of the yield curve, implying an underperforming front-end and inviting talk of a recession, it is duration risk that matters most for investors. Front-end yields that optically underperform today do not necessarily translate into underperforming returns tomorrow: in fact, 1-to-3-year bonds have a forward return profile that crushes that of longer duration bonds (see Figure 13). Figure 13: Today, 1- to 3-year bonds have a more reliable income profile than 10-year bonds Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 25, 2022 Hence, investing in today’s markets feels a bit like being a security guard – there is a lot of watching of unprecedented environmental shocks, some of which occur after a long period of waiting for new information. But when periodic disturbances in markets do occur, action becomes necessary. Just as a security guard gets paid to wait, watch and then act, when necessary, today we like owning high-quality, short-duration assets that allow us to capture above-average yields, after the worst drawdowns in decades, while “watching and waiting to act,” with the knowledge that a few more months of data could bring a lot more clarity on which “ifs” transpire into which “thens.” '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Heightened geopolitical and inflationary pressures this year have put a spotlight on commodities, with investors using the asset class for a dual purpose: a potential hedge against inflation and adding diversification to a broader portfolio in a rising rate environment. As a result, we’ve seen an increase in prices and volatility across the commodity asset class as a whole. Commodities and inflationary forces Commodities, as represented by the S&P GSCI — a benchmark of 24 commodities in agriculture, energy and metals — is one of the top-performing asset classes year to date, up 34.52% through March 22nd, outpacing all other asset classes1. Structural drivers - such as strong demand from economies reopening from COVID-19 restrictions, localization of supply chains, and historical under-investment in commodity production — mean that the supply and demand mismatch could persist. Meanwhile, heightened geopolitical risk may be supportive of continued commodity strength. The current disruption in energy and commodity supplies could impact the inflation outlook significantly. 40% of Europe’s natural gas is sourced from Russia; the country is also responsible for 43% of global palladium, while Russia and Ukraine combined account for nearly 30% of global wheat exports.2 We see specific themes in commodities that could benefit from the transition to a low carbon economy. For example, we see persistent demand due to the vital role commodities play in renewable technologies, specifically metals such as copper, nickel, and aluminum. Copper, in particular, will be key to the low carbon transition. The metal is highly conductive and malleable. On average, a battery electric vehicle uses 183 lbs. of copper versus only 18-49 lbs. required by an average internal combustion vehicle.3 We believe exposure to commodities could help hedge against inflation. Notably, commodities like crude oil and natural gas are components within the energy portion of the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation. Not only does energy make up 7.4% of this inflation gauge, but it also impacts the costs many businesses bear in producing goods and services in the economy. 2022 commodities performance vs. S&P 500 & Bloomberg U.S. bond aggregate index Source: Bloomberg, as of March 22, 2022.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. Commodities as portfolio diversifiers On average, since 1997, commodities have historically outperformed the S&P 500 in the first 12 months after the beginning of a rate hiking cycle.5 They have exhibited relatively low correlation to equities and bonds over time, adding diversification to multi-asset portfolios6. Moreover, commodity sectors typically have a low correlation to each other. For instance, precious metals and livestock are two commodities sectors that have been negatively correlated in the last 10 years7. Therefore, broad commodity exposures could provide a source of diversification against equity and bond volatility within a rising environment. We are seeing sentiment towards gold strengthening as geopolitical uncertainty continues. Gold’s low-to-negative correlation to equities has been sought as equity volatility has increased in recent weeks.8 We believe the precious metal could benefit in the case of a negative growth shock — an economic shock that decreases potential GDP caused by the rising commodity prices. A negative growth shock could slow central bank appetite for rate hikes, decreasing the opportunity cost of holding gold in portfolios. ETFs for access to commodity indexes Investors are increasingly using commodities in their portfolios for diversification of returns and to help mitigate other risks in their portfolios, like inflation. Demand for broad, diversified commodities ETFs that give investors access to commodity exposures across the energy, metals, agriculture, and livestock sectors has continued to increase in 2022, bringing in $6 billion YTD after $8.4 billion in 20219. Gold focused ETFs also saw more than $9 billion of inflows as investors seek portfolio resilience. 2022 cumulative commodities flow Source: BlackRock, Bloomberg, as of March 22, 2022.

       "  'content': ' Key themes for investors The Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (IIJA), passed on November 2021, should result in greater infrastructure investment from private capital in the United States. The Act totals USD $1 tr over the next decade, including USD $550 bn of new spending on top of USD $450 bn that renews existing transportation funding. The funds will be distributed through grants and loans from federal agencies including the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy, as well as in the form of tax credits and other financial incentives. Key takeaways include some of the following: Net positive for investors: A primary goal of the Act was to leverage the effect of Federal programs with private capital, according to Sen. Rob Portman. The Act provides funding for projects that can drive economic growth as well as prepare the U.S. economy for the transition to net-zero, but with the aim of tapping both private equity and private debt. In addition, the legislation made it easier to greenlight projects, thus accelerating the permitting process. Public investment where it is needed: Many of the programs listed in the Act cover assets that are hard for private investors to underwrite due to a combination of high risk and low return. While transportation was the headline, there will be more money flowing to the Department of Energy (DOE). This investment provides important groundwork that can enable future private investment. Potential for new equity investments: The Act unlocks surface transportation (e.g. rail, road, etc.) for new concessions that allow private investors to come in as operators. It also encourages the use of public-private partnerships (PPP), which could lead to even more assets coming to market. 3D’s: The Act aligns with our investment themes: Decarbonization, Digitalization, & Decentralization. Components of new spending from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (category, $ billion USD spending) Source: Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act. August, 2021. Much needed funding for critical projects that encourage growth We believe many of the projects included in the Act should lead to stronger economic growth and open the door for greater private investment in certain infrastructure sectors in the future. These range from cyber-security measures, to electric grid modernization and the development and deployment of new technology such as carbon capture and hydrogen. Private capital currently invests in these on the fringes, but we believe greater public funding and development will make these sectors more investable in the future. Carbon capture, for example, could be a massive opportunity for infrastructure investors but the technology needs improvement to be economical. As the economy moves to net-zero, demands from customers and regulators will force businesses to greatly reduce their emissions. For many industries, carbon capture could be one of the best ways of accomplishing this. Hydrogen fuel is another example of an infrastructure technology that could be in high demand in the future, with the ultimate goal of having hydrogen hubs around the country. Utilities are quickly moving generation to renewable sources, but the two most prominent types of clean energy, solar and wind, are intermittent and peak generation does not always match peak demand. Natural gas ‘peaker’ generators, which utilities use during peak demand times, are one way to fill in the gap, and grid-level batteries can help. However, utilities believe that hydrogen could be the key to mass deployment of renewable energy on the grid scale, but costs need to improve.1 Private companies are investing in hydrogen as a fuel, but government support can hasten the move from the fringe to a more serious component of the US energy stack. Carbon sequestration is essential in the road to net zero by 2050 Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research; as of June 23, 2021. The renewable energy sector did not get as much direct assistance as originally expected, but the sector should benefit from supporting infrastructure. Renewable tax credits, which were included in the first version of the plan released in April were ultimately removed. However, the Act does include plans to increase grid resilience, reduce red tape on approval of transmission and provide necessary infrastructure around storage, including end-of-life recycling of grid-level batteries. Funding for ports should alleviate some supply-chain bottlenecks that is contributing to higher inflation today. The Act also puts aside $7.5bn for electric vehicle charging through grant programs and funding through the States which has been distributed. The focus on EV charging networks in the Act has resulted in more interest by municipalities, utilities and EV charging companies. Real estate should see ancillary benefits While real estate is not explicitly included in the plan, the sector inherently needs strong infrastructure to be useful for tenants. Improvements to roads and bridges are generally positive for all types of real estate. New public and, potentially, private capital supporting intermodal facilities should reduce friction for logistics tenants such as retailers and 3PL companies. Urban apartments and offices should benefit from improved public transit and congestion relief measures. Investment in broadband infrastructure would also help the growth of more tertiary metro areas as this may have previously been a barrier for population inflows. Further, programs around drought response included in the Infra Act will likely be necessary and especially supportive of real estate in the western region. Programs related to flood mitigation and FEMA response should support eastern and southern parts of the United States. The Infra Act could lead to more assets The Act should expand the availability of debt assets by broadening what qualifies as tax-exempt collateral and increasing existing caps. Qualifying broadband and carbon capture facilities are now eligible for tax-exempt status. This should bring more bonds to market backed by these types of assets. Additionally, the Act increases the national cap for tax-exempt highway bonds from USD $15 bn to USD $30 bn. Currently, USD $14.9 bn of the cap is used, according to the Bond Dealers of America, so further expansion will unlock a crucial funding source for state and local governments on their infrastructure. This spending may cause ancillary projects to be funded, which could need additional taxable bonds, although it is likely too early to speculate the potential supply. U.S. Infrastructure debt issuance in 2015 vs. 2021 Source: Inframation, infrastructure debt issuance in 2015 and 2021 The Infra Act creates a path for new equity opportunities. Within the law there is an entire section dedicated to new asset concessions for ‘surface transportation,’ which would give private investors the right to own and operate these assets. Surface transport includes highways, rail and intermodal facilities. It does prevent concession holders from taxing or tolling taxpayers earning less than USD $400k, so investors will likely focus on assets geared more towards businesses, such as intermodal terminals rather than toll roads. Language regarding public-private partnerships (PPP) is also sprinkled throughout the rest of the Infra Act, covering other types of infrastructure. In general, this will contribute to more public-private partnerships in the near term, but it may also be a harbinger of greater use of PPPs in the future within the US. Public-private partnerships with the Federal government have been especially difficult to implement due to red tape, and the law has provisions to lessen this hurdle. There are also many new loan and grant programs available for private investors. For example, the Act authorizes the Department of Energy to extend grants to transmission and generation owners and operators for improving resiliency. Another provides matching funds to implement ‘smart grid’ features. One sign of the potential growth of PPPs is that the Act requires value-for-money analysis on certain highway and railroad projects totaling over USD $750mm. This would require the project sponsor to price out a PPP option before moving ahead with only public funding. While this does not directly increase PPP usage, it opens the door for more growth over the next few years. Download full report '},\n",

       "  'content': ' The U.S. Federal Reserve’s (“Fed”) pivot away from the view that inflation is “transitory” signaled the beginning of the end for the ultra-low rate environment we have come to think of as normal. Financial markets reacted to this new information by aggressively repricing shorter-term interest rates to start the year. The exit from these policies now appear well priced-in for the U.S. as yield curves have flattened to levels typically associated with the end of a tightening cycle. Investors are now debating the terminal rate and what happens if inflation does not fall as much as consensus and the Fed expects. It looks almost certain that the Fed must end the era of quantitative easing (“QE”). Was QE a success? We must wait for quantitative tightening (“QT”) to see. The ultimate judge of more than a decade long experiment in unconventional policies lies in how the Fed can balance its conflicting objectives of maximum employment and stable prices without fully knowing how financial conditions will respond. Past inflationary cycles rarely end well for financial markets. The Russian invasion induced spike in commodity prices holds the potential to further exacerbate what might already be in train: a wage-price spiral. The risks surrounding this scenario have clearly increased and a more cautious outlook for this downside possibility is increasingly warranted. A stagflationary shock The economic and financial impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine represents a stagflationary shock for the global economy. The prices of commodities, including fuel, food and metals are all surging. Stagflation, an economic environment of stagnant growth and rising inflation, was once a long-tail risk, but now appears to be a real possibility. Figure 1 highlights crude oil and European natural gas prices have spiked to multi-year highs in a matter of days. As the Russian-Ukraine conflict continues, higher energy and commodity prices may feed through to broader increases in inflation and—combined with negative sentiment and confidence—a decline in global growth. So far, estimates for those impacts remain modest but hinge critically on the severity of the energy price spike, its duration, and the potential secondary effects. Figure 1: Russian invasion is creating shocks in energy marketsBrent crude oil and European natural gas futures prices Source: Bloomberg, as of 3/8/22. Markets typically price geopolitical risks quickly. However, with no clear near-term off-ramp for the conflict, we may be at the beginning of a more permanent reordering of Russia’s role in the global economy and more uncertainty as the West counteracts these rising tensions. Such ramifications are still being assessed in financial markets particularly on the outlook for the policy response. For Europe, with a more direct hit to both inflation and growth, dramatic shifts in security and energy policy suggest an accommodative fiscal policy response while the European Central Bank (“ECB”) outlook has become more balanced between the inflationary (tighter) and growth (loosening) impacts. For the U.S., higher commodity prices may flow into a longer period of elevated inflation, further bringing into question the forecast for its rapid decline in the second half of 2022. That will keep pressure on the Fed to normalize its currently highly accommodative stance. Flight-to-quality assets, a popular safe haven during periods of rising geopolitical tensions, may be a less sure outcome given the backdrop of tightening monetary policy. Expect more shockwavesThe unprecedented level of sanctions imposed on Russia is tantamount to completely removing the country from the global economy. Government officials and Russian-owned companies have been targeted. Its banking sector has been removed from the SWIFT messaging system—essentially disconnecting it from the financial system. Its capital markets have been cut out of global indices. Foreign private companies have stopped selling products and services in Russia. Even yachts have been seized. The latest move by the U.S. to ban its imports of Russian oil sent oil prices even higher. Extending this ban into Europe particularly in the short run and for Russian gas may not initially be possible, given the current dependency of Europe on Russian gas. However, the realization of the vulnerability has sent European energy and security policy on a new course with significant longer-term consequences. The magnitude of the energy price shock and its length will be key to the economic consequences. Failing to see an easy off-ramp for the crisis, the disruptions to energy markets may prove longer than initially anticipated, raising the uncertainty in the fight to rein in inflation and likely extending its duration. The vaccination for inflation? Vaccines gave us great hope that they could ease the scourge of the health pandemic. Analogously, the market expects the central bank “vaccination” for inflation will do the same. Both the Fed and most economic forecasters expect inflation to steadily return to the pre-COVID levels of around 2%. For central banks, vaccinating against inflation means moving away from the pandemic-era policy prescription of massive liquidity support and persistent negative and zero policy rates. But like the unpredictable peaks and valleys of the virus’s case count curve, markets may face the realization that these inflation vaccines may not be entirely effective against the “variants” of inflation. If so, markets may need to learn to live with more “endemic” inflation rather than a swift to return to “normal” that markets have experienced for the past decade. Retiring “transitory”The start of 2022 has not been kind to the old “transitory” view of inflation. Alongside “still dancing” and “subprime is too small to matter”, Fed Chair Jerome Powell retired “transitory” to the ash heap of historic market quip fails. Now, he has pivoted the Fed to acknowledging a more balanced view of inflation and a need to shift policy to a much less accommodative stance. Incoming data has made this reaction appear even further behind the curve, with continuously elevated readings signaling pressures beyond the supply chain bottlenecks associated with COVID disruptions. This inflation situation is not just a U.S. dilemma. European inflation data has started to break higher, and the ECB seems ready to break its policy commitment to hold rates constant throughout 2022. As a result, global rate expectations have moved significantly higher since the start of the year (Figure 2). Figure 2: Market rapidly shifted to anticipate significant hikes in U.S. and U.K.Global government bond rate expectations by end of 2022 Source: Refinitiv Datastream and BlackRock Investment Institute, as of 3/4/22. Lines calculated by using 100 minus the futures Dec 2022 and Dec 2021 futures prices on 3m Euribor, 3m Sterling, 3m Eurodollar, and 3m euroyen contracts. These market moves stand in contrast to the still benign inflation view held by both central banks and most economic forecasters. Though market expectations stand above official central bank forecasts, both parties anticipate a reduction in inflation back towards long-run goals of 2%. Despite retiring the \"transitory\" label, Fed policy forecasts reflected a transitory view of inflation. However, as inflation continues to be high and with recent energy price shocks, policymakers have clearly highlighted that the risks to inflation are on the upside to these forecasts. The key is whether inflation can actually decline even with above average longer-run real GDP growth, below longer-run unemployment levels, and with negative real policy rates. If not, absent changes in the first two, the Fed will need to set real policy rates higher than zero to bring inflation down or hope the supply side improvements underlying the \"transitory\" view on inflation can alone account for a return to pre-COVID inflation levels. Risks assuming inflation is benignTo use our virus metaphor, one of the key signposts of inflation moving from a spreading “pandemic” to more of a constant “endemic” is firm and worker pricing power. Both companies and workers have discovered they have pricing power (Figure 3). Historically high levels of “quits rate” indicate workers are exercising pricing power through elevated job switching. Similarly, companies report for the first time a strong ability to pass on price increases. Add to that now a more prolonged inflationary environment from the commodity spike, and the risks grow that transitory inflationary becomes entrenched. Figure 3: Company pricing power and worker pricing power breaks out upwardsCompany pricing power and cost of workers Source: Evercore ISI Company Surveys, Bloomberg, BLS, as of 12/31/21. This combination might have already kicked off a wage-price spiral—where rising wages lead firms to pass on price increases and rising prices embolden workers to demand higher wages. The risk is a continuous cycle of inflationary pressures that is endemic and not necessarily benign. Both the benign and endemic inflation scenarios have merit. Looking at Figure 4, the expectations for the path of inflation (yellow line), will rely on the broad strength of its underlying components (red line) and whether the forecasted declines start to show up in late spring and early summer. Policymakers will need to shift their current strategy if their assumptions do not play out. Figure 4: The rise and (forecasted) fall of inflationU.S. Trimmed Mean PCE and Core PCE inflation rates Source: Bloomberg, as of 1/31/22. Gray area is projected through June 2023. Determining the dosageThe surprisingly strong inflation data and its belated recognition by global central banks still only shows up in markets as an expectation for a faster move towards normalization—not a materially higher level of rates. Where normalization ends up remains relatively unchanged. Market expectations in the U.S. now price in a 25 bp hike at each meeting beginning in March. In Europe, the market initially priced in 50 bps worth of hikes by the end of the year before unwinding those expectations in face of the Russian invasion. Figure 5 highlights in the U.S., that measured in 2 years forward, the difference between the yield on 2-year and 10-year maturity bonds is essentially zero. This is one example of how yield curves have already flattened to a level typically associated with a level expected at the end of the tightening cycle. Figure 5: Yield curve prices in a full tightening cycle before the first tightening has even startedFed Funds Rate and steepness of yield curve (2s10s) Source: Bloomberg, as of 3/4/22. At the end of 2021, the Fed\\'s terminal rate forecasts had projected long-term policy rates around 2.5%. Coupled with the median longer-run inflation forecast of 2.5% (on CPI equivalent basis) implies a terminal zero real Fed Funds rate. All those estimates are likely to change in future Statement of Economic Projection releases and the bias is towards higher inflation forecasts and a higher path of policy rates along the way. Whether the Fed projects that the terminal rate returns to pre-COVID levels will be a key determinant of longer maturity yields performance. However, looking back through historical tightening cycles one lesson becomes clear: Fed policy rates typically end up eventually at a level above inflation in order to bring that inflation back down. More persistent inflation in the longer-run may imply a need for either a higher terminal rate or a higher rate along the way to terminal that actually tightens policy in order to bring inflation back down to that 2% longer-run forecast. Was QE a success? That depends on QT 2022 may mark the end of the historic global central bank experiment we have come to call quantitative easing (“QE”). Undoubtedly, QE saved the world’s economies from certain disaster in 2008 and 2020, but knowing if it was a success will depend on the exit strategy: quantitative tightening (“QT”). Inflation and geopolitics make QT much more difficult for central banks. So far, the forecast looks good, but a more cautious outlook may be warranted when considering the sheer size and reach of QE programs. Markets have become accustomed to over a decade of massive central bank balance sheet expansions supporting an asset inflation program geared around principles of the “portfolio rebalance” channel. Think of portfolio rebalance as the result of central bank policies that influence investors to shift their investments away from safe-haven assets towards assets with higher expected returns. The effect of portfolio rebalance can be seen in capital markets and in real assets like housing. Recall that the Fed took a similar path to combat the Global Financial Crisis (“GFC”). Accommodative policies helped to stabilize and then ease financial conditions. The appeal of safe-haven assets declined, and the attractiveness of risky assets grew. This asset reflation helped restore the confidence needed to support a consumption-based economy. During COVID, portfolio rebalance was even more immediate and effective as it was coupled by enormous fiscal policy support including direct transfers. That helped to support a rapid recovery in wealth in assets and maintained consumer consumption power as seen in Figure 6 with the surge in savings rates and subsequent decline once the spending kicked in as the worst COVID fears were averted. During COVID, portfolio rebalance was even more immediate and effective as it was coupled by enormous fiscal policy support including direct transfers. That helped to support a rapid recovery in wealth in assets and maintained consumer consumption power.

The (de facto) third policy objectiveThe problem with the QE-era policy of relying on portfolio rebalance is that it moves financial conditions into a de facto third policy objective and constraint. Because the policy transmission function relies on financial conditions (i.e. stable interest rates and rising stock markets), those aspects become additional constraints to traditional policy objectives (inflation and employment). Policymakers can’t raise rates suddenly and dramatically to fight off inflation because it could cause a severe decline in valuations of risky assets like stocks. Investors understand this, and increasingly factor policy support into their investment decisions. The results have been mutually beneficial as the rise in measured wealth in the U.S. is beyond any historical comparisons. Growth in the U.S. today relies on consumption, and wealth effect fueled confidence can drive up or down that confidence. Using the portfolio rebalance channel post GFC in 2008 both recognized and codified this relationship. But in doing so, the Fed made normalizing highly accommodative policy through balance sheet reductions more difficult. The 2013 Taper Tantrum proved market expectations correct that when faced with too rapid of a tightening in financial conditions, the Fed would pull back on policy normalization. Normalizing now becomes much more challenging for the Fed due to inflation. In 2013, inflation was still low, limiting any perceived cost from slowing normalization. Today, the Fed needs to thread the needle even more carefully between tightening enough to look credible on fighting inflation without pushing financial markets into a panic, harming confidence, and risking a recession. Portfolio construction implications We see two scenarios where inflation significantly impacts asset allocation decisions. The first is a return to the “secular stagnation” of the 2010s when inflation and growth were consistent but low. The second scenario is one where we must learn to live with higher levels of uncertainty around both inflation and growth. A return to secular stagnationThe market expects inflation and growth to return to the pre-COVID level of 2% by 2024. This low growth, low inflation environment led primarily to persistent zero and negative real interest rate policies. Flat term premia for inflation risk in an environment of low and stable inflation imply similarly low real rates of interest on longer-maturity bonds. Low real yields imply low expected real returns from bonds. And low safe asset returns lead to the outward shift in risk taking in pursuit of higher returns—the portfolio rebalance effect. Analog to this, the equity market saw the persistent outperformance of growth stocks over value stocks in an era decidedly lacking in (nominal) growth opportunities. We are well acquainted with this market environment. Living with inflation and growth uncertaintyBut what about the alternative scenario where inflation fails to fall back to pre-COVID levels? For the Fed to just keep policy close to neutral, higher inflation implies higher terminal rates. A 3% inflation rate implies a policy rate of 3.25-3.50%—a full 100 bps higher than currently priced—just to get back to neutral. You might need to actually get policy tight to achieve stable inflation. That requires moving policy rates above the level of inflation. But even a small real positive interest rate at the short end might cascade across financial markets in ways that tighten financial conditions aggressively. Either that forces the Fed’s hand to ease back on tightening or makes the smaller amount of tightening that much more effective as it transmits through financial conditions. The portfolio rebalance effect could now go in the opposite direction with risk assets becoming less appealing and the perceived loss of wealth hurting confidence and spending. How much sensitivity to financial conditions has over a decade of unconventional QE policy sown? No one can be certain, but the impact of portfolio risk shifting in response to easing financial conditions has been slow and methodical over the decade. Behavioral finance highlights the reverse is unlikely to be similar. Loss aversion means a more rapid rebalance—which partially explains the “tantrum” like behavior we often see in financial markets. Markets grind upwards and gap downwards. Such risks are now much more likely given the Fed no longer has all three of its main policy objectives aligned. Taking the fight to inflation means risking both full employment and financial stability. Managing the side effects of an inflation vaccinationInvesting in this shifting environment requires recognizing the new risks. Investors should evaluate allocations relative to forecasted future risks and rely less on past results as a guide. For stock and bond allocations, it is imperative to question the health of historical negative correlations given the toll that inflation and rising rates can have on bond returns. Many investors are entering an environment they have little to zero experience navigating. That leads to the search for solutions between alternative asset classes and alternative investment strategies. In asset classes, the market has now moved to fully price in meeting-by-meeting hikes in 2022 (Figure 7), improving the risk reward to the short end of the yield curve. Longer-maturity assets retain their flight to quality benefits but may become more vulnerable as they approach the terminal rate if inflation fails to fall as much as forecast. Higher credit risk assets, such as high yield and emerging market debt, look less appealing given the higher yields available in risk-free rates. However, widening in credit spreads is helping by providing some more risk premia to a recessionary or stagflationary outlook. For the near-term, we find safer assets in Investment Grade and MBS more attractive given their higher exposure to risk-free rates and less credit spread exposure. Figure 7: Meeting-by-meeting hikes expectedInterest rate at YE 2022 and implied number of hikes Source: Bloomberg, as of 3/4/22. The Russian invasion coming on top of the already difficult inflationary outlook further raises the uncertainty for both risk-free and risky assets. In such an environment, it may be prudent to augment portfolio asset allocations, which are dominated by “beta” risk, with “alpha” return sources. New sources of diversification and return may be needed as inflation undermines the traditional diversifying properties of bonds. Download commentary '},\n",

       "  'content': ' A Q&A with Rick Rieder Q: What is your outlook for 2022 for your asset class? In our view, demand for fixed income will continue to exceed expectations, generally holding yields in check at higher levels than we have been used to over the past couple of years amid historically high inflation, but when the dust settles, we’ll see real rates that are still at historically low levels. That’s partly because corporate pension funds are sitting on the highest average funding status in almost two decades, prompting a reallocation out of risky assets and into risk-free securities, like long duration Treasury bonds. At the same time, nominal growth is also the highest it has been in decades, driven by an immense stock of liquidity, meaning risky spreads can stay well contained for longer since corporate default fears can be kept at bay due to rising earnings. We think the Bloomberg-Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, a hybrid of both risk-free and risky assets, should rightfully back up in 2022, in sympathy with strong growth, which we’ve already started to see early this year. So, it’s hard to see a promising return coming from this index in 2022. Still, with both risk-free yields and risky spreads staying relatively contained, due to other supporting factors, it’s also hard to see investors suffering a crippling loss in this broad index. So, we’re still optimistic about an astute investor’s ability to generate a positive return in fixed income, despite the Aggregate index likely not straying too far from flat, but it’s going to require a well-calibrated, and active, approach and the ability to engage market segments beyond those included in the index. Q: How will fiscal policy and focused spending in the U.S. (can acknowledge other countries as well) impact markets and drive growth, and what are some of the knock-on effects (i.e., inflation, tightening labor markets, debt levels, etc.)? As my colleague Bob Miller has recently argued, new fiscal policy support may no longer be likely, but in our view the probability of fiscal tightening in the next three years is near zero. That places the burden of refining policy on the Federal Reserve, and policy normalization in 2022 will be in the context of a second consecutive year of impressive nominal GDP growth (see graph below), making the composition of that growth, namely the quantities and prices components, of critical importance for investors. Expectations for nominal growth in 2022 are historically high Bloomberg, data as of December 8, 2021. The supply of labor will determine the evolution of the labor market, rather than demand. Conservatively, assuming 200k-400k monthly nonfarm payroll gains over the course of 2022, wage growth that is in-line with that of the last 12 months, and no change in hours worked, we would witness an aggregate income gain for the labor force of about 7% over the course of 2022. And remarkably, in that event aggregate income would have grown by more than 14% since the pandemic began in February 2020. Yet this also means that about three million people will need to be added to the labor force – an effective “passing of the income baton” from fiscal stimulus to wages, a process that is well underway. While the numbers are volatile, non-seasonally adjusted payroll data suggests that more than a half million employees are being added to payrolls each month in 2021, which would likely be even stronger absent supply constraints. While we are seeing early signs of moderation on supply-chain stresses, economic velocity is now gaining support from increased commercial and industrial lending, and consumer lending, which can keep upward pressure on prices for several more months. Our projection is for Core PCE inflation to ultimately migrate back to the 2.5% to 3.5% range by year-end, as commodity prices plateau near these elevated levels and as many of the logistical bottlenecks loosen up. However, we are preparing for more headline-grabbing inflation data points that could send the media, and some traders, into a tailspin. Moreover, there’s also clearly some inflation-stickiness from persistently higher wages and a corporate sector that is in the luxurious position of being able to raise prices almost at will. Q: How do you expect fiscal spend and monetary policy forecasts to impact your remit, both from a tactical & a long term perspective? Tactically, where is the market mispricing risk? Very important to 2022’s market path is how the Fed responds in the months ahead, especially in the face of these potentially uncomfortable inflation readings. The Fed’s policy response to the pandemic was heroic, and their ongoing accommodation has been instrumental in enabling the real economy to withstand waves of new Covid variants. But with real-economy confidence now sufficiently restored, the Fed needs to migrate monetary policy back toward neutral; before pausing to determine if more restrictive monetary policy is required. In our view, one of the market’s riskiest blind spots for this year will be navigating portfolio allocation changes as the Fed evolves its policy stance. Historically speaking, in terms of monetary policy, “tightening,” or “over-tightening,” was about corralling excessive credit growth (demand that was fueled by credit). However, today’s conditions are precisely the opposite: U.S. consumers have been paying down credit for a decade. There has been very little credit growth, much less excessive growth, largely due to an influx of cash via pandemic stimulus measures (indeed, there is about $2.5 trillion of excess savings on consumer balance sheets right now). From our perspective, the Fed’s policy toolkit should consist of rate hikes as well as some reduction in the central bank’s balance sheet. On rates, targeting the pre-Covid level of 1.50% as an initial destination seems prudent, with the mantra of ‘data dependence’ setting a high hurdle to adjust to either more accommodative, or restrictive, levels. We subscribe the economic theories that policy “works with long and variable lags,” and that inflation itself tends to be a lagging indicator. With that perspective, we support the Fed setting a course to an achievable resting place as a good first step on this policy journey. The velocity of money is set to bounce from historic, pandemic-induced lows The modern history of US M2 Velocity Bloomberg, data as of September 30, 2021. Stepping back from the policy path, we think the real economy has some tangible momentum behind it. Indeed, we think M2 velocity is set to bounce sharply from its lowest level in history (see graph above), buoyed by still strong sentiment in both the real and financial economies. In fact, the equation of exchange suggests that a small mean-reversion in velocity, in light of the recent large increase in the monetary base, can create gaudy nominal growth outcomes over time. The return of velocity may have already begun as October was the first post-Covid month without any new excess savings (but cumulative savings remain around $2.5 trillion), and after an anemic 18 months for consumer and real estate loan growth, a $1.6 trillion gap in bank lending has developed. Therefore, there is ample space for credit creation to pick up the growth baton once QE ends in 2022, in our view. In short, the Fed operates on top of the most dynamic, and self-correcting, economy in the history of the world. Cushioning the system is critical when a major shock occurs (e.g., a historic and unpredictable global pandemic), but otherwise, the Fed’s stated destination of price, market and economic stability is probably best reached by operating with policy stability, while allowing the vibrant, innovative and flexible U.S. economy to recalibrate organically. Q3: Which asset classes and sectors are best positioned to benefit from the investment in new technology and energy infrastructures underpinning the net-zero transition? While global growth will be robust, parts of the tech sector are set to grow exponentially over the next decade. Virtual reality, augmented reality, and the metaverse are going to be concepts that we hear more and more about, and in which early investors will likely be rewarded. Technology continues to permeate the healthcare industry too: medical investment is set to soar in a post-Covid world. Last but not least, as you asked about energy infrastructure in the context of the net-zero transition, this is going to be an important secular investment theme and we’re undoubtedly going to continue to get weather events to reinforce that theme. In our view, staying in front of these structural forces is imperative, but especially in the equity segment of the capital structure Ever evolving climate-focused policy initiatives will continue to play a very large role in dictating where investment dollars are allocated, with a significant feedback to how and where prices are set, and profits are earned. Q: What are your top positioning ideas heading into 2022? Given our view that the Aggregate index is likely to end the year in moderately negative territory, we think it’s important to be able to engage market segments beyond those included in the index, including those below investment grade. More specifically, some of the yields available in U.S. and European credit sectors are not terribly far from being able to reach that 3% to 5% target, especially if one is willing to dip into high yield segments. Further, emerging markets yields are even higher, but emerging markets positions need to be sized appropriately, given their volatility. And while Emerging Markets were best avoided last year (excluding China), the proactive increases in policy rates from EM central banks to fend off inflation have now created an attractive opportunity set of real rates to buy in 2022, albeit with patience and tactical entry points needed as noise from Fed tightening can cloud the vision here. And as markets have evolved over the past month, we now see more decent value in the short-to-belly segment of the U.S. Treasury market, where tightened policy is fairly priced, and yields offer some protection against downside for the first time since the onset of Covid. Of course, we must remain aware of the potential for an overly aggressive Fed to overshoot, which could press these yields still moderately higher. Additionally, the very back-end of the Treasury curve, while it can be a more volatile trading vehicle, nevertheless can provide a decent entry point today to defease liabilities for long-term managers. Bank loans can also perform well with a strong economy and modestly higher rates. And bespoke securitized assets in commercial real estate, consumer credit and CLOs should round out investors’ fixed income portfolios, with meaningful support from vibrant economic cash flows and an enormous pool of cash that needs attractive returns in a still low-yielding world. The liquidity injections of 2020-21 underpin a sticky high growth rate, or the “g” variable in the terminal value equation. As a result, organic growth in 2022 will be enough for equity markets to post a decent return for the fourth consecutive year, but as mentioned likely a lower return than the exceptional performance of the last few years. Still, too many market participants are solely focused on inflation, but if there’s a 1970s parallel that’s useful today, it’s how extreme policy actions can influence market returns for a long time (see graph below). In 1980, a high discount rate made the risk-free rate a superior investment for years afterward, and in 2022, the liquidity injections of the last two years will likely keep growth, and asset prices, high for several years hence.

       "  'content': ' Key themes: 1. Policy normalization and living with inflation Markets have started the new year on a jittery note, with worries centering on Fed rate increases and policy normalization. These moves are worth putting into context. Long-term rates remain at the low end of their historical ranges, with the real rate on the 10-year Treasury at roughly -0.75%. Second, although markets now expect rate increases to start sooner than they did a few months ago, the expected cumulative increase in rates over the next three years is essentially the same as it was before the Fed\\'s hawkish pivot. Such an increase would represent the most muted inflation response in decades. We see quantitative tightening (QT) – the shrinking of the Fed’s balance sheet - working mostly through the term premium, the extra compensation investors demand for the risk of holding government bonds. The 2018-19 experience suggests a small impact from QT alone. Yet in the context of rising inflation, QT could add to a broader narrative around the need for greater compensation from fixed income relative to risk assets. This new regime implies a more fundamental asset reallocation. The Fed might be contributing to this reallocation rather than causing it. The focus for monetary policy in 2022 is not on hitting the brakes but on taking the foot off the gas and returning to a more neutral policy stance. 2. Cutting through confusion There are no historical parallels to today’s confluence of events – the economic restart, the appearance of new virus strains, supply-driven inflation and the development of new central bank frameworks. As a result, the current environment is marked by confusion. Cutting through this confusion is key. To do so, it is essential to identify risks in the new regime. We see three main risks. The first risk is that a global resurgence in COVID-19 infections could delay the restart of economic activity. This problem could be particularly acute in China if its zero-COVID approach results in repeated shutdowns. The Omicron strain appears less severe than other variants in populations with high vaccination and immunity rates. Moreover, evidence from almost two years of the pandemic shows that successive waves of the virus have had less and less impact on GDP – a positive for the growth outlook. We expect new virus strains to delay, but not derail, the restart. The second risk is that central banks could revert to previous policy responses in the face of persistent inflation pressures. Finally, inflation expectations could diverge significantly from policy targets in the post-COVID confusion, forcing central banks to react aggressively. This development could lead to stagflation — high inflation becoming persistent amid stagnating activity. 3. Navigating net zero Climate change and the race for the world to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 also play into the general confusion. There is a popular notion that tackling climate change may lead to higher economic costs and inflation. We don’t agree. Yes, the outlook would be better if climate change didn’t exist. But that’s not an option; climate change is real. A smooth net-zero transition, therefore, has to imply higher growth and lower inflation than any alternative, in our view. No climate action or a disorderly transition suggests lower growth and higher inflation. The energy crunch in late 2021 revealed that the transition so far has been lopsided: Reduced investment in fossil fuels has not been offset by a boost to investment in alternative energy and its infrastructure. A smoother and more balanced transition will not only need clean energy but also new technologies to store and distribute it. In our view, demand for fixed income will continue to exceed expectations. One reason: Corporate pension funds, at their highest average funding status in almost two decades, are likely to reallocate out of risky assets and into risk-free securities. We expect strong demand to hold yields in check, albeit at higher levels than in recent years amid historically high inflation. When the dust settles, we expect real rates to remain historically low. Risk spreads also should stay contained as strong nominal growth keeps fear of corporate defaults at bay. We think yields in the Bloomberg-Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, a hybrid of risk-free and risky assets, should rise in 2022. But if both risk-free yields and risky spreads stay relatively contained, as we expect, this broad index looks unlikely to deal investors crippling losses. Moreover, we’re optimistic about astute active investors’ ability to generate a positive return in fixed income. U.S. fiscal spending and central bank policy outlook Although new fiscal policy support may no longer be likely, in our view the risk of fiscal tightening in the next three years is near zero. The policy burden will be on the Federal Reserve. The Fed is likely to normalize monetary policy in 2022 only in the event of a second consecutive year of impressive nominal GDP growth (see table below). For investors, how much of that growth comes from price increases versus real growth will be critical. In our view, one of the greatest challenges this year will be navigating changes to portfolio allocations as the Fed evolves its policy stance. Expectations for nominal growth in 2022 are historically high Source: Blooomberg, data as of December 8, 2021. Although new fiscal policy support may no longer be likely, in our view the risk of fiscal tightening in the next three years is near zero. The policy burden will be on the Federal Reserve. The Fed has begun to normalize monetary policy in the context of a second consecutive year of impressive nominal GDP growth (see table below). For investors, how much of that growth comes from price increases versus real growth will be critical. In our view, one of the greatest challenges this year will be navigating changes to portfolio allocations as the Fed evolves its policy stance. We think we have officially begun a two-stage process of gradual departure from emergency monetary policy conditions. The first stage being a return to a more neutral, normal monetary policy and then, secondly, a potentially more restrictive policy to address what has clearly been surprisingly high and sticky levels of inflation. First, in getting to neutral we think that over the next year and a half the Fed will bring policy rates to just below the level of potential growth (between 1.5% and 2% Fed Funds) and will allow for the run-off of the extremely large “excess-excess reserves” sitting in the banking system. It is clear at this point that the Fed has inflation firmly in its sights, despite the still maturing nature of this economic recovery, but it has also very much kept the door open to adjust policy if the economy slows from here. The velocity of money is set to bounce from historic, pandemic-induced lows The modern history of US M2 Velocity Source: Bloomberg, data as of September 30, 2021. The real economy has momentum. We think M2 velocity will bounce sharply from its lowest level in history (see graph above), buoyed by strong sentiment in both the real and financial economies, and we think credit creation could drive growth after QE ends in 2022. Accelerants of growth: technology and the net-zero economy Parts of the tech sector are set to grow exponentially over the next decade. Early investors in virtual reality, augmented reality, and similar areas are likely to be rewarded. Medical investment is set to soar, and energy infrastructure will be an important secular theme for the net-zero transition. Portfolio implications We think investors need to be able to engage market segments beyond those in the Aggregate index, including those below investment grade. We now see value in the short-to-belly segment of the U.S. Treasury market, where yields offer some downside protection for the first time since the onset of COVID. Bank loans also may perform well with a strong economy and modestly higher rates. Bespoke securitized assets in commercial real estate, consumer credit and CLOs should round out investors’ fixed income portfolios. The era in which policy floated all boats is ending. Sector selection will be key, as will deciphering dispersion within each sector. The paths of inflation and interest rates, megatrends such as digitization and decarbonization, and numerous sub-themes all look to have a profound effect on alternatives and private markets in 2022. Regional growth and inflation data are likely to result in diverging monetary policies: tightening in the U.S., the European Central Bank likely staying on hold, and the People’s Bank of China easing due to slower growth. Risk of policy error has risen, in our view, which may impact credit conditions across regions. Meanwhile, U.S. fiscal spending plans could have an outsized impact in sectors like infrastructure and healthcare, which are political priorities. That said, we are likely to see less cooperation across the political aisle as the U.S. approaches a contentious midterm election. Real assets This year is set for a broader, stronger upswing in real assets, marked by a fast rebound upon reopening and a slow rebuild to recover lost capacity. We see the cyclical rebound, technological changes and the response to climate change as three dominant drivers of the real assets outlook. At the same time, we expect the market rebound to play out differently in economies around the world, due to variations in reopening strategies, a longer-term push toward re-shored supply chains, differences across sectors, and investment shifts from other asset classes to achieve higher and more resilient yields. Infrastructure The recently passed Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act (the Act) should result in greater infrastructure investment from private capital in the U.S. We believe many of the projects included in the Act should lead to stronger economic growth and open the door for greater private investment in certain infrastructure sectors. These projects range from cyber security measures to electric grid modernization and carbon capture. The Act totals USD $1 tr over the next decade, including USD $550 bn of new spending on top of USD $450 bn that renews existing transportation funding. The funds will be distributed through grants and loans from federal agencies including the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy, tax credits and other financial incentives. The Act unlocks surface transportation for new concessions that allow private investors to come in as operators. It also encourages the use of public-private partnerships (PPP), which could lead to even more assets coming to market. Components of new spending from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (category, $ billion USD spending) Source: Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act. August, 2021. The Act also should lead to more private activity bond issuance collateralized by infrastructure assets. This process will be accomplished by allowing qualified broadband and carbon capture to become eligible for tax-exempt status, and by doubling the cap on highway tax-exempt bonds from USD $15 bn to USD $30 bn. New funding for projects elsewhere in the Act could lead to additional taxable supply. Additionally, new equity investments by private investors will create further need for infrastructure debt during the coming decade. U.S. Infrastructure debt issuance in 2015 vs. 2020 Source: Inframation, infrastructure debt issuance in U.S. in 2015 and 2020 The massive and long-running move from fossil fuels to renewables is broadening beyond wind and solar power generation, as more power segments — particularly blue and green hydrogen, carbon capture, electric vehicle charging and battery storage – take advantage of falling costs, rising scale economies and improving commercial viability. The ability to reduce the carbon footprint of cars, power plants and factories presents new commercial opportunities to achieve net zero, alongside the big and essential buildout in renewable power. For example, carbon capture could become a massive opportunity for infrastructure investors, but the technology needs improvement to be economical. Carbon sequestration is essential in the road to net zero by 2050 Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research; as of June 23, 2021. Hydrogen fuel is another example of an infrastructure technology that could be in high demand in the future with adequate funding from the Act. Utilities are quickly moving generation to renewable sources, but the two most prominent types of clean energy, solar and wind, are intermittent, and peak generation does not always match peak demand. Natural gas \"peaker\" generators, which utilities use during peak demand times, are one way to fill in the gap, and grid-level batteries can help, but both solutions have limitations. Utilities believe that hydrogen could be the key to mass deployment of renewable energy on the grid scale, but its efficiency needs to improve.1 Private companies are investing in hydrogen as a fuel, but government support can hasten the move from the fringe to a more serious component of the U.S. energy stack. 2021 was remarkable in many respects. Value rivaled growth for the first time in half a decade, earnings growth and positive earnings surprises were historically high, and inflation readings exceeded any seen by many present-day investors. What next? We see growth and value running neck and neck in 2022, offering opportunity for both investment styles. Earnings should remain strong as companies look to meet pent-up demand for products and services. Earnings surprises, on the other hand, are already moderating toward the long-run trend (see chart below). Conversely, inflation may continue to overdeliver. While inflation is a concern and a source of volatility, it also makes stocks the most compelling choice among the major asset classes. Individual companies will manage through a high-inflation environment in different ways, highlighting the importance of a stock-by-stock approach. 2022 earning outlook: Less surprising, more normalizing S&P 500 earning per share (EPS) surprise, 2003-2021 Source: BlackRock Fundamental Equities, with data from FactSet as of Nov. 10, 2021. The chart shows the average EPS surprise of companies in the S&P 500 Index, relative to consensus analyst expectations, for each quarter since 2003. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Inflation impediments Inflation is our top concern. Companies have been more than able to pass on rising costs to this point, but we’re watching inflation’s potential to squeeze profit margins, particularly if consumers become less willing to pay up for goods and services. Inflation’s impact on monetary policy is an even bigger consideration. The greatest threat to stocks’ risk-reward prospects is the possibility that nominal rates rise to the point where real interest rates are no longer negative. Despite these concerns, stocks are one of the best places to be in a world with rising inflation. Our review of data back to the 1920s finds that equities have performed well during inflationary environments when inflation wasn’t out of control (over 10%). Value stocks have performed particularly well in moderate inflation environments (5%-10%). Fiscal and monetary policy support Swift, significant and globally coordinated fiscal and monetary policy stimulus arrived early in the COVID-19 crisis and has continued throughout it, propping up economies and staving off financial crisis. Central banks are now making strategic moves away from emergency measures. In the U.S., the Fed has started to taper its monthly asset purchases, while contemplating interest rate hikes but not immediately enacting them. We acknowledge the strong risk that inflation may force the Fed to act sooner rather than later. Yet it is important to note that rates would be rising from a historically low base, and real rates are likely to remain negative. This backdrop would remain supportive for stocks. Cash comes in from the sidelines Both businesses and individuals held cash aside amid the height of the pandemic uncertainty. As confidence returned in 2021, companies deployed excess cash, with half of dividend payers in the Russell 1000 Index raising or initiating a dividend. We see even better prospects for capital returns through share buybacks and growing dividends in 2022. Household balance sheets are in good shape, unemployment is down, and wages are up. Excess cash has been finding its way into equity markets, with equity ETFs and mutual funds attracting more in 2021 than in the past 19 years combined, according to analysis from BofA Global Research and EPFR data. Although the bulk this trend may have occurred, we see room for more. The pandemic led to historic levels of fiscal stimulus being pumped into the economy. Efforts including unemployment benefits, business loans and stimulus checks helped strengthen balance sheets across the country and avoid the prolonged effects of a financial crisis. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have been building both within the U.S. and outside. Prices of commodities like oil and gasoline have climbed due to supply-chain issues and an ongoing clean-energy transition. Such changes have prompted investors to seek inflation protection in areas like commodities and real estate investment trusts (REITS). The most prominent impact on financial markets has been negative real rates in fixed-income investments. Institutional investors, trying to make up for those lost returns, have turned to alternative markets like private equity, private credit and real estate. Fiscal spend and inflation protection Our bird’s-eye view is that fiscal spending will continue to be good for growth but that repercussions tied to inflation will be with us for some time. To track the impact of the Omicron variant on shipping and other economic activity, we are monitoring indicators such as container shipping. Goods prices have been an important source of inflation over the course of the pandemic – a key difference from the previous decade. As Omicron cases peak, consumption could rotate away from goods and towards services. If this shift is sustained, there is room for goods demand to decline relative to services. U.S. Core Goods CPI vs. Core Services CPI: 2010-2020 Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics; as of January 2022. Commodities can provide inflation protection, with our research showing that energy markets have the strongest inflation-protection benefits, while industrial metals give moderate protection, and agriculture and livestock give very minimal protection. We’ve also found that real estate investment trusts, which are thought to provide an inflation hedge, don’t consistently provide protection during periods of rapid price increases. In the current market environment with accelerating inflation, investors have been sobered by the full valuations in equities and fixed income, and market volatility that has been creeping higher. Furthermore, investors are increasingly questioning the assumption that stock and bond markets are negatively correlated, weakening the diversifying properties of fixed income investments. Hence, there are more investors seeking out alternatives to tap into a broader series of returns with lower balance sheet volatility. The role of alternatives in 2022 Different institutions can have varying priorities, ranging from inflation hedging to liquidity requirements. However, these goals have often conflicted with the negative interest-rate environment in the public markets. That’s increased the need by institutions to deepen their commitments to alternative investments, such as private credit and real estate. Private credit and diversifying hedge-fund strategies can serve as replacements for fixed-income in diversified portfolios. These exposures hold the potential to deliver annual returns in the high single digits to low double digits, with benefits for a portfolio’s diversification. We believe investors should weigh concerns about illiquidity against the potential for poor performance in core fixed income. In some cases, private equity and real assets such as real estate and infrastructure can help reduce reliance on public investments. Within real assets, we’ve found that investors—depending on their needs and risk profile--can find steady cash-flow-generating assets, such as apartment buildings, or delve into special-situation and relative value investments, like distressed commercial properties. Real estate and infrastructure also present opportunities for investing with an ESG lens. For instance, some institutions have been investing in infrastructure opportunities like solar plants, wind farms and clean-energy facilities. In these volatile and inflationary times, what’s been key is to find brick-and-mortar assets to add diversification, while also aligning with the longer-term goals of institutions if they have broader aims in ESG.

       "  'content': ' Applying a long-term lens We enter 2022 with a lot to consider. The paths of inflation and interest rates, the profound effects of megatrends such as digitization and decarbonization and numerous sub-themes all demand our immediate attention. As private market investors we view this landscape with our own long-term lens. Our search is for idiosyncratic, resilient exposures within broad long-term trends. We see the world as: Within private markets, getting the trend right is only the first step. With investments that are typically hand-picked and actively managed, execution and underwriting are critical. The market regime is unusual but underwriting resilient risk-adjusted returns will always be at the heart of private market investing. Our key takeaways We believe that private markets risk premia are still attractive and can offer portfolio resilience. We expect megatrends to benefit this vintage of private markets investments, but see selection as increasingly important. The path to net zero is a major opportunity. Navigating the pathway will be an essential element of investment success. Vintage investing remains a powerful tool. Portfolio perspectives Portfolio construction is an increasingly important driver of returns. Below, we show how a private market portfolio can incorporate the themes presented in our 2022 Outlook. This is an illustrative exercise rather than an investment recommendation. The starting point is a market-weighted portfolio, where allocations are sized proportionally to the assets under management in the corresponding sectors of the Preqin universe. In the thematic portfolio, we increased our exposure to infrastructure and real estate to reflect the decarbonization and digitization themes and relative value we see in these sectors. The thematic portfolio retains exposure to technology and healthcare through its allocations to private equity and credit, while the increased weightings in infrastructure and real estate significantly reduce overall risk.

In our opinion, the year 2022 is set for a broader and stronger real asset market upswing. We think this cycle will be best understood by taking a 3D perspective. For real assets as a whole, we see the cyclical rebound, technological change and the response to climate change as three dominant drivers. At the same time, the market is driven by a decoupled rebound due to variations in reopening strategies and a longer-term push towards re-shored supply chains; a differentiated market upswing across sectors; and a competitive deployment stage, due to abundant capital moving into real assets, partly reflecting a shift from other asset classes for relatively higher and more resilient yields. For infrastructure markets, the 3Ds are decarbonization, digitalization and decentralization. The push to decarbonize the global economy requires a massive energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables, not just with the mainstays of solar and wind, but increasingly with carbon capture, battery storage and blue and green hydrogen. The digital world continues to transform our daily lives, with online work, shopping, schooling and entertainment markedly accelerated by the pandemic, as robotics and automation deliver genuine productivity gains. Moreover, infrastructure services are decentralizing on several fronts, as location becomes less important for virtual work and shopping, and as holdings diversify for resilience and operational efficiency. For real estate markets, the 3Ds of infrastructure are similarly applicable, while we see several additional drivers at work. In particular, the wide and sustained divergence in performance between the winners (sheds and beds) and losers (hotels and retail) are likely to be sustained for now, providing considerable scope for alpha from sector selection. At the same time, distressed and dislocated real estate segments are starting to show signs of deep value, although these opportunities need on-the-ground, off-market sourcing capabilities to unlock. Looking further ahead, long-run demographic drivers remain all- important, with local differences in population and ageing trends making compelling cases for childcare centers in Australia, multifamily housing in the U.S. and senior living in Japan. Three dimensions of change Uneven cyclical recoveries, tech disruption and climate risks are all impacting markets Source: BlackRock, as of December 2021. Following the re-opening rebound last year, we expect strong but decelerating growth in 2022, which remains a positive economic backdrop for credit. We expect that growth next year will differ meaningfully across regions, contributing to a wider range of outcomes. Credit markets remain a critical source of income for investors, and we believe both public and private credit should be a core holding in portfolios. The scale and complexity of global credit markets are growing rapidly, and supply chain issues, labor shortages, cost inflation and gradual tightening of financial conditions should drive higher dispersion across sectors and among issuers. Accelerating secular trends are impacting both issuers and investors in global credit markets. For issuers, capital is more widely available in both public and private forms, which has contributed to historically low default rates and the ongoing convergence of public and private markets as companies seek the capital best aligned to their particular needs. As businesses adapt to these opportunities, the greater availability and flexibility of capital may make credit cycles smaller, more frequent and sector-specific as conditions become increasingly dependent on sector dynamics. The higher yield and proportion of return from income coupled with lower interest-rate sensitivity keeps credit attractive relative to fixed income assets, in our view. Private debt is a growing source of finance Total debt outstanding excluding dry powder (US$m notional) Source: JP Morgan, Preqin Ltd. as of 27 October 2021. Private debt amounts exclude dry powder. U.S. HY/LL = JP Morgan U.S. High Yield and Leveraged Loan Indices. European HY/LL = JP Morgan European High Yield and Leveraged Loan Indices. Our outlook for 2022 is one of cautious optimism. Private equity as an asset class has demonstrated its resilience in the last two years. Valuations remain full, even for companies that have had to bounce back from the pandemic’s effects. Transactions continue to grow in size and are becoming increasingly global. We believe there is room for continued growth and we expect the current rapid pace of investment to continue in 2022, supported by low interest rates, open capital markets and an abundance of dry powder after two years of strong fundraising. The size of the private equity market has tripled in the last decade, from nearly US$2 trillion in 2010 to over US$6 trillion in November 2021, according to Preqin. The number of active private equity investors has tripled as well, as access is democratized and increasingly multi-dimensional. While many may worry we have reached a peak, we see little evidence for a slowdown in the short term. In fact, we see room for growth, as private equity evolves and enlarges its still comparatively small share of the overall equity markets through tools such as secondaries and more flexible structures. Secondaries have proven a practical tool for efficient portfolio management, as well as an effective tool for GPs or LPs seeking liquidity. The increased number of GP-led non-traditional secondaries in 2021 shows the desire for innovative structures, as GPs explore secondary capital as an avenue to achieve liquidity in specific companies. In effect, secondary capital allows GPs to own assets for up to 8-10 years versus a traditional hold period of four years. Both LPs and GPs continue to seek creative and scalable ways to unlock greater value and extend the longevity of strong companies in their portfolios. The growth of longer-term funds, fund extensions facilitated by the secondary market and continuation vehicles or annex funds into which GPs roll existing investments are all signs of an evolving and increasingly versatile market.

       "  'content': ' This piece was originally published in Fortune on 12/17/21. Americans are industrious people. When we were forced into quarantine last year, we quickly figured out how to carry on from our living rooms and our kitchens. Thanks to the power of the internet, we stayed connected to work, school, friends, and family. We didn’t all have the same tools, however. The digital divide became blisteringly apparent during COVID, as nearly 20% of American households were disconnected from the internet. Typical work-arounds like Wi-Fi at offices, schools, and cafes were not available during the quarantine. So while most Americans kept learning and working remotely, those without broadband fell far behind. It’s obvious by now that the internet is not a luxury. Just like electricity, internet access is essential to modern life. We’ve also learned from the experience of home schooling that the internet is critical to providing equal access to education. Yet too many people still don’t have access. We now have an opportunity to fix this. The historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will upgrade nearly all parts of our country’s infrastructure, including US$65 billion dedicated to improving broadband access. But US$65 billion only goes so far. Even with the expected build-out, current speeds won’t improve much, and slow connections are a big obstacle to remote work and learning. How can we expect people to pull themselves up from their bootstraps if they don’t have access to the internet? This paradigm applies across most parts of the legislation - aviation, renewable energy, waste management, water conservation, and especially public transport. The bill’s investment will get us far, but not quite far enough. The underlying issue is that the US simply does not spend enough to build and maintain high quality infrastructure. We’re the largest economy in the world, yet we lag almost all G20 nations in infrastructure spending, and we rank below average in infrastructure quality rankings. There is an obvious solution here: we need more private funding alongside the public spending. Fortunately, private investors not only have the capital, they also have strong desire to invest in our country’s infrastructure. To put this in context, the legislation allocates US$1.2 trillion in spending, versus the infrastructure funding gap of US$2.6 trillion. US institutional investors could easily make up the shortfall – after all, they represent over US$20 trillion in capacity, some of which is already allocated to infrastructure. (US investors today deploy more to international projects because there are not enough domestic opportunities.) There’s also a misperception that allowing the investment community to participate in these projects will pad the wallets of the super-rich. This is simply untrue and we’ve got to get over it. The vast majority of institutional investment in the US comes from pensions, 401(k)s, and non-profits like foundations, endowments and hospitals. Generating a return on these investments supports retirement, education, philanthropy and healthcare. Infrastructure, in particular, is important for retirement accounts because they have similar timelines. The income streams from projects such as roads and bridges match up nicely against long-term retirement benefits. Infrastructure also aligns with institutional investors’ values. Many universities would like to lower their carbon emissions, and would gladly provide capital to invest in decarbonization pipelines if the opportunities were available. Other investors would help close the digital divide by funding projects that support broadband expansion, satellite internet and fiber. Private investment would also increase accountability and fill gaps with high quality expertise not always available in the public sector. Studies have found that when the private sector is involved, infrastructure projects are more likely to meet deadlines and stay within budget. We have a blueprint for how successful this can be. Canadian pensions have long leveraged infrastructure investments to get retirement dollars to their participants. They view infrastructure as a standalone asset class and allocate significant capital to it, and the Canadian government facilitates this with oversight and support from an infrastructure bank. If we can get all these parts to work similarly in the US, we can fund more improvements that will benefit all Americans. Currently, the legislation does offer a few openings for private public partnerships. We need to encourage the government to incorporate private funding as it administers these projects, and to guide public and private enterprise to work as partners. This would be a winning arrangement that would bring a true alignment of interests and, best of all, would create a shared stake in the future of our country. Read this piece on Fortune.

But history is instructive, and it tells us that times of pain can be ideal moments to position for future gains. As the second half begins, we see: Market direction driven by Fed machinations Need for diversification and resilience in equity portfolios An underappreciated opportunity in healthcare stocks Market overview and outlook The first five months of the year marked the worst start for the S&P 500 since 1970 ― and the sixth worst back to 1928.* While caution is warranted, we believe the equity risk premium (ERP) continues to make a case for equities. Stock valuations have come down, but company earnings remain solid. This keeps the ERP ― which compares the earnings yield on the S&P 500 to bond yields ― above its historical average. Our models suggest the 10-year Treasury yield would have to rise to 4% or earnings decline by more than 20% for the perceived “margin of safety” in stocks over bonds to disappear. Earnings will slow, but 20% is hard to imagine, even in a recession. The average earnings drop in prior recessions was 13%, with the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) skewing the results. See chart below. All eyes on earningsS&P 500 earnings decline in recessions, 1957-2020 Playing offense through defense While it is important to maintain a long-term lens, particularly when investing for long-term goals, it is also prudent to protect and position portfolios for the prevailing environment ― a key advantage of active management. Today’s uncertainty argues for a focus on stability and resilience. Waiting on the Fed The Fed’s ability to raise interest rates and reduce its balance sheet in a way that neither inflames inflation nor stifles economic growth will have significant bearing on the market backdrop. We are not calling for a recession, but we are cognizant that the risks of a recession are rising: The Fed is tightening monetary policy, bringing an end to “easy money” policies; 30-year mortgage rates have climbed from 3% last year to nearly 6% today; inflation is beginning to erode household savings; and inventories of goods are elevated as both pandemic-induced supply shortages and voracious demand ease. If the Fed tightens too much, the result could be a recession. If it tightens too little, inflation is the greater threat. The ideal scenario runs in the middle, allowing for a soft landing as policy transitions. We are not placing odds on any particular outcome but are generally positioning more defensively. The optimal portfolio to combat inflation is very different from the optimal portfolio for a recession. We advocate using a barbell strategy to position for these competing outcomes. This includes owning energy and financials as inflation fighters, and healthcare for a dose of resilience. We find other traditionally defensive sectors, including utilities and staples, to be expensive relative to the broader market. The weight of inflation Notably, our analysis of sector dynamics during the Great Inflation period of the 1970s found energy, financials and healthcare to be the top performers. While the backdrop is different today, we do believe these three sectors could outpace the broader market once again, with financials potentially doing even better in this cycle given stronger bank balance sheets after restructuring and rigorous stress testing in the wake of the GFC. Inflation surfaced as the perceived greatest risk to equity markets over the next six months in a BlackRock Fundamental Equities survey of more than 1,000 U.S. investors. See chart below. What are Americans doing in the face of higher prices? 50% reported reducing their discretionary spending while 26% said they have made no changes. Inflation seen as biggest risk to stocksTop-five concerns among investors surveyed, May 2022 Maintaining a long-term lens Uncertainty is high and daily volatility can test investors’ fortitude.

       "  'content': ' In the 1985 cult classic “Back to the Future,” actor Michael J. Fox plays a teenager who travels back in time and gets stuck in the past, trying desperately to return “back to the future.” For investors, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ latest inflation report may raise feelings of déjà vu and concerns about economies, and subsequently markets, being stuck in their own time warp; a return to the inflationary 1970s. However, this isn’t the first time the world has been worried about a return to the 1970s. In fact, ever since the 1970s, almost any period of above-consensus inflation has been met with headlines that have alluded to the 1970s in some form or other, a trend perfectly encapsulated in The Economist cover from mid-2004 (see Figure 1). Suffice to say, the 1970s aren’t usually the first thing that comes to mind when we look back at the 2000s from today’s vantage point. Figure 1: 1970s-fearing headlines are not a new phenomenon Source: The Economist, June 19, 2004 Still, maybe 2021 is less different than before, as there are some apparent similarities? We’ve witnessed the end of a long war (Vietnam in the 1970s versus Afghanistan in 2021), we’re in a supply chain crisis (the 1970s was a decade known for shortages) and in the midst of a cold war (substitute the Soviet Union for China). Yet, despite these similarities, there are three main reasons why economies aren’t going back to the 1970s. Three Key Reasons This Isn’t the 1970s for the Economy First, organic demand growth in terms of new disposable income is not going back to the 1970s. In the United States, the share of new workers, as measured by the 15-34 year age group, peaked in 1980 alongside inflation. That age group is an important driver of growth and inflation because, on average, they make several critical first-time purchases, buying their first car, having their first child and buying their first house, often on credit. Separately, another source of new disposable income, female participation in the labor force, had its greatest gain in the 1970s. So, while demand is certainly exceptional today (as we described in our previous commentary, Halloween and Christmas for Markets, these 1970s-era drivers were one-time phenomena. Second, supply and consumption patterns have changed dramatically since the 1970s and are unlikely to reverse course. The development of the global supply chain had two pivotal moments: first, when Deng Xiaopeng opened up China’s economy in 1979, and second, when China joined the WTO in 2001. Each time, world trade inflected higher, dwarfing GDP growth (see Figure 2). These events allowed huge quantities of new supply to enter the global economy, from goods to labor, both flattening the supply curve and pushing it to the right. This deflationary impact of globalization on goods, decade after decade, has allowed consumption to be increasingly oriented around services – until very recently, as the pandemic has temporarily disrupted the consumption of a variety of services. But today’s supply chain bottlenecks, the result of an unusual two-year surge in goods demand, do not foreshadow a systemic unwind of the structure of the global economy, in our view, or of modern consumption patterns (think Millennials’ love of “experiences”). Figure 2: It’s hard to see world trade going back to the 1970s Source: International Monetary Fund, data as of July 31, 2021 Third, we can’t talk about the 1970s without mentioning how influential oil prices were, and how unlikely it is for those influences to repeat themselves. Over the course of that decade, oil prices went from about USD$2 to USD$32, and it’s difficult to see that 16-fold gain in oil prices happening again, given the unique shocks that drove it then, from the end of Bretton Woods to the Iranian Revolution (see Figure 3). In the case of the former, currencies that have been unpegged from a gold standard cannot then be unpegged again. And in the case of the latter, new oil-supply-shock absorbers have been introduced since then: namely OPEC and the rise of the U.S. shale industry. In fact, through a 1970s lens, oil has been stable for decades. Meanwhile, the consumer’s wallet has continued growing alongside, such that consumption is a lot less energy intensive today than it was then. Indeed, gasoline is only about 2% of the U.S. consumer’s wallet today, down from about 6% in 1980. Thus, higher energy prices this winter can lift energy asset prices, in our view, but won’t destroy the consumer’s pocketbook. Figure 3: Through a 1970’s lens, oil has been stable for decades Source: Bloomberg, data as of October 31, 2021 Yet Are There Market and Policy Parallels to the ‘70s? So, economies won’t go back to the 1970s – but it’s a bit more complicated for markets. When real yields are too high or too low, they can flip the traditional stock/bond correlation. In the 1970s, real yields were deeply negative, as they are now. That “1970s style” stock/bond correlation is a worry because modern portfolios are built on risk parity-like characteristics (meaning bond yields are expected to decline when stock prices decline), but current yield levels don’t leave as much room for fixed income to make as much of a positive contribution to portfolios as it has in recent decades. On a shorter lookback, the deeply entrenched long-term correlation between U.S. equity markets (proxied by the S&P 500 here) and U.S. Treasuries has broken down (see Figure 4), injecting volatility into portfolios. In the absence of duration as a reliable hedge, portfolios may need to own volatility through options, or simply hold more cash instead (a measure we previously described in our commentary, The Queen’s Gambit Declined). Figure 4: Correlation between S&P 500 return and 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield Sources: Bloomberg and BlackRock, data as of October 31, 2021 In our view, the single biggest parallel between the 1970s and the 2020s is not inflation, but the ability of extreme monetary policy to influence future market returns. The shock-and-awe policy of the late 1970s came in the form of a policy rate hiking cycle that culminated in a 20% Federal Funds rate to combat inflation. So far in the 2020s, it’s been a doubling of the monetary base – essentially printing USD$3 trillion – to stimulate consumption (Figure 5). Figure 5: Different decade, similar shock-and-awe policy response Source: Federal Reserve, data as of October 31, 2021 Lessons Learned From History Fascinatingly, both these policy measures create the same forward influence on the denominator of the terminal value equation: the discount rate less the growth rate, or “r-g.” By 1980, a high Fed Funds rate meant that portfolios should be oriented around a falling discount rate (“r”) for years afterward, while today’s liquidity regime means that portfolios should be oriented around a sticky high growth rate (“g”) – again, potentially lasting for years. A declining “r,” or a rising “g,” are both supportive of asset prices, mathematically speaking, but the former makes assets with high fixed interest rates exceptionally attractive, while the latter supports assets with cash flows that can capture higher growth rates. So, when it comes to asset allocation, the 1970s do in fact offer a valuable lesson for portfolios in 2021, just not quite a parallel, rather than a yin/yang image: overweight nominal assets in 1980, but overweight real assets today. Indeed, the harder it is for an asset to be printed, the more “real” it is, and if it can generate a steady stream of cash flow, then all the better. '},\n",

In this paper, we explore building a Paris-aligned equity strategy as part of a broader multi-asset portfolio and the impact on alpha generation from incorporating sustainable insights. Climate-aware alpha drivers Companies meeting the ambitions set out in the Paris Agreement are increasingly benefiting from higher demand and increased firm value. Climate-aware alphas including carbon resource efficiency, green patents, and corporate target setting are linked to quality measures such as productivity and profitability. Take carbon emissions as an example – firm-level data demonstrates that companies with lower carbon intensity exhibit higher excess returns on average. These companies tend to have a lower cost of capital, higher productivity, and increased efficiency making them better positioned for alpha generation. A critical step to net zero: Decarbonization Along with analyzing carbon emissions data at the company level, incorporating carbon reduction targets at the portfolio level enhances climate outcomes and adds to portfolio returns. Using a minimum requirement of 50% relative carbon reduction vs. the benchmark along with a 7% per annum decarbonization rate allows investors to achieve a true Paris-aligned portfolio forging a path of continued reduction in carbon emissions. Decarbonization path of a portfolio Source: BlackRock, as of June 2021. For illustrative purposes only. The graph shows an illustrative decarbonization path of a Paris-aligned portfolio. Capitalizing on the climate transition Limiting global warming to well below 2ºC and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 are sizable goals that are required in order to avoid the devastating impact of climate change. The reallocation of capital towards technologies, companies and countries fundamental for the energy transition calls for an evolved approach to building equity portfolios. In our view, a Paris-aligned framework considering sustainability alongside traditional risk and return objectives is crucial for capitalizing on the economic shift taking place. '},\n",

Aligning multi-asset portfolios to net zero comes with unique challenges and is achieved by evolving the integration of ESG considerations into the investment process.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Multi-asset investors: Moving from climate pledges to practice The Paris Agreement seeks to reduce emissions to limit the global temperature increase. This is often equated to transitioning to a “net zero” global economy by 2050. Investors globally are focusing on decarbonization. In March 2021, 22 asset owners with US$1.2 trillion in assets committed to cutting their portfolios’ carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.1 Because so few companies are currently aligned to net zero, we believe it’s impractical to build a diversified net zero portfolio. Rather, aligning a portfolio requires a multi-year pathway. Despite potential benefits to those who are early to the era of climate investing, aligning multi-asset portfolios to net zero comes with unique challenges and is achieved by evolving the integration of ESG considerations into the investment process. A framework is, therefore, our preferred approach as opposed to a single investment decision. This framework should facilitate change but be flexible enough to adapt to the portfolio’s progress in meeting decarbonization targets. Carbon metrics across asset classes To build a portfolio that is aligned to the objectives of the Paris Agreement, we start by assessing various carbon metrics including absolute emissions and emissions intensity. For illustrative purposes, we review absolute emissions and emissions relative to enterprise value for a strategic asset allocation for a UK Defined Contribution pension scheme. We find that the two approaches are complementary. One striking observation is the absolute emissions. Getting this to net zero is a huge task. Intensity allows a more considered view as it adjusts for the size of the underlying companies on a like-for-like basis. We also observe some key implications for multi-asset investors: firstly, no asset class is the same. Different asset classes will have different pathways. Emerging markets, for example, are associated with a higher emissions intensity than developed markets. However, these carbon metrics should serve as a monitoring function rather than an input to dictate investment decisions. these metrics only show part of the picture: a historic snapshot of how these asset classes look today and therefore what the starting point is for the investor. We therefore advocate the use of these metrics for reporting and monitoring purposes. Using forward-looking metrics alongside these will be crucial in the design of the investment strategy. Evolving portfolio monitoring to include “decarbonization milestones” The design of an overarching strategy to align with the Paris Agreement will vary as a function of the portfolio’s asset allocation and investors’ different risk/return objectives. Therefore, there will be no “one size fits all” approach, although there is a common framework that multi-asset investors can apply to their portfolios. Firstly, we advocate setting interim milestones between now and 2050. The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, for example, has proposed setting interim targets for 2030 in order to reduce the uncertainty associated with achieving the appropriate “decarbonization pathway”. We also propose an annual review to ensure the portfolio is on track. This will be in part to ensure that companies who have set targets are meeting them and if not, to set a remediation process (such as through engaging with the company). It is also an opportunity to monitor whether there are new companies setting targets, since this may increase the level of confidence that the decarbonization rate can be met at the overall asset class level. An implementation plan that assesses a range of building blocks In order to build diversified portfolios, we blend index, factor and alpha-seeking strategies. Each building block has its own characteristics and complements the others. Investors can select building blocks that explicitly align with the Paris Agreement. Understanding how each asset class fares today and combining that with forward-looking decarbonization rates guides investors towards which asset classes are most crucial to replace today. Those that are not replaced may still be influenced by a clear voting and engagement policy. We use indexes in portfolio construction to access broad market exposures in a cost-efficient manner. Some screened approaches that eliminate exposure to certain business areas or optimization strategies that seek to enhance the sustainable features within a stated tracking error. Next, factor portfolios invest in broad and persistent drivers of return. Like indexes, factor portfolios can align to the Paris Agreement by systematically incorporating minimum standards for decarbonization and more. Finally, we can use alpha-seeking strategies to access exposures which contribute to the transition with the benefit of potentially brining emissions down and generating alpha. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Had the modern beach ball existed in ancient Greece, many at that time may have had difficulty in understanding why it took so much effort to push it underwater, and why, upon being released underwater, it would jump dramatically from the water before floating in equilibrium at the surface. That is, until Greek mathematician and polymath Archimedes discovered the principle of buoyancy around the year 212 B.C. In some respects, a negative real yield resembles a beach ball being held underwater, in the sense that they are both below their equilibrium levels. Historically, real yields have been correlated with real economic growth, but in 2021 real growth is on track to post its highest reading since World War II, while real yields are at their lowest point in history (see Figure 1). In our analogy, this would create the equivalent of a massive buoyant force on a fully submerged beach ball. In the world of physics, Archimedes’ Principle would allow us to calculate this exact buoyant force, based on factors like the size of the ball and the extent to which it has been submerged, but it is a little more complicated in the world of real yields and portfolios. The financial markets today are huge (certainly much bigger than at any time in history), and the hands pushing real yields down (the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank) are extremely strong. Figure 1: U.S. real yields are near historically low levels, like a beach ball being held underwater Source: Bloomberg, data as of September 14, 2021 Two decades of dramatic market change Interestingly, while real yields are at record lows, the supply of financial assets is at record highs, suggesting a robust demand for income. In the month of September alone, $625 billion of new supply is expected across U.S. Treasury, credit and equity markets, which is considerably greater than the $400 billion monthly average in recent years, according to BlackRock Capital Markets data, as of September 12, 2021. That fact certainly places a potential $15 billion-a-month Fed asset purchase taper into perspective (as it would represent a mere 2% of September’s supply) and it illustrates that quantitative easing (QE) in general is perhaps needlessly competing with organic demand for fixed income assets to keep yields at unsustainably low levels. Central banks’ intent to hold the “real rate beach ball” underwater belies some of the changes that our economy has undergone in just the last two decades. As we remember the 20-year anniversary of 9/11 this month, we are awestruck by some of the changes to markets since that time. Some of those changes include, the evolving nature of e-commerce, the way we interact with each other on social media (spending three hours and 43 minutes each day on our devices, on average) and the huge role China now plays in the global economy. In fact, China has grown its GDP 17x since entering the WTO in 2001, which should perhaps outweigh the Fed taper discussion in terms of long-term investment implications, in our view. Still, arguably the most significant change in financial markets over the last two decades has been one of the most subtle: the onset of the “Liquidity Era” (as we wrote about in The Policy Liquidity Monopoly). Pre-9/11, the real economy was the independent variable that drove financial economy outcomes. However, today it’s the financial economy that is the independent variable driving real economy outcomes. Indeed, liquidity provision has become the primary tool of global monetary policy (rather than interest rate manipulation), through channels like wealth effects, as evidenced by the more than doubling in size of global financial markets relative to world GDP over the last 20 years. It is in this context that we face a liquidity cliff today: having injected nearly $1.5 trillion year-to-date through August, the U.S. Treasury will likely make large liquidity withdrawals before year-end, which could actually transcend ongoing Fed asset purchases. Thus, the flow of liquidity is set to wane demonstrably at a time when real rates are priced through fair value. Yet even with new liquidity injections becoming greatly diminished, the existing stock of liquidity, both domestically and globally, is historic, with investors who are sitting on cash salivating over any yield, or return potential, of reasonable quality that looks to be available. In fact, growth in cash has far outpaced growth in loan demand since the onset of the pandemic, leaving banks flush with deposits and starved for yield (see Figure 2). As a result, trillions of dollars in bank deposits continue to compete with traditional fixed income investors for relatively scarce high-quality assets. Figure 2: U.S. cash deposits have greatly outstripped loan growth Sources: Federal Reserve and Bloomberg, data as of August 31, 2021 Indeed, there is so much cash (liquidity) in the world and such low yields that one might even forget that in an equilibrium state the “beach ball” floats on the surface of the water. Having posted roughly a 12% total return year-to-date, through September 14, the 60/40 balanced portfolio (60% S&P 500, 40% U.S. Aggregate Bond) is on pace to beat 2020’s handsome return of 14%. But unlike in 2019 and 2020, in which both the equity and fixed income sides of the portfolio contributed to total returns, in 2021 so far only the equity portion has made a positive contribution. The fact is that from these levels of yield, it is extremely difficult to preserve purchasing power in fixed income, revealing the difficulty in getting the “40%” of the balanced portfolio to contribute to price returns. Why is such easy policy being maintained? Some believe that technology will eliminate jobs that were lost during the pandemic, such that job growth will slow from here, rendering a full recovery in labor force participation impossible. However, historical newspaper records show that this fear of technology “stealing jobs” has been around for centuries, as every new technology has replaced an older one, with no evidence of a decline in aggregate jobs available (in fact, they have grown in line with population growth). The reality of the labor market today is quite the opposite of this dire view: labor supply is more constrained relative to demand than ever before. There are 70% more job openings than there were pre-pandemic and 10% fewer people looking for work – the largest gap between those measures in history. Others argue that if inflation is transitory that should mitigate risks to keeping policy easy (in other words, letting the economy run hot). In our view, while recent inflation should moderate toward historical averages over time, the risk of deflation at this stage seems even more remote, given how far above trend inflation stands today (see Figure 3). So, the balance of probabilities actually suggests a normalization of policy could be a risk-mitigant rather than the other way around, when it comes to price stability. Figure 3: Core CPI is running considerably higher than Its pre-covid trend Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, data as of August 31, 2021 Another, potentially greater, risk of keeping policy too easy for too long is financial asset inflation. While valuations in housing and stock markets are not in bubble territory yet, in our estimation, keeping policy too easy for too long may create the risk of financial instability going forward. Given how the financial economy has become the independent variable driving real economy outcomes, a volatile financial economy could create unstable real economy outcomes. Indeed, house prices are less affordable (relative to income levels) than at any time since the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, resulting in declining consumer confidence of late. The main problem today is a supply shortage, not one of weak demand, and supply can’t be “stimulated” by monetary policy in the way that demand can. If central banks don’t gradually normalize policy, demand can continue to push higher, well through supply availability (of goods, services, houses, labor, etc.), creating a risky and unnecessary inflationary shock – at the very least in financial assets. Hence, we need to think about portfolio balance in 2021 in the context of drastically different environmental conditions relative to history - where supply is weighing on growth, and not demand – with demand for goods, services, and assets being pushed higher via further policy liquidity injections. So, how do we manage a portfolio in light of these crosscurrents? Rather than suggesting a greater risk premium be applied to equities, low interest rates and strong growth can be a powerful cocktail for risky assets. If interest rates are capped to the upside by waiting on a pre-pandemic notion of full employment, textbook financial analysis suggests that it can create powerful convexity in the terminal value of equities. Historically, risk-free rates would approximate terminal growth, both reflecting the same economy, and keeping a company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) somewhat in line with its terminal growth rate. But Fed policy essentially has the terminal growth rate acting as a ceiling for the cost of debt (a component in the WACC), creating massive convexity in the terminal value because the cost of debt can go below, but not above, the terminal growth rate (see Figure 4). Figure 4: Recent fed policy essentially sets economic growth rate as ceiling for risk-free cost of debt Source: Bloomberg, data as of September 14, 2021 So, despite the 60/40 portfolio being “imbalanced” (where the 40% fixed income allocation has been underperforming relative to history), the same low-rate and high-growth backdrop that is creating this imbalance also gives us some comfort in the power of an equity allocation. We take further comfort in the fact that recent equity performance has not been just a market phenomenon – book value has also been accreting at the fastest pace in decades. In fact, the average level of S&P 500 return on equity (ROE) never dipped below 15% throughout the pandemic and it is expected to reach a record 23% by the end of 2021, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates, as of September 10 (see Figure 5). If book value continues to accrete higher at this pace, the media’s fascination with records may be satiated for a long time to come, as equity market values rise in tandem to fresh record high levels. Figure 5: The SPX return on equity has remained remarkably strong throughout the pandemic Source: Bloomberg, data as of September 10, 2021 Some companies are significantly outperforming even the lofty ROE gains of the index. The equity of companies that are on the “right side” of megatrends, especially in the technology and healthcare sectors, have historically been the greatest beneficiaries of high-growth and low-rate environments (see Figure 6). And there has arguably never been a better environment for book value accretion, and hence return, for these kinds of companies. We like companies with long forward trajectories of growing cash flows and strong balance sheets that are investing significantly on capital expenditures (capex) and research & development (R&D) to drive growth. The combination of long-term investment, plentiful cash, and low debt burdens suggests a medium-term permanence to cash flow growth. Such companies have come to dominate the market capitalization leaderboard in the S&P 500 over the last 20 years. That trend is likely to continue, as technology-enabled creative destruction continues to keep opportunities open for new companies to disrupt old ones, also resulting in exciting private and venture investments on the horizon. Of course, with the many headline risks facing markets today (China worries, debt ceiling debates, Fed asset purchase tapering), alongside some supply-chain troubles and slower economic growth (at a time of year when investment conviction and risk-taking tend to be lower), the risk of equity markets pricing down 5%, or so, has moved higher. Still, we think any short-term disruption is likely to be modest before equities continue to move higher. Figure 6: Return on equity of key sectors can be even greater Source: Bloomberg, data as of August 9, 2021 China is another area that we think stands out, for having an inconsistent representation in the global economy versus the financial markets. While China is slated to make up about 20% of the global economy five years from now, up from 18% today (see Figure 7), and a close second to the U.S. in its overall economic size, at $24 trillion versus $28 trillion (International Monetary Fund estimates, as of December 31, 2020), its representation in global indices is a mere 4% in the MSCI All Country World Index and a slightly better 7% in the Global Aggregate bond index. Currently, only three of the top 100 companies in the world (by market capitalization) are China-based today, yet China is the second largest source of unicorns (startups with a >$1 billion valuation), after the U.S. That suggests that places like China may offer targeted, high-growth opportunities for investment, albeit with some patience in the broader market, amidst an evolving regulatory framework. In the short run, we think it’s important to remain cautious about where and how one takes advantage of investment opportunities in China, but it’s also a time when longer-term opportunities are presenting themselves. Figure 7: China’s rapidly growing share of economic activity isn’t yet reflected in equity and bond index representation Source: International Monetary Fund, data as of December 31, 2020 The phenomenon of central banks crowding investors out of high-quality fixed income suggests that portfolio balance should indeed mean owning less of the low yielding, high-quality, part of the investment universe, with a larger allocation to yields that look more reasonable relative to inflation expectations, particularly in bespoke and less-liquid regions of fixed income, with a moderate emerging market debt allocation. With securitized markets growing again, securitized products may offer another such source of reasonable yield, especially on unique pools of assets that help with diversification (see Figure 8). We think high-quality securitized assets are too rich, but we like mid-quality paper (with proper underwriting). Taking a closer look at the capital stack, it’s evident that there are limited opportunities to take risk and still get attractive yield. One simply must work harder to find, structure, and analyze potential investments today. Figure 8: Securitized markets offer another potential source of reasonable yield Source: J.P. Morgan, data as of July 6, 2021 Last month, we posed the question of what to do with high quality fixed income in this submerged beach ball environment, in order to create balance in a portfolio, and our answer was: little (as we wrote about in Being Vested in Your Investing). The Agg has returned 0.06% since August 1, 2021, underscoring that point. In high quality fixed income, we are not sure where the value is today either. The threat of submerged (negative) real yields succumbing to buoyant forces and violently returning to their position of equilibrium as policy evolution looms is causing a lot of consternation in the financial media. To us, it simply reinforces the notion of being committed to names that have some combination of risk premium, growth potential and winning track records. '},\n",

The worldwide uncertainty surrounding COVID vaccines and variants, fiscal and monetary policy responses, and changing behaviors compounds this difficulty. Our Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions (MASS) team lays out how we assess inflation drivers and respond to help clients build resilient portfolios. Long-term sustained rise, short-term uncertainty Potential reasons for higher prices include higher production costs and deglobalization in the wake of COVID, new central bank policies that allow inflation “overshoots” to make up for past misses, and a risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored amid greater debt loads. We believe inflation is likely to be higher in the medium to long-term and portfolios should be positioned for this potential shift. However, we should avoid extrapolating too much from the extraordinarily high inflation readings in recent months, as they have been driven by factors that we feel are unlikely to be repeated over time. Putting it in practice As we seek to build portfolios that are more resilient to inflation, our portfolio construction approach is both diversified – deploying a wide universe of instruments and exposures – and dynamic – adaptable as circumstances change. For example, we may express our views on inflation in multi-asset portfolios by reducing exposure to fixed income while diversifying into equities that can protect against inflation such as banks and energy stocks. We can also allocate to asset classes like commodities and inflation-linked bonds. A long-term lens The importance of employing a diversified approach goes beyond these tactical expressions of our views. Our research suggests that stocks and bonds are more highly correlated in higher inflation regimes. As shown in below, the sensitivity of the stock-bond correlation to inflation has approached global highs as coordinated policy response to COVID has made inflation a key macro driver of asset prices. The implication for portfolios is that bonds may serve as a less effective source of diversification in high inflation environments. We assert that this calls for a thoughtful, whole portfolio approach to meeting client’s investment objectives.

       "  'content': ' What to expect Global real assets investors have been increasingly focused on inflation, as surging demand and stockpiling alongside supply constraints is driving up price pressures. In this paper, we discuss our views on inflation, whether it is transitory and where it will go. More importantly, we will discuss the reasons why real assets may perform well in periods of higher inflation, and tools and strategies real assets investors should deploy in a higher inflationary environment. Higher, not runaway Economic reopening, combined with record levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus, higher production costs and realignment of global supply chains is driving a robust outlook for economic growth and the highest inflation expectations in almost a decade. Inflation should build steadily over the medium term, well above the Fed’s 2% target. Supply constraints and surging demand will likely keep short-term inflation more volatile. The BlackRock Investment Institute (BII) sees inflation near 3% in five years, above current breakeven rates, but well below 1970s levels of hyperinflation. Inflation-linked Returns from both real estate and infrastructure have positive correlation to inflation, especially when it is combined with high economic growth. Real assets can capture inflation through greater income growth due to higher rent growth, occupancy, and increased demand for the underlying good such as electricity. The risk of accelerated expense growth is primarily mitigated through (1) contractual adjustments in leases or contracts, (2) expense pass-throughs, (3) higher replacement costs, and (4) beneficial leverage. Real assets have historically outperformed in inflationary environments Real assets outperform traditional asset classes during high inflation environments.

The figures shown relate to past performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. You cannot invest directly in an unmanaged index. High growth periods are when U.S. GDP > 2.5% and high inflation periods are when U.S. CPI > 2.5%. Focus on what you can control Inflation, interest rates and rents or rates are determined by the market and cannot be controlled by investors. Thus, it is best to focus on what one can control when structuring deals and building portfolios. Term & structure: Shorter lease terms would allow rents to mark-to-market more often, thus benefitting the investor. While longer-term, take-or-pay contracts for midstream investments could also offer some degree of explicit inflation management as revenues rise with higher demand. Leases or contracts with annual bumps in-line with inflation and expense pass throughs are preferred. Asset characteristics: Assets in low supply markets will likely benefit from a high growth and inflationary environment. What is more important than the topic of inflation are the accelerating trends of e-commerce, migration to less dense areas, digitization and decarbonization driving the different real assets sectors. Debt term & structure: Levered assets with longer-term fixed rate debt would benefit in an inflationary environment, as debt gets paid down with inflated dollars over time. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Our approach to impact investing in public equities We believe an impact investing strategy in public equities should be built on the foundational concept of “additionality.” Additionality in this context means that, but for this contribution, that outcome would not have occurred, so impact is created. It’s key to the impact approach. Explore how innovative businesses deliver positive impact to people and the planet in two examples below. Additionality is the key to driving impact For a company to provide additionality based on our standard, a majority of its products and services must address a need that is unlikely to be fulfilled by others (such as competitors or governments), thereby creating a genuine impact that addresses that need. We also require additionality from ourselves as investors. With a long-term, ownership mindset, impact investors in public equities create impact by providing an exit for private enterprises pursuing impact; supplying the capital needed for impact companies to grow; engaging with companies to enhance impact outcomes; increasing the visibility of undervalued impact companies, and democratizing access to impact investing. At the asset class level, by offering impact investing through public equities, a broad new cohort of investors can participate and provide much needed capital to solve some of the world’s great problems. It is long past time for the democratization of impact investing. Impact on people: solutions spotlight on Bank Rakyat Based on our research as of 2020, Bank Rakyat is the largest microlender and financial services provider in Indonesia, where approximately half the adult population remains unbanked. In addition to microlending, the bank provides services including financial literacy training programs, savings vehicles and insurance products, helping to foster financial resilience, empowerment and economic opportunity for underserved communities. Bank Rakyat’s microlending business targets micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, rural communities and underserved individuals. Indonesia is an archipelago with over 10,000 islands; approximately 6,000 of them are inhabited. Due to the dispersed population across these thousands of islands, it is difficult to scale traditional business models that rely on physical locations. Bank Rakyat has built a financial agent network that allows its services to reach even the most rural areas of Indonesia’s islands, reflecting an innovative business model specific to local needs. Impact on the planet: solutions spotlight on Vestas Wind Systems As a wind energy and technology leader, Vestas designs, manufactures, installs and services wind turbines globally. It is responsible for a diverse portfolio of wind turbines that can operate in multiple environments, even in extreme weather conditions, onshore and offshore.1 Vestas’ strategy seeks to expand the world’s use of wind energy through its leading, efficient technology and lower-cost business model. Vestas’ advanced technology also increases the efficiency of renewable energy generation, with a single wind turbine producing 30 to 50 times more energy than it consumes in a lifetime.2 Wind energy grew by 23% annually between 1990-2018, and we believe wind power is positioned for continued, structural growth.3 Since inception in 1981 through 2020, Vesta’s operations have avoided 1.4 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions,4 which is the equivalent of avoiding the emissions from 1 billion passenger vehicles driven in one year.

       "  'description': 'BlackRock experts discuss how investors can tap into opportunities across China’s US$23 trillion onshore equity and bond markets.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Overview In 2020, China’s onshore equity and bond markets grew to over US$23 trillion in assets, but exposure to China remains only a small fraction of most investor’s portfolios. As we look ahead into the rest of 2021 and beyond, China has been top of mind for many of our clients. It’s huge, it’s growing, it’s ripe with risks and opportunities, but how does it fit into portfolios? To help us distill the rapidly changing dynamics of investing in China, Rui Zhao, Portfolio Manager for Systematic Active Equity’s China strategies, and Philip Hodges, CIO of Factor-Based Strategies, give us a run-down of how to tap into the best opportunities in the Chinese markets and how systematic investing creates differentiated insights to seize those investment opportunities. What do you think makes China a great investment opportunity now? Philip Hodges: The opportunities that come from investing in onshore China can be distilled into several components. It’s the second-largest economy in the world with steep growth trajectory. The country is also shifting from exports to domestic consumption, with a big middle class to fuel that consumption. Additionally, China has been making heavy investments in technology, seeing a revolution in productivity, liberating financial markets, and opening up to foreign investors. The opportunity in China is big, and when most people think about onshore investments, they think A Shares. China’s A-share market consists of over 4,100 companies, and has a combined market capitalization of over US$16 trillion, making it one of the largest equity markets in the world.1 Similarly, China’s onshore bond market is roughly US$14 trillion, making it the second-largest bond market in the world.2 Despite the size of these markets, it is currently under-owned. Foreign investors hold just 3.5% of the broad market in China.3 China has shown great support for economic globalization and is already making strides to open its markets to the rest of the world. China’s economic circumstances present a potentially compelling opportunity, but current investment processes must evolve in order for investors to tap into this market. How did you choose to respond to the 2020 investment landscape? Also, as an investor in the Chinese markets, how will you continue to address the potential uncertainty from this drawn-out pandemic in the year ahead? Rui Zhao: China’s digital economy has been growing rapidly over the past few years and was especially accelerated during the pandemic, which has made more data available in just the past year alone. When China went into lockdown in January 2020 due to COVID-19, information about what companies were doing was very unknown. However, despite the uncertainty associated with COVID-19, investment decisions could benefit from many years of data accumulation. Relying on alternative data helps answer basic investor questions such as, “Which companies or industries will benefit the most from the pandemic?” and “Which companies are having their workers return to work, and when will those companies start producing again?” Systematic research methods were key to understanding China’s investment landscape because it allowed us to deeply understand the evolution of company fundamentals during an unprecedented time. Onboarding more types of data and developing better machine learning models for analysis have always been our research focus. This has also allowed us to make more informed decisions about a company’s future growth, the quality of management, as well as a company’s ESG profile. Can you comment on overall volumes and changes in market participants? Rui Zhao: We have seen an increase in market turnover throughout the past year. This can be attributed to both domestic retail and institutional investors, as well as global investors. As of today, the Stock Connect Northbound flow which refers to Chinese mainland-listed stocks traded on the Hong Kong Stock exchange – has reached 2.1 trillion RMB, which is more than US$300 billion. After a decade of investor education, domestic funds are finally becoming attractive among retail investors, and we’ve also seen the total number of ETFs holdings double over the past two years. This can be a sign that more retail investors are starting to increase their trust in professionals to manage their assets, rather than making those investment decisions themselves. In 2020, growth seemed to have a tight linear relationship with active return. How do you think this played out in China and how did China Opportunities respond? Rui Zhao: Over the past year, we have seen the market become more concentrated. For example, when we look at exposures, we see it centered around high growth and high volatility stocks. These factor exposures are approaching a historically high level, which happened twice in the past; once in 2008 and again in 2015. We’re not saying that the market is crashing any time soon, but it’s important to note that the level of concentration has been quite extreme. In this environment, we believe that our diversified risk control strategy will really help our clients diversify away from some of the idiosyncratic risk. Briefly, what does correlation look like among China macro factors? Additionally, what does that do to a portfolio? Philip Hodges: In terms of diversification, we saw very low negative correlations in many places across most Chinese assets. We’re used to seeing lower negative correlations in the developed market between equities and bonds, but we don’t always see that in emerging markets. We definitely see that in China. Chinese government bonds are a flight to quality assets that perform well to hedge equity risk. In credit, the situation is even rosier. Chinese corporates have a low to negative correlation both with government bonds and equities. And this is true even if you strip out the interest rate component and just look at credit spreads. In developed markets, we’re used to pretty high correlations between credit spreads and equity markets. That level of diversification still exists in the Chinese market. Given these low correlations, it’s perhaps not surprising that a diversified multi-asset China portfolio is a good way to steadily accrue risk premia and benefit from Chinese growth.

Beyond the world of equities, how does adding other asset classes into the investment mix change risk profiles and overall return potential? Philip Hodges: There are other asset classes that diversify risk premia not just to Chinese equities, but to other traditional exposures that you may have in your portfolio. China’s bond market, for example, has more than 90% of it held domestically.4 Those interest rate exposures tend to offer much higher premia than in developed market equivalents. In the corporate bond space, risk-adjusted yield and income tend to be higher than developed market equivalents as well. If you look at the world global bonds that are yielding more than 2.5%, over 50% of those are onshore Chinese bonds.5 Additionally, we did some work looking at commodity investments and constructible indices, showing that if you tilt towards commodities that are most heavily consumed by China, they tend to offer a higher premium, outperforming in-line with Chinese growth. Chinese equities have experienced quite a lot of volatility, but diversified portfolios tend to move more in line and more consistently with Chinese growth. If we drill into some of the biggest peaks and draw-downs in the equity markets, in 2008, MSCI China A was down 64%. Over the same period, a levered multi-asset portfolio with 100% allocation to rates (5Y China Interest Rate swap), 50% allocation to credit (China Bond 3-5Y IG Credit total return index) and 25% allocation to equity (MSCI China A) would have been up around 1% in 2008.6 So, we see plenty of opportunities for a multi-asset approach in China as diversified risk premia in different asset classes in a balanced portfolio tend to offer pretty good diversifying returns against traditional global investment.

       "  'description': 'Our research shows that impact investing in public equities can help yield outperformance and provide a differentiated source of alpha versus global equities. We extend the concept of breadth and illustrate how impact investments can enhance a portfolio’s structure through diversification.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Overview Our research shows that impact investing in public equities can help accomplish two crucial investment objectives: generate financial outperformance and provide a differentiated source of alpha versus global equities. Inspired by the foundational framework in Grinold and Kahn’s “Fundamental Law of Active Management,”1 we extend the concept of breadth to analyze the opportunity for alpha in impact investing in public equities. We also illustrate how impact investments can work to enhance a whole portfolio’s structure by improving diversification, increasing the potential for financial performance while mitigating risk. What is the impact universe? The impact universe is made up of companies whose core products or services help solve the world’s great social and environmental challenges. Consisting of approximately 600 publicly traded companies as of March 31, 2020, the universe has been built by BlackRock based on proprietary, fundamental research. To qualify for the universe, companies must meet the criteria of “materiality” and “additionality.” The materiality requirement insists that greater than 50% of a company’s revenues or business activity must come from products or services helping to solve major social or environmental problems (such as those represented by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets2). Additionality requires that a company’s products or services must address a need that is unlikely to be fulfilled by others (such as competitors or governments). Applying the concept of “breadth” Differentiated market inefficiencies in public equities impact investing reflect breadth and the potential opportunity for capturing alpha. Impact companies have higher standard deviation of returns versus global equities, leading to a wider set of risks and opportunities that can be exploited in seeking to generate alpha. Impact companies demonstrate a higher and more frequent dispersion of returns versus global equities, representing another market inefficiency (see chart below). Next, impact companies have lower coverage by sell-side analysts, which we see as an opportunity.3 Notably, the impact opportunity set has low overlap in names with major indices, adding to breadth and the opportunity to generate alpha.4 Finally, impact companies cannot be systematically identified5, and therefore are often misclassified or misunderstood, offering significant opportunity. Rolling 12-month standard deviation of daily returns Five-year ending March 2020 Source: BlackRock, with data from Bloomberg ending March 2020. Defined as average standard deviation of daily returns trailing 12 months across underlying holdings (BlackRock’s proprietary Impact Universe and MSCI Indices); 5-year period ending March 2020. Indices are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Complementary roles in a portfolio asset allocation structure Impact investing in public equities has characteristics that can serve important roles in a portfolio’s strategic asset allocation structure. Investing in impact companies provides exposure to structural growth. Additionally, with lower valuations across standard equity metrics such as Price/Earnings, Price/Cash Flow, and more, many companies in our impact universe are less expensive than global equities.6 As previously noted, because impact companies are (i) more neglected by analysts, (ii) have low overlap in names compared to traditional equity indices, (iii) are often misclassified by industry frameworks, (iv) cannot be identified by systematic screening and (v) have business models that can be driven by megatrends, impact companies can offer exposure to these segments of the market and enhance portfolio diversification. In a portfolio that already has private market impact investments, public equities impact investing provides exposure to companies that are typically at a different stage of growth in their business lifecycle as they scale their business models. Finally, impact investing in public equities serves as a complement to other sustainability vehicles. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Overview Two powerful trends are converging - companies are increasingly realizing the potential of private financing arrangements, while global investors are looking to put capital to work in Chinese markets. Mark Everitt, Head of Investment Research and Strategy for Blackrock Alternative Investors, recently led a discussion on the trends, challenges and opportunities in Chinese private markets, with a particular focus on the credit and real estate markets. We present highlights below. Participants were Connie Peng, Head of China, Global Real Estate; Celia Yan, Head of China and Co-portfolio manager of the Asia Pacific Private Credit; Mike Dennis, Head of Alternative Strategy and Capital Markets for Asia-Pacific; and Jim Barry, CIO of BlackRock Alternatives. How have Chinese private markets evolved? When looking at the future of Chinese private markets one of the most important themes is going to be the evolution of a bipolar world, with China on one side and the U.S. on the other. China is now pivotal to all our thinking. It’s too big of a market environment to ignore. Especially with COVID, where China was the first major world economy to return to growth, we’ve all been looking there to see what lies ahead for the rest of us. Despite this growth, many non-Chinese investors are still underexposed to the country’s financial markets. However, the changes over the past decades have been transformational. The equity market in Hong Kong is now four times the size of the London Stock Exchange and 60% the size of the New York Stock Exchange. The average daily turnover on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange recently stood at about US$25 billion, up from US$10 billion a year before. China has the second-most unicorns (privately held startup company valued at over US$1 billion) in the world.1 First, structural reform. Many of us are used to thinking of China as having high legal jurisdiction risk and restrictive capital controls. But the Chinese government has been improving insolvency, credit protection frameworks, transparency and its restructuring regime. For example, a new bankruptcy law allows bankrupt companies up to nine months of restructuring. And we’ve seen some defaults by state-owned enterprises, or SOEs, which have historically had access to capital based partly on political considerations. These developments pave the way for more efficient allocation of financial resources, and as such, global managers can now establish local businesses to build onshore alternative investment capabilities to target rising demands. The second point relates to the breadth of opportunities. We’re seeing a healthier and deeper market. Private market activity traditionally was heavily skewed toward domestic investors, but now there is a real desire to partner with international expertise as the country builds deeper and more robust markets. In the past, banks have dominated this market. But as regulators push the country toward a less bank-centric system, we’re seeing a greater understanding in corporate China of how companies can work with flexible private financing throughout the capital structure to achieve their goals. Private credit has room to grow Percentage of credit to corporates from non-bank channels Source: Bank of International Settlements. Accurate as of 30 September 2020. What are some trends in Chinese private credit and real estate? There are currently four top trends in private credit: Demand for financing is exceeding supply; there are more opportunities for growth financing; private credit has been resilient; and credit managers and companies increasingly are working as partners. Chinese banks tend to overlook small to mid-sized companies, but their need for financing still exists and is increasing. Corporations’ growing understanding of their private credit options is helping produce continuous demand. As a result, we’re seeing a scalable opportunity with a very attractive risk-adjusted return premium. The second trend is opportunities in growth sectors like technd media. Private lending in China has always focused on sectors like distressed and asset-backed financing. As the service sector has grown, we’re able to fill the financing gap for those companies as well. Third, credit proved its resilience in China through COVID-19. Private credit performance has been relatively stable, with low correlations to other markets. It has outperformed not just on return but also on risk, which we think are very important for investors facing uncertainties from both COVID and politics. Fourth, the market is shifting to a more proactive approach to sourcing and lending. Credit managers now can work as lending partners to companies and helping generate post-investment value, bringing business expertise and sometimes a “stamp of approval” to the relationship in addition to just financing. In real estate, with COVID-19 under control in China we expect volumes to start to recover in 2021, particularly in the office and logistics sectors. Our view is that the impact of COVID-19 on China’s office sector will be short-term and limited. People started to return to work in April last year, and by May, occupancy was back to pre-COVID levels. While some sectors have been massively impacted by COVID, other sectors benefit from the new normal, such as online education and IT. And as China further opens its financial sector, this is an exciting market to diversify into. Considering all these factors, the impact of COVID-19 on office buildings in China should be relatively short-term. We also are interested in logistics, which is vibrant in China as it is elsewhere. As the pandemic accelerated ecommerce, it provided strong fundamentals for investing in this sector. What are the main positives and challenges you see? We should expect some market volatility in the near term as the government tries to improve market practices. This is good news for us because the market shocks from policy changes will create some funding gaps that we can address as private credit lenders. We also see continued demand for capital, for growth financing and for distressed and turnaround financing. Now, we have access to a diversified base of financing opportunities to scale across different market cycles and regions. At the same time, transparency in China is improving, especially for data verification. For example, with the development of mobile payments, it’s a lot easier to verify sales and cash flows. We also see the governance and transparency improvements reflected in the growing market share of the big four accounting firms and the international consulting firms. Reforms and greater transparency help address some of the challenges in Chinese private credit, but we can’t mitigate all of the risk. Therefore, we need to make sure we have enough return premium, structure deals in ways that provide downside protection, engage in extensive post-investment management and keep loan-to-values low to increase our margin of safety. Another positive development is that the first REIT was launched last year, and as more REITs enter the market it is seen as improving the liquidity of Chinese real estate. Other developments are the increase in scale and the fact that foreign direct investment is still a very key objective for all levels of government. Considering these challenges, you have to be mindful that this is a big, complex market with its own dynamics, and there’s no substitute for deep local knowledge. The logistics market is a case point. The so-called tier one market has 26 cities, and each city has eight to nine submarkets. To understand the tier-one market, we need to study over 200 submarkets. Final thoughts Number one, we’re heading into an environment where China and the U.S. are increasingly becoming more separate ecosystems, and the Chinese government understands the need for international investors. Second, there’s a concern about long-term liquidity risk, but we don’t see it in the reality of owning private companies in China. For example, there’s been an explosion in IPOs both in Hong Kong and in the U.S. We believe if investors can separate the real risk from the perceived risk, then they may stand to benefit from looking at the private market opportunities across China.

Growth equity opportunity Until quite recently, growth equity was a nascent area of the private equity market where technology companies were bootstrapped prior to IPO. Today, the growth equity market has matured to USD 113 billion of deal activity last year, up from USD 24 billion in 2010 (see chart below). In years past, it was exceedingly rare for companies to achieve a USD 1 billion valuation without access to public capital (hence the name “unicorn” to describe the statistical rarity). Today there are close to 500 companies boasting this status, turning their once mythical status into a more common sighting.1 U.S. private markets growth equity activity Growth equity market has matured to USD 113 billion of deal activity Source: Pitchbook, 2021 Annual U.S. PE Breakdown. Above information represents private equity growth equity investment from 2010 to 2021 in the United States. Data-driven approach If growth equity companies are staying private longer, it may be no surprise that private and public company data footprints are increasingly similar. While private companies have the luxury of forgoing the formal data disclosures required of publicly traded companies, digital footprints are not obscured by the difference in capital markets construct. Reimagined portfolios The ability to recognize and source new investment opportunities is arguably the most important function of the growth equity investment process. Historically, sourcing the attractive deals has been relationship-based. Today, data science techniques have raised the bar, allowing pioneering managers to look beyond their network and proactively detect attractive company characteristics using predictive models. Systematic models offer scalability, enhanced efficiency and improved portfolio outcomes by evaluating a universe of thousands of securities. A systematic approach offers investors the opportunity to uncover opportunities that traditional methods and models may have overlooked, with a faster view and with a higher degree of certainty.

Pricing pressures abound Global prices for everything from oil and gasoline to cereal and milk are significantly higher this year, escalating pressure on consumers and companies alike. Median global inflation is nearly 8% vs. approximately 3% a year ago1, and the high absolute level of inflation will have lasting effects. High and persistent inflation can become more difficult to eliminate outside of a recession, and those risks are important to assessing credit fundamentals. No longer a rising tide Regime change is difficult to quantify, especially when it is occurring in real time. And yet the shift in monetary policy of both higher interest rates, an end to asset purchases, and in particular a reduction to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet highlight a significant policy shift in response to the highest inflation levels experienced in 40 years. A variable but persistent tailwind of the last many years which has come to an end, and now we’ll see what businesses are truly ready to withstand tightening financial conditions. Winners and losers As companies react to higher input and financing costs, the idiosyncrasies of individual business models begins to diverge. At a time of slowing economic growth, the risks and opportunities can be more pronounced, and offer greater alpha potential to those able to navigate them. Navigating greater uncertainty A wider distribution of outcomes is a function of more uncertainty. We view a wide lens as critical to understanding the range of market opportunities today, while selectivity remains critical to positioning us to be able to create differentiated outcomes. '},\n",

       "  'content': \" Setting the scene The world’s hunt for income and yield has been an issue for decades that will likely continue. People are living longer and retiring in record numbers, while Covid-19 triggered a race to near- zero interest rates in developed countries. The U.S. currently has US$17+ trillion worth of bonds with negative yields, which is roughly the size of the entire Chinese bond market, where most bonds yield more than 2.5% are found (see chart below). We believe the recent strong net inflows validates the attractiveness of Chinese fixed income markets and are indicative of future flows. Global investors have historically shied away from owning Chinese assets citing a lack of market sophistication and limits on ability to access the onshore markets. Portfolios have traditionally held very small quantities of Chinese assets via aggregate emerging market (EM) exposures. This is changing rapidly. Recent inflows reflect the larger Chinese representation in international indices, but also growing recognition that Chinese markets are entering a more mature phase well-positioned to help the global investor. A few catalysts are: Global bonds yielding more than 2.5% by market Source: BlackRock, Wind, December 2020. Based on the Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse and all eligible China onshore bonds - both rates and credit bonds (>1billion CNY size, >1 year maturity). DM and EM stand for developed and emerging markets, respectively. Does index inclusion help open up Chinese bonds to foreign investors? China has the world's second- largest bond and credit markets after the U.S. Inbound flows have indeed accelerated due to inclusion in global indices, but credit bonds aren’t in this scope, leaving out a large portion of the investable universe where attractive opportunities lie. The Chinese bond market is about US$17 trillion1, surpassed only by the US$49 trillion2 market. Index inclusion has eased Chinese bonds into asset allocation considerations, while offering a fairer representation in international indices. In December 2020, Chinese bonds accounted for about 6% of the Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse Index, the broadest measure for global fixed income. However, credit bonds, a significant part of the investable universe aren’t part of the inclusion (see the Two bond types chart). This is important because investors that are benchmark constrained or aware, may not benefit from the potential alpha generation that credit offers (assuming investors can navigate certain complexities of Chinese credit markets). State-owned enterprises (SOEs) represent over a quarter of China’s onshore credit market (see chart). The SOEs’ significance varies widely between central and local governments and understanding their relative rank may prove as crucial to understanding the issuer’s standalone fundamentals to determine its creditworthiness. The different methodologies used by domestic and international credit rating agencies create another set of complexities. Understanding these differences is critical to assessing ratings fairly, especially since domestic agencies dominate in this market. Two bond types Composition of China’s onshore bond market, 2020 Source: Wind, December 2020. Policy bank bonds are owned by the central government and serve policy function; local government bonds are offered by the provinces. What are the diversification benefits of Chinese bonds? Chinese bonds can offer portfolio ballast, attractive yield and diversification based on the onshore and offshore nature of the market.3 Drivers of uncorrelated returns The Chinese bond market can go beyond addressing the need for yield in the post-Covid-19 world. The ‘More than a yield pick up’ chart alludes to potential benefits from diversifying into China’s credit - higher yields and income per unit of risk to the equivalent U.S. bonds, even unhedged. This compliments the dual diversification potential of the low correlations between China and other major bond markets and among the onshore RMB and offshore USD Chinese credit markets – highlighted in the Alpha opportunity through tactical allocation chart. In China, yields from the same issuer may differ across markets, enabling managers to exploit such differentials for alpha generation, while taking similar credit risks. Risk-free rates vary by market. Onshore credits are RMB-denominated and sensitive to Chinese monetary conditions and other onshore-market factors. Most offshore credits are U.S.-dollar denominated, subject to global risk factors. More than a yield pick up U.S. corporate yield and various credit yields in China, 2020 Source: Bloomberg.

Even though we may see an increase in Chinese credit defaults this year, we do not see it as a systemic risk. China’s willingness to make financial reforms quickly, can have a meaningful impact on credit quality and transparency. We see a potential uptick in Chinese credit defaults this year, but not enough to pose systemic risks to the onshore bond market. China’s default rate significantly lags that of its global counterparts, despite pandemic-related stresses. For example, annual defaults in U.S. high yield nearly doubled last year, and while reversion to pre-Covid-19 levels is plausible, in 2021 U.S. defaults may top China’s by nearly a two-to-one ratio (see the Staying in business chart). Stories about the rising risks of Chinese defaults have grabbed attention from many global investors, masking what in our view should be their main concern: the sustainability of returns. The speed and efficacy at which China can forge its financial markets’ reforms should have more meaningful and lasting effects than any isolated event. Defaults are part of the story; they just aren’t the main part. The initial wave of defaults preceded the escalation of the U.S. China trade tensions in 2018, which cut short the government’s deleveraging effort, as further aggravated in Q1 2020 by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, China’s V-shaped economic recovery facilitates a return to the deleveraging path. We see this gaining force by this year’s second half, along with tightening to prevent overheating, especially in the hot property sector. This scenario fits well within a bigger picture. Chinese regulators have long sought to raise the financial market transparency and support paths toward maturity in the credit cycle (e.g. deleveraging and removing the moral hazard of implicit guarantees for local SOEs). The market is now poised to further differentiate credits and improve pricing, which are positive signs for investors.

       "  'content': ' An evolving opportunity set While the pandemic disrupted certain sectors of the real assets market, it also accelerated some major secular trends that are driving increased investment appetite across several key areas. This challenges investors to rethink traditional portfolio construction and uncover new ways to optimize flexibility. We see the diversity of real asset tools as an underutilized advantage that will be key to outperformance going forward. Leveraging diversity In much of the world, a powerful economic restart is officially underway. However, dislocations will likely continue as global markets forge ahead in a multi-speed, regionalized recovery. These dynamics present both challenges and opportunities for real asset investors around how to identify secular growth themes, capitalize on structural trends and build resilience while aligning with long-term investment objectives. It’s our view that expanding the traditional real asset toolkit will be key to successfully navigating these complexities and generating more meaningful alpha. By assessing the wide range of real asset options—from debt and equity to listed, primary, secondary and direct access—investors can exploit the dichotomy between stable core, value-add and opportunistic assets to customize portfolios in line with their particular investment objectives. Each asset class, we believe, plays a role in both portfolio construction and the specific type of exposure it offers to broader investment themes. Whether an investor is looking to pursue higher income portfolios with cash flow generating assets, take on more construction or contractual risk with higher capital gain potential, or some combination of both, the versatility of real asset strategies is a particularly attractive characteristic in a post-pandemic marketplace.

       "  'content': ' Accelerating evolution Investing in today’s credit markets is a quest for yield in a rapidly changing landscape. Spreads in liquid markets are at historic tights amid unprecedented central bank support for corporate credit. Industries and business models face disruption from digitization, deglobalization and decarbonization. Sustainability is increasingly important, but not always easy to achieve or measure. The deepening of private credit and the growth of SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) signal shifts in the symbiosis of public and private markets. The years following the global financial crisis were transformative ones for today’s credit markets. We think the years ahead will prove equally consequential, as some trends from the prior period speed up and newer trends take hold. Global growth: the sequel Global high yield issuance was a record US$222 billion in the first quarter of 2021, according to BlackRock Capital Markets, on a path to surpass 2020’s record-breaking tally of US$617 billion.1 Private credit is also seeing a major influx of capital, with AUM of US$975 billion as of September 2020, according to Preqin.2 This continues the expansion of the post-GFC years, which was significant but far more gradual. Looking ahead, the highest growth rates are likely to be in all types of credit outside the US and within private credit globally. This would continue the trends of the past decade—notably, markets stepping in to lend as banks pull back for regulatory reasons. But there are some key, post-pandemic differences. The leading country in the future global expansion is sure to be China, where relying less on banks and more on markets is a policy priority and the market is potentially as large as North America’s and Europe’s combined. As for private credit, 2020 was a stress test for this still-young asset class, and it passed comfortably. The potential for resilience as well as a yield pickup over traded credit are likely to enhance its appeal to investors. Significant expansion Global high yield issuance (left) and private credit demand (right) Sources: BlackRock Capital Markets, March 2021; Preqin, September 2020. Financing change The pandemic has sorted companies into haves and have-nots, depending on their industry, size and business model. We look for credit markets to serve the entire spectrum. Central bank support has prevented the wave of defaults many expected lockdowns would generate. In April Fitch Ratings lowered its leveraged loan default rate forecast for 2021 to 2.5%, far below the 14% rate seen in 2009.3 However, Fitch also forecast a slightly higher rate of up to 3.5% in 2022, and this is significant.4 For every company that actually defaults, many more face operational or balance sheet problems that are significant but solvable. Looking ahead we expect to see many companies in the latter category, even amid economic growth and easy financial conditions. Often, the reason will be some combination of leverage and a need to adapt to one or more of the powerful changes the pandemic has accelerated. A retailer needing to build out e-tailing capacity or a manufacturer re-engineering its supply chain are cases in point. Credit, particularly private credit, plays a growing role in financing this type of transformation. Meanwhile, amid growing economic optimism, credit markets are ramping up their traditional role of financing M&A, as indicated in the chart below, which shows private middle market loans used for the purpose. Acquisitions accelerate Quarterly middle-market sponsored M&A issuance Source: Refinitiv, March 2021. Innovation and integration As credit markets expanded over the past decade, the different segments focused on different kinds of issuers. High yield became a market serving larger companies able to meet the standards of an investor base that has grown more institutional over time. Smaller issuers with more complex stories increasingly looked to the private credit markets for financing. In today’s growing economy, there is a widening gap between commercial bank financing at one end of the spectrum and the syndicated leverage finance market at the other, providing further opportunities for private credit. And while this trend started in the US, it is now accelerating in Europe and Asia. Where segmentation of the overall market was a theme in the last decade, we expect integration to be a hallmark of the next one. As private debt managers have attracted more capital, direct lenders have taken on increasingly large transactions, with Preqin counting six deals over US$1 billion in 2020.5 Given the available scale, some issuers that could access syndicated markets are opting for private debt (paying a premium for certainty of execution and/or discretion) or using both. We also see mutual benefits for companies and capital providers in a life-cycle approach to credit provision. Companies needing a venture loan to fund growth, or a bespoke solution to a financing challenge, will (if all goes well) often go on to tap liquid markets. Conversely, a high yield issuer with a financing challenge may turn to private markets for a solution. '},\n",

       "  'description': 'The pandemic has hit each country in unique ways. Understanding the local and global investment implications takes deep, country-by-country analysis.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Overview A single narrative has come to dominate the market outlook. It holds that the combination of vaccine distribution, government stimulus and pent-up demand will power a burst of economic growth later this year, potentially boosting inflation and broadening corporate profit growth. Markets have rallied strongly on this belief. Investors may assume that this narrative applies globally—but that assumption is flawed. Country-by-country analysis of emerging markets makes clear that on the whole they have experienced Covid-19 very differently than developed markets, and that the experiences of individual countries within the EM complex have varied widely. Particular countries’ distinct situations lead to divergent outlooks for capital markets around the globe. This environment demands thorough understanding of each market’s individual situation and dynamics. Covid hit the developed world hardest Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, conventional wisdom expected the disease to be far more destructive in emerging markets than developed markets. That forecast was wrong. “While the coronavirus has been painful in poor and middle-income countries, it’s been significantly less painful than we would have expected,” notes Belinda Boa, BlackRock’s Head of Active Investments for Asia-Pacific and CIO of Emerging Markets in BlackRock’s Fundamental Active Equity Business. Certain EM countries kept infection rates low by implementing strong track-and-trace systems and/or quickly closing borders—particularly China, Korea and Taiwan, which make up two-thirds of EM market capitalization.1 The three countries had just 36,467 confirmed new cases of Covid-19 during the first 68 days of 2021, compared to 8.88 million for the United States2. Overall, developed markets had roughly five million more confirmed cases than emerging markets through late February3, despite much smaller total populations. But the more surprising and consequential difference is an enormous gap in mortality rates, which are far lower in the emerging world (see the chart below)—even among countries with severe outbreaks, such as India and Indonesia. Research suggests the discrepancy can’t be explained away as a product of better reporting in developed countries4. Why have poorer countries withstood the pandemic so much better than their wealthy counterparts? Researchers aren’t sure, but the explanation could lie in a combination of factors such as demographics, climate, lower comorbidities and experience with previous outbreaks. Covid mortality much lower in emerging markets Source: Johns Hopkins Uni CSSE and BlackRock, February 22, 2021. Many pandemic endgames Vaccines look likely to end the pandemic in the developed world this year. That isn’t the case in many emerging markets, which have less access to vaccines—particularly those most effective against new strains—and less infrastructure to roll them out. All of the willing US population is likely to be vaccinated by year-end 2021, compared to 34% in the EU and just 11% in emerging markets5. At the same time, political and economic considerations may prevent the imposition of additional lockdowns in many countries. Cumulative COVID-19 vaccination doses administered per 100 people Source: Official data collected by Our World in Data - Last updated March 10, 2021. EM countries could have a range of Covid endgames. Some may be able to inoculate their way out of the pandemic; many others may need to allow the virus to spread in order to reach herd immunity. In emerging markets broadly, the coronavirus could continue to interfere with life for additional months or years—but the degree will vary considerably from country to country. “I think we will see very diverse results across the emerging-markets complex both in terms of the efficacy of the rollout and the speed with which it happens,” says Boa. Investment implications Emerging and developed markets alike seem to be priced for an end to the pandemic later this year. We believe that approach is warranted in certain emerging markets but may not be in others. We believe the EM countries that were first to experience second waves and new variants are closest to the end of the pandemic. These include South Africa, where the seven-day average of confirmed new cases fell from 321 per million people in early January to fewer than 19 as of March 9, despite the emergence of more-contagious strains6. We expect similar developments in Brazil, where new cases per million people currently are roughly the same as South Africa’s were at its peak7. In our view, investors in other countries may be too complacent about the risk that new waves of Covid could restrict economic activity. For example, asset prices in India suggest investors think the country has reached herd immunity. We believe that might not be the case. If the country does not have herd immunity, it faces the possibility of a second wave that could destabilize its markets in the short term. Likewise, China has led the global recovery to this point. It was the only major economy with positive 2020 GDP growth8, and has seen key economic indicators recover to pre-Covid levels9. Risks remain, however. The country’s low rate of infection may have limited the development of natural immunity to the coronavirus generally and to new variants in particular. Meanwhile, China has been exporting vaccines rather than deploying them within its own population. Although this practice may be changing, as of the end of February the country had inoculated only 3.65% of its people with at least a single vaccine dose, compared to nearly 23% for the United States10. Although China may benefit from a global economic recovery, its sensitivity to a second wave could prevent the country from fully reopening its borders until 2022. Individual countries’ situations are evolving rapidly. Investors need to understand the Covid trajectory in each and be prepared to adapt. Thorough research in each market is essential for investors to understand the different experiences and outlooks around the world, and to allocate portfolios accordingly. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Overview To holistically support an impact enterprise’s enduring success, we believe impact investing in public equities should be built on three interconnected pillars: additionality through the investor’s contribution; additionality through the investee (the company); and additionality through the asset class. Definition of impact investing Impact investments are investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return. The practice of impact investing is further defined by core characteristics: intentionality; use of evidence and impact data in investment design; management of impact performance; contribution to the growth of the industry. Contribution from the investor Impact investors, with their natural long-term horizon, can afford an impact company the benefit of focusing on its long-term goals. Additionally, impact investors offer a more responsible exit from private investment for impact companies through patient capital and a long-term partnership. Furthermore, investors can create impact by participating in capital raises which provide additionality to the impact company. Finally, investors can engage with companies on impact progress, and increase attention to often overlooked impact enterprises. Contribution from the company A business qualifies as impact only if it meets the criteria of materiality and additionality. We typically define materiality as having greater than 50% of a company’s revenues from products and services helping to solve a major social or environmental problem. To meet the additionality criterion, a company’s products or services must address a need that is unlikely to be fulfilled by others (such as competitors or governments). Contribution at the asset class level Quite simply, the global need for impact capital is an order of magnitude greater than what could conceivably be provided by the private markets. For developing markets alone, we face a shortfall of approximately US$2.5 trillion annually to meet the SDGs by 2030.1 Given the magnitude of the need and the extraordinary opportunity, we must find ways for public markets to scale impact investing with integrity. By offering impact investing through public equities, a broad new cohort of investors can participate and provide much needed capital. '},\n",

As part of the new behaviors basket, we have seen consumption habits gradually and partially revert to more normal levels, as illustrated in the chart below.

       "  'content': ' More than meets the eye Just over a year into the pandemic, market conditions and credit valuations have improved significantly. A 20% selloff as lockdowns began soon reversed and credit markets have gone on to rally over 34% since the low point in March 2020, based on the Bloomberg Barclays US High Yield Index. Roughly US$ 4 trillion of global corporate debt was issued in 2020, per BlackRock Capital Markets, and private debt funds closed on US $118 billion during 2020, according to Preqin. Behind the headline numbers, however, a more complex story is unfolding as long-running market trends intersect with Covid’s economic consequences. In the decade before the crisis, the segments of the credit markets—private, public, high yield, investment grade—grew deeper and more specialized as well as more integrated. Issuers could increasingly seek out capital on terms aligned with their needs, while investors gained more choices in risk and return profiles. Now the pandemic’s uneven impact across industries is creating a greater demand for non-traditional forms of financing on the private side of the spectrum. Beyond dispersion As the chart below reminds us, there has been a sharp dispersion between industry sectors hit hardest by Covid and those benefiting from it. For some companies, the parts of the credit spectrum available to them have changed, or the terms and prices in familiar segments have grown less attractive. Companies in leisure and travel have done sizable high-yield issues, but at generous spreads. Meanwhile, some issuers that could access the traded markets may opt instead for the scale and flexibility of the capital now available from direct lenders in private markets, or tap both public and private markets at the same time. Growth companies can continue to take advantage of private debt financing to stay private for longer. And companies facing turnaround situations or other complex challenges can partner with a specialized credit provider on a bespoke solution.

Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Future credit needs While credit markets will likely see a robust economy and strong demand from yield-hungry investors, some issuers may still face challenges. A recovery that is V-shaped for some could be L-shaped for those in sectors hit hardest by the pandemic. Additional hurdles may include the need to redesign and right-size business models, and to implement shorter and more resilient supply chains. Heightened leverage levels could be a constraint. Among companies in the S&P LSTA leveraged loan index, for example, leverage went from under five times earnings at year-end 2018 to more than six times at year-end 2020, according to S&P LCD. We expect plenty of activity across the credit spectrum this year, with private markets taking on a growing number of complex financing challenges. Original work, industry knowledge—and partnership To invest well in one part of the credit spectrum, we believe it’s important to be active in all of them. For one thing, companies tap different parts of the market as they evolve. Today’s direct lending borrower may be tomorrow’s high-yield issuer, and yesterday’s high-yield issuer may be tomorrow’s bespoke-solution seeker, looking to repair the damage inflicted by the pandemic. Knowing the industries and the companies that comprise them, and interacting with the companies over time and changing circumstances, builds confidence and trust. The more bespoke the credit, the deeper the company-level due diligence needs to be, and the more important it is to reflect the diligence in how the credit is structured. Complexity is an opportunity, but it requires original work and a willingness to dive deep in order to identify the diamonds in the rough. '},\n",

We saw support at the long-end of the Treasury curve amidst last Thursday’s selloff. Last week, the back-end of the Treasury curve outperformed the short-end as we believe investors sought to satisfy pent up de-risking needs.3 Insurance buyers were also active this week, likely taking advantage of higher yields. We suspect this long-end institutional demand will persist over the near term. Nuances in supply and demand, liquidity and transaction costs have been increasingly prevalent in Treasury and credit markets. Prior to trading, we encourage discussion, where possible, with a BlackRock relationship manager to evaluate market opportunities and de-risking considerations. We believe the question on many investors’ minds right now is if and when the Fed will step in to provide further market support. While a possibility, we believe the rise in rates would have to begin to constrain the flow of credit to the real economy, which it does not appear to have. As we will discuss in more detail in our soon to be released Corporate Pension Themes, even in the face of rising rates, gains in funded status should continue to support allocations to long duration assets.

       "  'content': ' 2021 healthcare review The global healthcare sector (represented by the Russell 3000 HealthCare Index) returned +19.8% in 2021, highlighting positive growth in the context of a volatile equity market. However, not all industries and companies were created equal. This year brought significantly higher dispersion of returns between various industries, as well as different market capitalization segments, with the clear winners being COVID-19 beneficiaries. Overall, areas more sensitive to impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, including medtech elective procedures, next generation service providers and telemedicine companies experienced heightened volatility and weaker returns during the period. In addition, broad market uncertainty led to a flight to safety away from risky assets and in favor of large, quality companies. Healthcare companies with market caps below $10billion delivered on average negative returns in 2021. Life sciences companies, primarily providing technological tools and software for increased efficiency as well as research services, were strong winners during the year. The industry benefited from increased technological adoption and heightened demand for clinical services. In the healthcare providers space, hospitals and lab testing companies experienced strong returns, largely due to increased demand as a result of COVID-19. The managed care industry, primarily composed of large, U.S.-based insurance providers, experienced positive momentum on the back of the quality and value factor market rotation. Elsewhere in the industry, home health companies and value-based primary care providers experienced significant drawdowns during the year. The companies were negatively impacted by increased COVID-related costs, lower than anticipated adoption and the growth-to-value rotation that affected many 2020 strong stock performers. Returns within the pharmaceuticals sector were strong but concentrated, with three companies, Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson, driving about 91% of the returns this year in the Russell 3000 HealthCare Index. Both Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson benefited from the FDA emergency approval and subsequent deployment of their COVID-19 vaccines. Eli Lilly soared on the strength of their COVID-19 antibody treatment as well as an anticipated upcoming approval of their Alzheimer’s drug. The medical devices and supplies space also experienced heightened dispersion during the year, with COVID-19 diagnostic and testing companies posting the strongest returns. Results amongst the elective procedure segment were largely mixed, with larger, diversified quality companies delivering solid growth. Companies developing hospital tools, medical supplies and remote monitoring devices also returned positively. The biotechnology industry experienced the greatest weakness during 2021, with the equal weighted S&P Select Biotechnology Index posting -20% returns. The industry experienced a sharp reversal from 2020 highs, likely driven by factor rotations in the market, as well as lackluster clinical progress outside of COVID-19 during the period. Stripping out COVID-19 vaccine developer Moderna, which returned a staggering 143% in 2021, left the industry with approximately flat returns during the period. A slowdown in M&A activity amidst increased regulatory scrutiny and clinical safety setbacks in areas like gene therapy have also contributed to dampening sentiment. Given the riskier characteristics of early stage biotechnology companies, market sentiment shifted out of favor for the industry, even in cases of positive clinical development. Overall, 2021 brought increased dispersion and volatility across the healthcare sector, creating pockets of opportunity for 2022. 2021 healthcare returns by industry weight & market cap Source: FactSet as of December 31st, 2021. Sub-sectors are constituents of the Russell 3000 HealthCare Index. 2022 outlook mRNA vaccines Vaccines that target the spike protein found on the novel coronavirus using genetically engineered mRNA were a new class of inoculations approved during 2021. These jabs, primarily developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, saw high efficacy rates and wide adoption in the U.S. and across the developed world. Praised not only for their impressive results but also for the velocity of development, scientists are looking to use the mRNA modality to approach infectious diseases in the future, including malaria, influenza, sexually-transmitted diseases and cancer. mRNA therapies are likely to see continued clinical development in oncology over the next few years, as scientists attempt to leverage the modality of training the human immune system to fight specific identifiers in order to target tumor and cancerous cells. The versatility of genetically engineered mRNA is likely to usher in a new wave of medical innovation over the next decade. Diagnostics In March 2020, the FDA granted emergency approval to the first ever CRISPR-applied product, a COVID-19 diagnostic test that revealed results in under an hour. A year later, dozens of different diagnostic solutions have been developed by leading medtech companies, among them Abbott Labs, Danaher, Becton Dickinson and Thermo Fisher. From 10-minute blood tests to at-home rapid antigen swabs, testing companies have continued to innovate in 2021, in order to provide increasingly efficient and accurate COVID-19 tests. We anticipate that demand for COVID-19 diagnostic tests is likely to persist in the near-term on the back of the emergence of new virus variants. Antiviral oral treatments The second half of 2021 brought a welcome advance in the fight against the pandemic: the development of efficacious antiviral oral treatments for COVID-19. First announced by Merck & Co and subsequently launched by Pfizer, these treatments have the potential to significantly reduce mortality in patients sick with the virus, helping prevent severe illness and keeping hospitalizations at a manageable rate. Originally developed in the early 2000’s to treat influenza, Merck’s molnupivarir faced regulatory scrutiny after announcing that the drug was not as efficacious as originally expected. In contrast, Pfizer’s Paxlovid, a protease inhibitor drug, was found to reduce the risk of hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients by 89%. Despite the incessant focus of the healthcare industry on addressing COVID-19, there is also significant scientific progress outside of the current pandemic. Oncology The field of cancer treatments continued to expand at a rapid pace in 2021, despite record low rates of utilization. Patient hesitation to visit hospitals during the pandemic has led to significantly lower rates of diagnoses, with early 2021 rates still 26-51% below pre-pandemic levels. The impact of these delayed detections will likely continue to play out in the years to come. From a development perspective, breakthroughs in immune modulation are leading to record-levels of efficacy, with 17 novel cancer treatments approved for use globally in 2020 (16 of these designated as orphan drugs for rare cancers). Innovative treatments continue to be concentrated in smaller-capped companies, with nearly 80% of early-stage pipelines and 66% of late-stage pipelines being developed by emerging biopharma companies.1 CAR T-Cell therapies, a revolutionary oncotherapy, continued to expand in 2021, with approved treatments currently targeting lymphoma and leukemia now becoming increasingly accessible in the U.S.. Alzheimer’s 2021 marked a milestone in the fight against Alzheimer’s with the FDA approval of Biogen and Eisai’s drug Aduhelm earlier this year. The drug and other biosimilars continue a controversial and volatile road ahead faced with regulatory scrutiny and hurdles in commercial adoption. Medtech Medical devices continue to see significant progress, with advancements ranging from portable MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machines, ACL (anterior cruciate ligament)-healing tools and Alzheimer’s blood-based diagnostics, among others. We are likely to see continued innovation in this space, from precision surgical tools and minimally-invasive procedures, to the growing trend of wearable tech and connected devices, like continuous glucose monitoring systems. Technology in healthcare Despite the innovation developed within the sector, there is still a long way to go in the use of technology to improve products and services. In particular, the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical trials, gene mapping and robotic-assisted surgery is increasing. We are also seeing AI and software innovations in electronic records, personalized insurance plans and next-gen healthcare provider services. Early adopters of AI tools in clinical development have cited the ability of machine learning algorithms to identify biomarkers and learn about new diseases 30% faster than human pathologists. Given the average go-to-market rate of 5-10 years for new drugs, experts are hopeful that technology like AI can speed up drug discovery and development. 2 1IQVIA Institute: Global Oncology Trends, June 2021 2 BioSpace, December 2021 Reference to the names of the companies mentioned is for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice or an investment recommendation of the companies. Despite dampening sentiment on China investments in 2021, we continue to view the country as a long-term growth opportunity in healthcare, particularly as the government invests in the development of an innovative domestic biopharma industry. On the back of continued regulatory uncertainty, we remain neutral on sentiment in the country today, with a preference in risk-managed opportunities, such as contract research organizations, that benefit from secular demand for clinical trials and services, which we believe are likely to see organic growth in the next few years. We maintain exposure to biopharma companies in select, high-conviction opportunities. Valuations today for the healthcare sector remain very attractive and well below the long-run average, with FY1 P/E ratios currently at a 20% discount to broad equity markets (represented by the Russell 3000 Index). Certain industries, such as biotechnology, appear particularly attractive, with a FY1 P/E discount of 51% versus broad equity markets. We remain selectively optimistic in this industry, particularly in the small- and mid-cap segment of the market, with a focus on innovative pipelines and strong product results.

       "  'content': ' View through the prism of our investment process Emerging market (EM) equities defied early gloom last year and ended with double -digit gains, outperforming developed markets1. The 2020 total return for the MSCI EM Index, 18.3% in U.S. dollars, reflected strong global fiscal and monetary supports, China’s economic rebound, vaccines signaling gradual improvements ahead and some optimism about an earnings recovery in EM. Download quarterly newsletter Market overview and outlook We are constructive on EM equities for several reasons: 1. Strong liquidity, easy financial conditions and high levels of disposable income underpin expectations for positive earnings growth (see chart below); 2. Covid-19 vaccines support the gradual resumption of normal economic activity; 3. the pandemic-related stimuli have been proportionally less taxing across most developing nations relative to developed peers; 4. the weaker U.S. dollar has helped EM economies attract foreign capital; and 5. recent flows into EM equities reinforce this view, which we see extending in 2021. Three signposts to watch Recovery. Large economies following China’s path can help lift the global economy. Market breadth. “Momentum” stocks that drove equity returns last year (high tech and healthcare) may lose appeal reflecting a shift in valuations and earnings expectations. Geopolitics. A possible broadening of U.S.-China tensions from trade to human rights issues, albeit the tone and tactics may be less contentious under the new leadership.

Download quarterly newsletter Focusing on what matters Covid-19 ushered in a new decade for the world and will be remembered for its disruption to lives and livelihoods, globally. But this pandemic should further be remembered for fast-tracking trends already underway in social attitudes towards working and learning (more remote access), spending (more online shopping/services) and investing (more emphasis on environmental, social and governance, ESG, issues). We believe these trends are here to stay and remain at the forefront of our minds as we apply the investment tools we’ve developed to help navigate current and future market environments. Last year’s volatility complicated equity investing, but other extremes required equally astute judgments. For example, the dichotomies between an expectation that emerging economies would be hardest hit versus the actual outcome, or the bifurcation of sector performance that benefited a limited group –growth-oriented, internet-related or new technology stocks –to the detriment of more established and visible sectors. These challenges enabled us to test our focus on data sciences, risk management and market composition as ways to refine our investment decision-making. We touch on each to illustrate how they played out last year, and why these areas will remain integral to our investment process. Data mining Popular belief suggested that Covid-19 should have hit developing economies disproportionally hard, but our data scientists monitoring the situation evidenced facts pointing in the opposite direction. Fatalities in developed countries, mostly in the western hemisphere, outpaced those in developing ones by about four times between March and September 2020, based on counts per one million people. What contributed to this relatively controlled outcome? China, South Korea and Taiwan became world champions at finding, testing and isolating people effectively. Many EM countries went for herd immunity strategies by default, with large populations contracting the virus, and have generally fared better than many developed countries despite having inferior healthcare systems. Our stock-picking methodology, based on analysing company fundamentals, has increasingly relied on data scientists within our team to corroborate or reject our investment theses. We’ll continue to adhere to this practice and enhance it over time. Download quarterly newsletter Risk management The momentum style dominated stock returns last year, with high tech and healthcare driving most indexes’ performance –see A widening gap graph. But stock prices can’t go up forever, and vaccines and the end of lockdowns will lead to normalcy and may expose certain valuation anomalies. To balance portfolio risk, we turned to our dedicated EM equity experts in BlackRock’s Risk and Quantitative Analysis group to understand risk exposures and identify what we considered an appropriate mix in seeking to add alpha over this turbulent year. We’ve held growth and momentum stocks while progressively shifting to sectors that should benefit from normalization: the unloved financials and leisure-related stocks that have drawn our attention lately due to low valuations and improved earnings prospects. In an increasingly sophisticated world, we regard the close relationship with our risk management experts as critical to understanding portfolio risks and cementing our foremost ambition of creating a sustained alpha for our clients.

The figures shown relate to past performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. Download quarterly newsletter Market composition The face of EM has changed dramatically since the 2008 global financial crisis, and more changes are brewing. China has effectively controlled the virus and managed a challenging period for its economy. Its share of world exports rose to about 14% last year, a new high thanks to global spending in technology and Covid-related protective equipment. But domestic consumption has risen steadily and played a large role in last year’s V-shaped recovery, adding more than 50% of China’s GDP and up from 2019 levels. Another salient change is the rise of internet giants that have drastically reshaped index composition and size. The changing face of EM graph compares the top 10 MSCI EM Index constituents recently and in late 2008. Alibaba, today’s largest, and Tencent, second largest in the index, were not even in the picture back then, and only two have remained in the top 10 —TSMC (Taiwan) and Samsung Electronics (South Korea). This fast-moving scene brings new challenges about index risks and concentration, but also potential opportunities. China’s rise as an investment destination seems inevitable, yet we don’t see any single country monopolizing performance and have continued to identify potentially rewarding opportunities in India, Mexico and elsewhere in EM. The internet giants are also facing headwinds from increasing regulatory pressures and more intense competition, which undermine their potential to keep growing at the same breakneck pace. Our focus on generating unique investment insight, aided by our data scientists and risk management experts will remain vital inputs for our decision-making. The changing face of EM MSCI EM Index’s top 10 holdings, 2008 and 2020 Source: UBS, BlackRock, November, 2020. 2008 data as of Oct. 31, 2008, and 2020 data as of Nov. 30, 2020. Reference to the company names mentioned in this communication is merely for explaining the investment strategy and should not be construed as investment advice or investment recommendation of that company. Portfolio positioning Industrial activity and discretionary consumer demand led China’s V-shaped economic recovery, and we believe the trajectory will remain healthy. However, the central bank has started tightening monetary policy, and the strong performance in the onshore and offshore equity markets suggest this is a time to be quite selective. We believe India’s economy will continue to recover and have a positive view on ASEAN countries –especially Indonesia, where we see an attractive entry point given the premium growth and yield this country can offer. In Latin America, we maintain our preference for Mexico over Brazil, although we have started to reduce our under-exposure to Brazil, which we consider a good source for cyclical exposures, with attractive valuations and very low ownership as incentives. Markets in EMEA remain interesting, as they should benefit from the large European fiscal stimulus directed primarily at infrastructure spending. This is feeding into significant stimulus in Eastern Europe, for the first time in years. In short, we believe global investors have an opportunity to expand into EM equities at good entry point given the attractive growth and yield relative to DMs, at a time valuations and ownership remain low.

       "  'content': ' Investors making long-term decisions in illiquid markets have much to consider as they begin 2021. Covid is intersecting with deep shifts in the economy and society, driving changes that span asset classes and reach well into the future. We believe an integrated view of private markets is especially important now, and in early January we convened investors from across our platform to compare their outlooks in a webcast. Following is a summary of the discussion between Jim Barry, CIO of BlackRock Alternative Investors (BAI) and Global Head of Real Assets; James Keenan, CIO and Global Co-head of Credit; Nathalie von Niederhaeusern, Head of EMEA for Private Equity Partners; and Mark Everitt, Head of Investment Research and Strategy for BlackRock Alternative Investors. How we begin the year We have seen a major rebound from the first quarter trauma of 2020, in new investment opportunities as well as deployment and valuation levels. Improvements in the underlying economy are feeding through into the financials of many underlying assets. We are also seeing increased competition for investments, placing pressure on returns, though these are still at attractive levels. Competition also means less time to close deals and makes it important to have the investment expertise, relationships and legal resources to move quickly. Of the multiple trends accelerated by the pandemic, two in particular stand out: digitization and decarbonization, with the latter also helping to increase the focus on environmental, governance and social (ESG) standards more broadly. The path of the pandemic itself remains a major focus, as positive news about vaccines vies with negative news about infection rates, shutdowns and challenges in vaccinating populations at scale. Digging into deployment High levels of dry powder in private asset classes put a spotlight on deployment rates. We expect the opportunity set to remain robust. Our sourcing funnel finished 2020 at around 90% of 2019 levels—noteworthy given the slowdown earlier in the year—and the momentum continues. In early December we asked a group of our senior investors in BAI what they expect their deployment levels to be in 2021. Over 80% of said they expect deployment to be the same or higher than forecasted pre-Covid. In private credit, for example, we expect to see more opportunities in restructuring and distressed situations, as the effects of shutdowns and structural shifts catch up with more companies. We also expect to see broader private credit markets continue to grow, as more companies (including some with access to public markets) seek the scale and flexibility of the capital now available from direct lenders. Deconstructing digitization The shift of activity into the virtual world is among the pandemic’s most profound effects. Even amid competition we continue to find private equity and credit opportunities in cloud computing companies (to name one example), in part by applying a sharper focus to business models and growth prospects. In real estate, we believe the burgeoning e-commerce market will continue to make the industrial logistics space a favorite. For our part, we are focused on last-mile distribution facilities, where high occupancies and rent growth may benefit logistics landlords. We see location as the main return driver—more so than property quality. In the US, for example, we like properties in the high-barrier and high-income coastal regions, such as Los Angeles and Northern New Jersey/New York. In infrastructure, meanwhile, data centers are evolving as an asset class. We see value in assets servicing large corporate counterparties on a contracted basis. We seek to mitigate risk by targeting data centers able to serve a diverse customer base within the more robust industry sectors, such as life sciences or business services. Recovery plays We have seen a broadening of deal types as economic uncertainty lessened in the second half of 2020, and we think this will continue. In real assets we expect investors to look beyond the sectors with Covid tailwinds to take advantage of cyclical recovery in sectors where valuations may have become overly pessimistic—for example, in regional airports. In credit, our private direct lending teams saw a shift from companies seeking liquidity buffers early in the crisis to companies funding growth into the recovery. This year we expect an increase in acquisition activity to boost demand for direct lending. In private equity last year, activity was concentrated in add-on acquisitions for portfolio companies, which are perceived to be a less risky strategy and accounted for more than 50% of transactions globally, according to Burgiss. This year we expect more interest in new platform companies, with ongoing appetite for exposure to sectors such as technology and healthcare contributing to the trend. An example is the recent acquisition of a private hospital chain in Europe. The attractive valuation reflected the stresses of the pandemic, and the sector is seen as needing consolidation to help smaller hospitals benefit from economies of scale. Downside risks and upside surprises Every outlook needs to look beyond base cases. On the downside, we are alert to: Setbacks in vaccine deployment and fighting the pandemic. Worse than expected damage from structural shifts—for example, in on-street retail or energy. The bill for stimulus, whether in higher taxes, inflation or both. Upside surprises on our radar include: Pent-up demand proves even greater than expected, and impaired sectors come back stronger. Unexpected momentum from uptake of 5G wireless. Major boost from robust US stimulus and public investment. In the US, we expect the policies of the incoming Biden administration to have significant effects on markets. In particular, we think an ambitious green agenda could significantly accelerate the global decarbonization trend, with consequences not just in energy, but in everything from real estate to manufacturing supply chains and beyond.

However, spreads are near historic lows, and some deteriorating terms and transaction quality reinforce our increased focus on credit selection. What we expect We expect credit markets generally to deliver mid-single digit returns this year driven primarily by coupon income (carry) with spread tightening offset by modestly steeper yield curves. We believe accommodative global policy support and vaccine development and distribution will fuel pent up demand which should support an earnings recovery and lead to new investment and a multi-year expansion. Despite our overall constructive tone, investors should anticipate a wider range of outcomes across regions and sectors and focus on credit selection to create differentiated outcomes. '},\n",

A Q&A with Sonia Rocher If environmental, social and governance issues were already on the radar of many private credit funds, their investors and portfolio companies, 2020 looks set to be the year that accelerates the integration of sustainable investment and business practices. But what does ESG integration mean in the context of private debt? And how much leverage does a lender really have with management teams when it comes to encouraging sustainability? We explored these and other issues with Sonia Rocher, managing director in BlackRock’s European private credit group. Why are ESG factors becoming more important for corporates seeking access to capital? We’ve seen a lot of change over the past few years as lenders and investors have been gathering data and monitoring borrowers through more of a sustainability lens. This development has been happening quite rapidly in private credit, but we’re also seeing it across the liquid credit markets, including in areas such as high-yield bonds and leveraged loans. Overall, there is a much greater awareness and understanding of how capital can be directed towards the sustainability agenda. For example, we take a long-term view on companies and why they will be winners – ESG and sustainability factors play strongly into this. As an investor, you want to be sure you are backing companies with a sustainable business model and that holds true across private credit, private equity, public equities and fixed income. That means companies increasingly need to demonstrate their ESG credentials and especially their readiness for climate transition to be successful in capital-raising.

       "  'content': \" Insights from BII’s 2021 Outlook and the importance of EM In our 2021 Institutional Sentiment survey of U.S. and Canadian investors, emerging markets were viewed as the asset class offering the best opportunities in both equity and debt in 2021.1 Likewise, the BlackRock Investment Institute came out with broadly favorable views of EM in its 2021 Outlook. To help investors understand why we’re positive on emerging markets, and where we see the best opportunities, BlackRock’s Chief Client Officer Mark McCombe sat down with our leading EM investors and strategists for a broad-reaching conversation. Mark was joined by Mike Pyle, Global Chief Investment Strategist for the BlackRock Investment Institute; Jeff Shen, Co-CIO of Active Equity and Co-Head of Systematic Active Equity; Gordon Fraser, Co-Head of Global Emerging Markets Equities; and Sergio Trigo Paz, Head of Emerging Markets Fixed Income. Highlights of their discussion are below, and a full replay can be viewed here. BII’s 2021 outlook is constructive on emerging markets, and so are the respondents to our flash survey. What makes you bullish? We're looking for cyclical exposures with upside in 2021, and we think emerging markets will benefit from several tailwinds. Broadly speaking, the change in tone from the new administration in Washington should be a welcome respite from the unpredictability and volatility of the past four years. That boost in sentiment is going to be true across the board, but we believe it will be especially important for emerging markets. We also see the outlook for the U.S. dollar as supportive of EM assets. We're positive on global risk in 2021, which we think is consistent with a somewhat weaker dollar. And the narrowing of the interest rate gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world also points to a weaker dollar, which tends to be quite good for emerging assets. Regionally, when we look at emerging Asia, we see that the public health response has been extremely robust across a range of different economies, and that has left them well-positioned for the near term. Over the longer term, we think that Asia, particularly East Asia, is going to be one of the most important poles of global growth alongside the United States. How have EMs weathered the storm this year and what do you see heading into 2021? We think the Covid-led selloff that EM experienced is setting the scene for a recovery in 2021. The weaker currencies make the economies more competitive, and the capital flight we saw earlier this year has set the stage for a new cycle. We also feel that EM dealt with Covid extremely well compared to much of the developed world. In some of the North Asian countries that moved swiftly and aggressively to contain the outbreak, we’re already seeing output exceed pre-Covid levels. Even some of the countries elsewhere that didn’t impose strict lockdowns and, instead, accepted that the virus would spread, are now experiencing growth in output toward pre-Covid levels. So we think EM is set up really well for a strong cyclical recovery in 2021, and that may surprise some equity market participants. What about EM debt, what has this experience taught us and how are you positioning for next year? Two lessons that stand out this year are that EM debt is diverse and resilient. We’ve seen markets react differently because the economies and are very different—for example, some are commodity exporters and some are commodity importers. But overall the asset class has proved resilient, and part of that stems from the fact that emerging markets have had to withstand a series of crises over the years, so they are better prepared for these types of shocks. Looking ahead, the fact the U.S. has joined the zero-rate club for the foreseeable future is a real game changer. This is going to increase the pressure on U.S. pension funds, insurance companies and other institutions that need income. Given the lack of income available elsewhere, we believe the question is not whether to invest in EM debt, it’s how to invest in EM debt. We talked earlier about the outlook for a weaker U.S. dollar, and we think that points to a particularly favorable environment for local-currency-denominated debt, both sovereign and corporate. We see these as good diversifiers from the dollar, but, of course, selectivity will be key. With selectivity in mind, how are you assessing different regions, countries and industries? Given the differences in the public health and economic policy responses we’ve seen across EM, we think country selection will continue to be very important. At the sector level, the story is largely about the dichotomy between companies operating in the virtual world and those operating in the physical world. But this bifurcation between physical and virtual is also driving performance at the country level. When you put all of this together, that leads to a pretty constructive view of Asia, which has benefitted from strong policy responses and provides investors with a great deal of exposure to the technology sector. And with Asia accounting for close to 80% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, being positive on Asia translates into a positive view on emerging markets broadly. Where do you see winners and losers at the country level? We think the fiscal positions of emerging markets, in general, are in much better shape than developed markets. Unlike in developed markets, there weren’t a lot of handouts to the EM populace. And while deficits have deteriorated, that's largely because revenue lines disappointed. So it’s reasonable to expect that the dollar should weaken against emerging market currencies, at least in real terms. The countries that typically gain the most in this environment are the ones that borrow the most, because the value of their debt drops in local currency terms. The servicing cost of that debt drops, and that acts like a stimulus to the economy. That group of countries includes Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, and—perhaps to a lesser extent—India. We see tailwinds for all these countries heading into next year, and that’s already starting to come through in the earnings of the underlying companies. Some of the countries that are more challenged are those that have dollar pegs or are otherwise more linked to the dollar. For example, parts of the Middle East that don't benefit to the same extent from capital flows. Many clients are bullish on China. How do you think the U.S.-China relationship will play out and what does this mean for investors? Despite the change in the U.S. administration, the relationship will remain a competitive one. There's going to be competition on trade, technology, national security, overall economic stance, and, importantly, on ideology. We really cannot underestimate the importance of the competitive nature of the relationship. That said, we expect to see more clarity and consistency on U.S. policy regarding China, and we also expect to see greater coordination between the U.S. and other countries in dealing with China. For investors, that means that geopolitics, while still important, won’t be the dominant driver that they’ve been over the past four years. Instead, we’ll see a more diverse set of return drivers—including economic fundamentals and company-specific differentiators—and, frankly, we think investors will view that as a welcome change. Should investors access Chinese equities via a standalone exposure or as part of a broader EM allocation? There are good arguments for both approaches. China's very cyclical, and, unlike other emerging markets, it has very short, sharp cycles. That’s because the policy transmission mechanism in China is so quick and so effective. So there is a real opportunity for broad emerging market funds to add value by tactically allocating in and out of China, if they can get these cycles right. A structural argument in favor of the China-specific approach is the sheer diversity of the stock market there. The liquidity and diversity—particularly in the A-share market—is tremendous. There are roughly 2,000 liquid stocks to invest in, with a huge variety of sectors that you don't really see in other emerging markets. That gives active managers many different levers to drive returns. But one thing to be cautious of with China-only strategies is style bias—it’s something that we see a lot of in that space. What about the Chinese bond market, how are you thinking about investing there? The market is seeing increased inflows due to higher rates and investors’ search for diversifying assets. At the same time, the government has successfully managed the pandemic, so rates may not go lower and inflation could rear its head. That type of environment is more conducive to carry trades than it is to duration trades. Another interesting dynamic we’re seeing is that Chinese bonds aren’t necessarily competing with other EM debt to attract investor inflows. In fact, they’re often competing with investors’ allocations to core developed markets. That’s a reflection of both the zero-rate environment in the developed world and of how much the Chinese debt markets have grown and developed.

       "  'content': ' More sector-specific, and a bigger role for fresh capital Credit markets have travelled an unprecedented path this year, driven dramatically down by the Covid-19 shock and then revived by a massive policy response. Thus began a cycle that we believe is now headed for an equally unprecedented phase of distress and restructuring — similar in scale to the post-2008 default wave, but differing in important ways. For many debt issuers and their stakeholders, the period will doubtless be a difficult one. At the same time, investors prepared to navigate a different sort of cycle may find opportunities in the rebuilding ahead. Download distressed credit paper More leverage, more debt, and differing amounts of distress across sectors Growth in company leverage in U.S. leveraged finance markets (left) and sub-investment grade and private debt (right); distressed debt by sector (bottom) We anticipate three key differences between the coming cycle and the period after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). First, distressed investing after the GFC most often entailed post-default purchases of corporate debt in the secondary market. Now, after a decade of structural change in the credit markets — eroding protection for lenders as well as shifts in who holds the debt — the dynamics of restructuring are likely to change too. While the purchase of discounted claims, loans and bonds will have an ongoing role, we also see a potential need for new capital being injected directly into stressed and distressed companies. This will often mean earlier engagement with issuers and working across the capital structure with a wider array of creditors and shareholders. Second, instead of being able to rely on a broad-based economic recovery to improve value, we think investors will need to be keenly attuned to the sector-specific impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although fiscal and monetary support is cushioning some of the near-term impact, the pandemic is already driving deep economic change that benefits some industries, technologies and business models, while severely challenging others. Finally, these impacts are being felt across a credit market far larger than it was at the time of the GFC. Sub-investment grade debt has increased nearly threefold to about US$5.6 trillion today vs. about US$2 trillion in 2007. Private credit, meanwhile, has expanded to US$850 billion as of December 31, 2019 and is on pace to exceed US$1 trillion by the end of this year. Companies themselves are more highly levered. Debt levels for companies funded in the U.S. leveraged finance markets averaged above four times EBITDA at March 31, 2020, compared to under three times in 2008, and they are at the beginning of what we expect to be a challenging economic cycle: Year-over-year revenue growth for U.S. high yield companies was -15% in the second quarter of 2020. The charts above show the growth in debt outstanding and leverage levels, and how the pandemic has already created different levels of distress in different sectors across the high yield market. We expect sector dispersion to increase as the effects of economic stimulus wane and the pandemic grinds on. The amount of debt trading at distressed prices has fallen sharply amid the market rally that began in March, from over US$400 billion to around US$73 billion as of August 31, 2020, and the implied five-year cumulative default rate on CCC bonds has declined from 61% at the March highs to around 45% as of September 27, 2020. However, much of this improvement is likely to prove temporary. While a significant amount of capital has been raised in recent years to invest in distressed credit (we estimate dry powder of approximately US$130 to US$150 billion), we think it still may not be enough to meet the funding needs of this cycle. Evolution of market structure A greater strategic allocation to credit from global institutional investors has contributed to an evolving ownership profile aided by the significant expansion of investment tools like exchange traded funds. The makeup of market segments has evolved as well. Within high yield, the size of[ the average issuer has grown larger as smaller issuers have increasingly sought capital through private markets. The pandemic is driving further shifts. As in prior credit cycles, we have seen significant fallen angel downgrades (more than US$150 billion this year through August 31, 2020 according to Credit Suisse, although the pace slowed as stimulus took hold) from an investment grade market more dominated by BBBs than it has been historically. Changes in the bank loan market are likely to play an especially significant role in this credit cycle. CLOs now own nearly 60% of the loan market as investors have flocked to structured credit as a tool for investing in loans across a range of rating tranches. As the charts below highlight, while CLO ownership has grown, the loosening of covenants leaves the loan market approximately 75% covenant-lite today, while the quality of the loan market has slipped with greater single-B issuance. Although CLO structures have improved since the GFC, the combination of covenant-lite assets and structured liabilities remains a critical risk consideration for investors, and puts additional focus on the quality of the CLO managers themselves in addition to the underlying loan collateral. Bank loans: Increasingly cov-lite, increasingly held in CLOs Loan covenant quality as tracked by Moody’s (left) and growth in loans, CLOs, and CLO % of loans (right) Much has been written about the growth of covenant-lite debt, but we think the implications on corporate restructurings remain underappreciated. Greater financial flexibility for issuers may be to the detriment of debt holders, as additional senior or pari-passu debt is injected into distressed capital structures. This is likely to exacerbate the dynamic between buyers of secondary debt looking for control versus those seeking to maintain or refinance debt with better lender protections. Looser covenants may initially help issuers avoid technical default while putting more pressure on the various classes of creditors and shareholders to align on a restructuring plan that serves a wider range of constituent needs. The different composition of debt holders entering this distressed cycle is an important consideration as well. At the start of the GFC, bank proprietary trading desks and hedge funds with redemption structures were major holders and buyers of risk. Today there is more ownership diversity across a wider universe of locked-up capital from private funds, as well as closed-end funds, CLOs, and longer-term institutional investors. For issuers this is a mixed blessing. With the exception of those using the direct lending markets, risk is generally more distributed, and the funding basis of investors is more robust. At the same time, these holders have varying motivations and constraints, sometimes including the need to sell in the event of a downgrade. While in past conflicts outcomes were typically directed between different classes of debt, there may be more strife now between different types of holders — for example, par versus secondary or distress-for-control versus CLOs looking for reinstatement. Structurally diminished liquidity and potential forced de-leveraging among private investors are also important considerations today. Dealers have limited capacity to warehouse risk because of post-GFC regulatory changes, and investors may find it more difficult to construct a diversified portfolio with fewer blocks consistently on offer. Meanwhile, levered private fund investors such as Business Development Companies (BDCs) may find themselves in need of secondary liquidity in circumstances where investments experience increased leverage with a drop off in earnings that pushes funds beyond leverage limits and creates a need to sell investments to de-lever. These structural differences are likely to impact the trajectory and duration of distressed investing this cycle. The availability and growth of private credit to step in as a financing source for more complex and lower quality issuers can better align issuer needs with longer lockup capital that is capable of constructing more bespoke solutions. The composition of opportunities in public markets as a result shifts to larger and/or more established businesses in many cases. Regardless, the key will be finding alignment between the needs of the company and the breadth of priorities of its creditors. Restructuring and post-default scenarios Given the structural changes in the market, what might restructurings look like in the quarters to come? We anticipate two basic types: A continuation of the slow-motion, well known restructurings we have seen historically, and an increase in liquidity-driven defaults where companies are forced into bankruptcy due to quickly changing business conditions or the inability to come to terms with creditors. Buying distressed debt on the secondary market will continue to be an effective way to capitalize on dislocation and market inefficiency, we believe — but may often need to be done in tandem with the ability to provide fresh capital to keep companies out of insolvency or help recapitalize them to exit a bankruptcy process. We expect this cycle will require a broader investment perspective and a more comprehensive toolkit to enable engagement with companies in different stages of restructuring, from stressed-but-still-solvent all the way through bankruptcy and recovery. The list is long, and ranges from rescue financing, rights offerings, debtor-in-possession loans and exit financing to more specialized tools such as vendor financing. Market dynamics since the pandemic began have created a variety of investment opportunities. For example, convertible bond issuance has accelerated this year (more than $84b in U.S. dollar convertibles as of August 25th per Bloomberg) amid the heightened economic uncertainty and elevated volatility. By bundling an equity option with their bonds, companies have been able to issue debt with lower coupons. Should equity prices decline, however, these convertibles will trade at a steep discount to par, because “busted” converts must make up for in price what they lack in coupon, to deliver a similar all-in yield to the market. These discounts create an opening where investors and companies can work together to create “win/win” transactions via debt-for-debt-exchanges, debt-for-equity-exchanges, early buybacks and other capital structure optimization transactions. Implications of the pandemic for business models As investors consider which industries and companies to get involved with, we think it is imperative to examine each company’s business operating model in light of the changes driven by the pandemic. The stark difference in performance between airlines and technology companies or leisure and healthcare companies is just a starting point. Even in the hardest-hit sectors there will be winners — oftentimes, companies well positioned to consolidate — while sectors enjoying an overall tailwind will still have losers. Notably in the leveraged finance and private credit markets, the companies in question are often not tier 1 businesses but value chain companies (suppliers, consumers), sub-scale competitors, or startups in the early stages of growth. Companies are focusing closely now on refinancing to term out debt and lock in capital where they can, rationalizing business structures to create greater efficiency and reduce cost, and restructuring debt to align debt profile to the issuer in a post-pandemic world. The market recovery since March has disproportionally benefited higher-quality companies in sectors less directly affected by Covid-19. Low rates, and the recovery in spreads to near pre-pandemic tights leads to greater M&A activity and financial engineering. As is highlighted in the chart below, lower-quality credit has lagged in the recovery, particularly in sectors impacted significantly by Covid-19. Regardless, investors will need a well-informed view on where both the sector and the specific company are headed. In recent years, some distressed investors in the energy space have learned the hard lesson that buying cheap doesn’t matter if you can’t find an exit. We expect that lesson to be highly relevant in a post-Covid world. Headwinds for some sectors, tailwinds for others Dispersion of returns for high yield issues across industry sectors Looking ahead As mentioned above, we believe the amount of capital needed over the next couple of years exceeds the amount that has been raised to date. However, investors are moving quickly to pursue investment opportunities and we expect the market to be competitive. For example, we are seeing a number of private equity firms raise equity and credit funds to deploy into distressed opportunities either by buying the company or injecting structured equity/junior credit to help finance restructurings and turnarounds. This will be a significant pool of capital to be deployed that did not exist in past cycles. The increasing need for capital and a growing supply of investors seeking to deploy into these opportunities will require greater selectivity. Unlike traditional public market syndicated transactions where price discovery and deal comparisons are more readily available, highly bespoke and privately structured deals are less easily assessed. It is therefore critical to maximize visibility across deals while remaining highly selective about participation. In other words, see a lot to do a little. The investment opportunity for distressed investing this cycle is significant. As we highlighted, the scale of opportunities and the range of potential solutions are likely to make this cycle historically unique. The economic uncertainty, outlook for monetary and fiscal policy, and ongoing potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will have enormous consequences on corporate results, outlook and opportunities in the years ahead. As we emerge from the pandemic lockdown, we believe the distressed investment opportunity is attractive for those able to build flexible portfolios that can take advantage of a wide range of potential investment solutions. Companies are being forced to think outside the box, and investors should too. Download “A different sort of distressed-credit cycle” '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Nearly everywhere we look in 2020, we see bifurcation, across macroeconomic indicators, countries, sectors and investment strategies. To help explain what’s driving this, we recently sat down with three of BlackRock’s Systematic investors, Jeff Shen and Raffaele Savi, co-CIO’s of Systematic Active Equities, and Tom Parker, CIO of Systematic Fixed Income, to take a deeper look at the bifurcation across markets and to explore some opportunities that systematic investors have been capitalizing on. Can you explain the bifurcation in performance this year? How do you think investors will remember 2020? Raffaele Savi: This year has been a year of divergence between the physical and the virtual. If you operated in the virtual world, you had a tailwind from COVID-19. If you operated in the physical world, this year has been a massive headwind. How that’s been translated in equity markets has been quite unique. If you look at the divergence in performance between the winners and the losers, the haves and the have nots, it’s one of the biggest on record. You can go back 100 years, and it’s hard to find this type of dispersion in country and sector performance. This dispersion informs a lot of the drivers of active performance this year. Looking at momentum versus value, there has been big divergence. The underperformance of value has been a pain point for a lot of investors. What we’ve seen this year is a combination of things. There are investments captured in value today that are structurally disrupted businesses, businesses facing challenges for decades like European banks. There are businesses that are dependent on commodity prices like oil and energy, but there are also companies like airlines or cruise lines that are truly COVID value stories. Looking across quantitative strategies, there has never been this kind of performance gap in history. I think it truly has depended on a few things: whether your process was dynamic; whether you were ready to adjust to a very different market environment; or whether you stuck to a very static view of what the right allocation was across different ideas in your portfolio. If your process was modern, and you were fully invested in alternative data, or if you dismissed that as a big alpha opportunity was a key differentiator. 2020 will probably be a remembered as the year in which alternative data became table stakes for investors. It’s very hard to navigate this sort of this fast-changing environment without ideas of how consumers are changing their purchasing patterns in real time, how this evolution has played out in different parts of the market, and in different countries. In 2020 we saw virtual outperform physical, dynamic outperform static, and modern outperform traditional – and that’s driven the big separation we’ve seen in terms of performance. 2020 has been an odd year for everyone. What previous market environment has the most in common with the 11 months we’ve just gone through? Jeff Shen: 2020 has been an extraordinary year; quite different from any in our recent memory. When you go back in history and look at which period is most similar, it’s quite interesting. 2020 is not a global financial crisis. The GFC period in 2008 was quite different compared to what we have gone through this year. There are a few reasons for that, but I think one observation is that the market dynamics are quite different. This year is more like the early 1990s. If you do the analysis, you realize the current cycle has been pushed into a little bit of an earlier phase. We were certainly looking more and more like late cycle, but COVID has pushed the economic cycle to be more like the early part of a recovery. Two characteristics are driving this trend. One is lower interest rates, especially in the U.S. and in other developed markets. They are pushing us closer to an early cycle comparison. Second is value underperformance, which has been significant, and also shares more similarities to an early part of an economic cycle. How has this recession been different from previous recessions? Tom Parker: Housing has always been a leading indicator of previous recessions. You can see that in the falling yellow line in the chart below, that occurs before every recession shown. Housing leads you in, and you know you’re in a recovery when housing starts booming. And that’s been a consistent pattern over time. US House Sales and US Unemployment Rate Source: Bloomberg, August 2020. The 2008 recession is notable for the extremely slow recovery in housing relative to previous recessions. The lack of strength in the recovery was primarily due to the fact that housing was ground zero in the boom and the bust. In that case, we had the slowest housing recovery in history. It’s interesting to note that lower housing and lower government spending explained most of the difference of the post-2008 recovery relative to the long-term average. It’s also interesting to note, just as this low housing and low government spending explained the recovery in the early 2010s, there was a big jump in housing late in the cycle that helped the economy over the last four years. This also increased government spending, which might be contrary to people’s preconceptions of what determined that recovery. The current recession, seen at the far-right side of the chart above, shows rising home sales into the 2020 recession. There was no slowdown. In fact, we had an acceleration of home sales. We got a small dip in the March period, and then we’ve had a boom. This is different from every other kind of recession that we’ve seen previously. A lot of the contributors we’ve seen in this recession have been different than previous recessions, and that difference is due to COVID-19. It has produced sudden-stop-and-restart economics. These trends have resulted in some of the dramatic bifurcations we’ve seen in markets this year. '},\n",

Over the course of the last decade, BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) team has sought to capitalize on the changing landscape. Download full report Top-down and bottom-up Much of the focus during this time has been on identifying differentiated alpha insights from non-obvious relationships uncovered via machine learning techniques in combination with novel sources of alternative data. While these techniques have become popular among quantitative equity investors, they are often beyond the reach of typical macro investors, those focused on the broad economic and geopolitical backdrop. These alternative tools only increase in importance during unusual times, such as the coronavirus crisis, allowing quicker analysis of a faster-changing investment backdrop. Because BlackRock SAE has already built the technology infrastructure needed to process massive amounts of data to produce investment insights for individual securities, we are able to use this approach to produce differentiated insights within the macro space as well. At its core, this approach is intuition grounded in economic fundamentals, supplemented by novel techniques and data sources, implemented in a systematic, unbiased fashion. Using a rigorous research process, we seek to generate uncorrelated investment ideas that offer a strategic advantage in timing important sources of asset price returns that are impacted by broad economic trends. Ultimately, BlackRock SAE is able to marry security-level bottom-up insights with macro-level top-down views in order to inform our positions on major drivers of returns, such as country, industry and style factors. We outline four important topics that are central to macro investing. Each of these helps form our differentiated approach to systematic macro investing. 1: Uncovering macro regimes Quantitative investors typically look for strategies that have consistent performance over long periods of history, but don’t react quickly to changes in the macroeconomic environment. We employ dynamic strategy allocation that accounts for different market conditions, borrow techniques from the machine-learning community and literature to take a different approach for the identification of macroeconomic regimes. 2: Assessing monetary policy sentiment To best capture sentiment around the monetary policy cycle, we have used natural language processing techniques on large corpuses of broker reports, news, publications and speeches by monetary policy committee members to attribute sentiment around future monetary policy decisions. The trickiest aspect of this exercise is filtering tens of thousands of documents down to those that are relevant to central bank behavior and specifically to individual countries’ policies. 3: Measuring macroeconomic uncertainty Uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment is traditionally hard to measure simply because macroeconomic series are released at low frequency. At the same time, the behavior of companies and policymakers is deeply affected by macroeconomic uncertainty. SAE has developed innovative tools for natural language processing that have typically been applied to text and transcripts associated with specific companies. Measuring macroeconomic uncertainty is possible using similar techniques augmented with adjustments that allow us to isolate information pertinent to countries rather than companies and appropriately design text queries. We offer an example of our differentiated process at work. Improving measures of macroeconomic uncertaintySeeking to capture what the broad indexes miss. Source: Bloomberg and BlackRock SAE as of July 31, 2016. Past performance is no guarantee of current or future results. 4: Using alternative data to form differentiated macro views SAE has broadened the search for alternative data sources, not only to pinpoint more granular and differentiated views on individual companies, but to improve our understanding of the macroeconomic environment. We are often able to capture more timely and granular views on macroeconomic conditions by using data that has a direct link to the broader economy, such as to track consumer sentiment, government contracts to reflect government spending, or maritime shipment counts to capture trade activity.

Download full report Strategic evolution The first private equity funds were created in the 1950s. However, there were few such formal structures and they were mostly marketed to individual investors rather than to institutional investors. A series of regulatory changes in the US and Europe enabled institutional investors to effectively outsource the management of fund investments to specialized firms and eliminate the need for in-house expertise. These favorable regulatory events together with the evolution of the limited partnership resulted in a spectacular growth of the private equity industry.

All dollar figures are USD. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future returns. However, as opposed to public equity investments where the investor is immediately fully invested, private equity managers call committed capital from their investors over time as they find investment opportunities and distribute principal and gains as investments are exited. For this reason, the timing and size of cash flows is more important than in traditional asset classes. Private equity practitioners do not typically report time-weighted returns but analyze and report performance in a money-weighted performance metric, the internal rate of return (IRR). The money-weighted mechanic of the IRR better reflects the timing and size of the underlying cash flows. In addition, TVPI and other multiples are used to reflect cash-on-cash returns. Historical performance Consistent outperformance over public markets over the past four decades Pooled, absolute and relative performance Source: Global private equity fund pooled, absolute and relative performance against the MSCI World index for 40 vintage years and 4 pooled aggregates – all in USD as of 31 December 2019. Private Equity data sourced from Burgiss covers vintages 1980-2019, 5,643 funds, and USD 3,992 billion in market capitalization. Private equity strategies include all equity strategies. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future returns. The above figure demonstrates strong performance for each of the four decades in isolation for various aggregates on both an absolute (IRR) and relative (direct alpha) basis. In aggregate and since inception, the direct alpha over these 40 vintage years (1980-2019) is 5.7%. This pooled outperformance is also substantial, when looking at different time windows and ranges from 3.6% for 5 years to 4.4% for 15 years. The 10-year pooled outperformance is the lowest, resulting from the longest public equity rally in history fueled by monetary policies. The equivalent outperformance on an absolute basis for TVPI ranges from 9% for 5 years to 16% for 15 years. On a look-through basis, the direct alpha or pooled outperformance over the MSCI World index is positive in 37 of 40 vintages. Key Takeaways Private equity outperformance over the MSCI World index is consistently positive and reports a lower decline than public markets during periods of high market volatility. Whether public or private, equity investments are exposed to the same factors and hence private equity returns show a high correlation with public returns. In the next decade, we see the private equity industry evolving with the democratization of access, the impact of technology, focus on ESG/impact investing, and the integration of equities.

Explore how a style factor-based approach to US corporate bonds may potentially generate improved absolute and risk-adjusted returns. Download now Style investing in fixed income Equity and fixed income investors alike have often strived to discern the drivers of investment returns. Over time, clear and persistent drivers of returns—known as “factors”—have been identified. BlackRock’s research has shown that the core principle of factor investing—systematically identifying and capturing persistent risk premia—also applies to bond markets. Style factors help explain differences in risks and returns within asset classes. Historically, style factors represent characteristics, such as quality and value, which may determine, for example, why one group of corporate bonds may have outperformed another.1 BlackRock has identified a broad set of fixed income style factors grounded in intuitive, fundamental investment concepts. The figure below provides an overview of the four principal style factors—quality, value, momentum, and low volatility—that we believe have the most application for investors. Overview of fixed income style factors Source: BlackRock. Based on the opinions of the Systematic Fixed Income Group as of October 2020. Forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions, there is no guarantee that they will be achieved. The information shown above is for illustrative purposes only and not meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Style factor application: Reach for Safety NOT Yield Today’s low yield environment has made it challenging to generate income and total returns while managing corporate bond risk. Investors are often forced to reach for yield and take on more risk to meet return and income targets—further bidding up the prices of the riskiest securities. While reaching for yield may work in upward trending markets, avoiding defaults when the credit cycle turns downward is extremely important to maximize total return in the long run. Consider an alternative approach to investing in US corporate bonds that reaches for safety—not yield. Implementing style factors in US corporate bond portfolios A “reach for safety” approach to credit investing blends the characteristics of two diversifying2 style factors—quality and value—into a single portfolio that seeks to minimize the drawbacks of reach for yield portfolios. First, a quality factor screen can be used to remove riskier securities that have a higher probability of default. Intuitively, we believe removing such securities may help provide downside mitigation and avoid the behavioral bias of chasing yield in riskier securities. Second, a value factor tilt can be used to favor bonds that appear to be underpriced relative to fundamentals. Value is a historically rewarded risk factor which seeks to identify bonds that are inexpensive relative to their financial strength.3 Blended style factor portfolio construction process Source: BlackRock. Investment process is shown for illustrative purposes only and is subject to change. Such an approach allows for the screening of riskier, overvalued exposures while simultaneously seeking to preserve market context yields and improve total return potential with less cyclicality. Moving from factor theory to portfolio practice This style factor framework has been developed into a set of rules-based credit indices through the BlackRock Investment Grade Enhanced Bond Index and the BlackRock High Yield Defensive Bond Index. These indices may provide opportunities to meet a mix of client objectives such as higher total returns, lower volatility and superior risk-adjusted returns versus market-capitalization-weighted allocations. Although the current live track record for these indices is only three years long, we believe the current results and the future of fixed income style factor investing are promising.

Over the course of the last decade, BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) team has sought to capitalize on the changing landscape. Download full report Top-down and bottom-up Much of the focus during this time has been on identifying differentiated alpha insights from non-obvious relationships uncovered via machine learning techniques in combination with novel sources of alternative data. While these techniques have become popular among quantitative equity investors, they are often beyond the reach of typical macro investors, those focused on the broad economic and geopolitical backdrop. These alternative tools only increase in importance during unusual times, such as the coronavirus crisis, allowing quicker analysis of a faster-changing investment backdrop. Because BlackRock SAE has already built the technology infrastructure needed to process massive amounts of data to produce investment insights for individual securities, we are able to use this approach to produce differentiated insights within the macro space as well. At its core, this approach is intuition grounded in economic fundamentals, supplemented by novel techniques and data sources, implemented in a systematic, unbiased fashion. Using a rigorous research process, we seek to generate uncorrelated investment ideas that offer a strategic advantage in timing important sources of asset price returns that are impacted by broad economic trends. Ultimately, BlackRock SAE is able to marry security-level bottom-up insights with macro-level top-down views in order to inform our positions on major drivers of returns, such as country, industry and style factors. We outline four important topics that are central to macro investing. Each of these helps form our differentiated approach to systematic macro investing. 1: Uncovering macro regimes Quantitative investors typically look for strategies that have consistent performance over long periods of history, but don’t react quickly to changes in the macroeconomic environment. We employ dynamic strategy allocation that accounts for different market conditions, borrow techniques from the machine-learning community and literature to take a different approach for the identification of macroeconomic regimes. 2: Assessing monetary policy sentiment To best capture sentiment around the monetary policy cycle, we have used natural language processing techniques on large corpuses of broker reports, news, publications and speeches by monetary policy committee members to attribute sentiment around future monetary policy decisions. The trickiest aspect of this exercise is filtering tens of thousands of documents down to those that are relevant to central bank behavior and specifically to individual countries’ policies. 3: Measuring macroeconomic uncertainty Uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment is traditionally hard to measure simply because macroeconomic series are released at low frequency. At the same time, the behavior of companies and policymakers is deeply affected by macroeconomic uncertainty. SAE has developed innovative tools for natural language processing that have typically been applied to text and transcripts associated with specific companies. Measuring macroeconomic uncertainty is possible using similar techniques augmented with adjustments that allow us to isolate information pertinent to countries rather than companies and appropriately design text queries. We offer an example of our differentiated process at work. Improving measures of macroeconomic uncertaintySeeking to capture what the broad indexes miss. Source: Bloomberg and BlackRock SAE as of July 31, 2016. Past performance is no guarantee of current or future results. 4: Using alternative data to form differentiated macro views SAE has broadened the search for alternative data sources, not only to pinpoint more granular and differentiated views on individual companies, but to improve our understanding of the macroeconomic environment. We are often able to capture more timely and granular views on macroeconomic conditions by using data that has a direct link to the broader economy, such as to track consumer sentiment, government contracts to reflect government spending, or maritime shipment counts to capture trade activity.

       "  'description': 'Global Tactical Asset Allocation strategies have evolved into high breadth, liquid multi-asset investments designed to help deliver excess returns to a whole portfolio.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Sudden swings in market volatility and changing correlations between asset classes can lead us to rethink the construction of even the most thoughtful long-term strategic asset allocation. Investors can underestimate both the risk and opportunity these shorter-term fluctuations represent for their portfolios. By incorporating strategies that can operate on these shorter, more tactical time horizons, investors can add further diversification to long-term oriented portfolios. Click here to download full report What is GTAA? Global tactical asset allocation (“GTAA”) strategies serve as a counterpoint to long-term strategic asset allocations (“SAAs”), while still respecting targeted investment objectives. The breadth of these strategies adds opportunistic tilting away from SAAs, with the aim of capitalizing on shorter-term opportunities that may arise from market forces such as structural impediments, information asymmetries and innate human behaviors. The key feature of a successful GTAA strategy is maintaining a low correlation with other sources of return, both the broad asset classes in client SAAs as well as common factor returns and security selection alpha sources. If correlations with other portfolio return drivers remain muted, then this can be a highly additive contributor to whole portfolio results. Source: BlackRock as of June 2020. For illustrative purposes only. There is no guarantee that a positive investment outcome will be achieved. What prompts organizations to consider GTAA? As forward-looking expected returns and yields have compressed, many clients have shifted their asset allocations on a strategic basis into assets traditionally thought of as “riskier.”1 As expectations for improved outcomes in return or yield increase, they may bring with them unintended combinations of lower liquidity in stressed environments. GTAA strategies offer the potential to mitigate these risks through a combination of improved diversification benefits and enhanced risk-adjusted returns investing in liquid assets across asset classes. Most SAA processes rely on very long-term capital market assumptions around single asset returns and cross-asset correlations. We acknowledge the difficulty inherent in forecasting future returns. While capital market assumption analysis is valuable in assisting investors in the evaluation of more aggressive or conservative forecasts, this also highlights the wide range of potential outcomes, which can undermine our confidence in achieving desired long-term outcomes. GTAA is not a strategy that operates in isolation, but rather one that complements all the other drivers of whole portfolio risk and return. Episodic bouts of market volatility and the effect of geopolitical news on markets are seemingly more impactful as they punctuate an otherwise extended period of low volatility over the past decade. As a result, fiduciaries increasingly may question where we are in the cycle and how asset valuations stack up. In the post-pandemic period, we believe geopolitical stresses that existed before the crisis are likely to accelerate. Some clients are searching for immediate actions that can be taken in their portfolios around redeploying capital or adjusting exposures. GTAA strategies offer a flexible and nimble multi-asset solution that can capitalize on these exact market dynamics. What creates the opportunity for GTAA to make money? Financial markets are never at precise equilibrium due to the many cross currents of structural and behavioral forces. In our experience, a few persistent features of markets contribute to macro pricing inefficiencies which create opportunities for skilled GTAA investors2: Market segmentation and structural impediments Information and processing asymmetries Non-profit-motivated players This combination of market structure, asymmetrical information and different incentives across market participants leads to the variety of opportunities that GTAA investors seek to capitalize upon. Implemented in concert with traditional beta and alpha sources, a GTAA investment framework is set apart by its uncorrelated return profile, financial instrument breadth, and forward-looking application of alternative data. The outcome of this approach is a portfolio constructed from an adaptive opportunity set, which continually seeks to maximize potential return, mitigates unintended risks, and acts as a principal driver of long-term performance.

       "' We lay out how our strategic asset views are positioned for a new regime of greater macroeconomic and market volatility. The Great Moderation is over The Great Moderation, a period of steady growth and inflation, is over, in our view. Instead, we are in a new regime of heightened macro volatility driven by production constraints - due to post-Covid supply disruptions and labor shortages in the near-term and structural forces such as a bumpy net-zero transition and a rewiring of global supply chains amid geopolitical tensions over a longer horizon. This warrants higher risk premia – the compensation investors want for holding assets - for bonds and equities. We ultimately expect central banks to live with inflation, but only after stalling growth. The result? Persistent inflation amid sharp and short swings in economic activity. End of the Great Moderation Volatility of U.S. GDP and CPI, 1965-2022 Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and Labor Department, with data from Haver Analytics, August 2022. Notes: The chart shows the standard deviation of the annualized quarterly change of U.S. GDP and the Consumer Price Index. More frequent strategic view changes The new regime means strategic views – that typically remain relatively stable – will likely need more frequent adjustments. The investment playbook will also be significantly different than the past. A higher risk premium and worsening macro backdrop lowers our expected equity returns, spurring a reduction in our overweight to the asset class to only a modest preference. We overweight investment grade credit In fixed income, the rising rate environment, higher inflation and elevated debt loads means we go maximum underweight nominal developed market (DM) government bonds. We prefer inflation-linked bonds (now maximum overweight) and credit, particularly investment grade, where we turn overweight for the first time in two years. Overall in duration, our preference for IG credit and inflation-linked bonds offsets our underweight nominal government bonds. Higher risk premia ahead We have adjusted our medium-term estimates of the risk premia for equity and credit markets to better reflect the wider range of macro outcomes ahead. Our new estimates are modestly higher than prior ones reflecting our view that a more volatile world should mean investors demand more compensation to take on risk. Our prior estimates were based on historical prices through the great moderation. We don’t see current levels of macro volatility to persist – yet we don’t see it falling back to pre-pandemic levels. Bumpier net-zero transition factored in Our capital market assumptions (CMAs) incorporate our best, current estimate of how the net-zero transition will unfold. We have revisited our assumptions around the transition in this update yet acknowledge there is great uncertainty around this. A key takeaway of our ongoing work is that we see a bumpier transition than before – manifesting as supply shocks and regional divergences – as economies and sectors such as energy and transportation are reshaped. The upshot: more macro volatility. We will update our views on the transition and strategic investment implications in a paper in coming months. Access all our portfolio construction work on our hub. The new regime is a riskier one than the Great Moderation, in our view. That means investors should demand more compensation for taking the same levels of risk – higher risk premia. Our CMAs and strategic views had already been positioned for a high inflation risk premium – most directly via an overweight to inflation-linked bonds and a long-standing underweight to nominal developed market government bonds. In our latest update, we incorporate the impact of a higher – currently unpriced equity risk premium – that lowers our expected risk-adjusted equity returns at a 10-year horizon. A higher equity risk premium and deteriorating macro backdrop trims our overweight to DM equities to a modest one at +1. We still have a strategic preference for equities for the long term as we see central banks ultimately pivoting to living with some inflation. Another notable change this quarter is that we turn overweight public credit for the first time in more than a year. The colored boxes on the chart on the right below shows our latest strategic preferences compared to our prior views shown by the dots. We think strategic allocations - that typically would have remained relatively stable in a world of low macro and market volatility – will likely need more frequent adjustments.

It is intended for information purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. 3 factors driving regime change First, production constraints – stemming from a massive shift in spending and labor shortages - are hampering the economy and driving inflation. Over a strategic horizon, we expect structural forces such as a bumpier transition to net zero and a rewiring of global supply chains to contribute to supply shocks. Second, record debt levels mean small changes in interest rates have an outsized impact on governments, households and companies – limiting how far central banks can go in raising rates and forcing them to live with some inflation. Third, we find the politicization of everything – from inflation to climate change to geopolitics – raising the risk of oversimplified policy solutions in a more complex world. The growth-inflation trade-off Policymakers face a tougher trade-off between growth and inflation today than when demand shocks dominated. Monetary policy was more effective in influencing demand – and helped to suppress volatility. It is less suited to supply shocks, in our view, meaning policymakers may face a worse mix of higher output or inflation volatility. Reining inflation comes at a much greater cost to growth. Preserving growth comes with much higher inflation. That is at the crux of the problem central banks are grappling with currently. We see most developed market central banks taking policy into restrictive territory, but ultimately pivoting and choosing to live with some inflation as the cost to growth becomes clear. That’s why we think the volatility of each will be higher in the new regime. We expect inflation to remain above target in the U.S. over the next 5 years. The choppy restart following Covid offered a glimpse of the long-term impact structural supply shocks may have on the economy. A notable example is the net-zero transition, as we now believe it will be bumpier and a bigger drag in coming years than we previously anticipated. There is great uncertainty around how the conundrum facing policymakers gets resolved. Central banks have turned increasingly hawkish to counter elevated inflationary pressures, sparking a sharp repricing higher of expected policy rate paths. That rhetoric has intensified since our last update as policymakers continue to respond to the politics of inflation. We no longer expect central banks to pause at neutral – the level of rates that is neither restrictive or stimulative – even though tighter policy does little to address supply-driven inflation. It does mean growth over the near term suffers as interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy bear the brunt. In our CMAs, we further raise our estimates for the policy path across major central banks that feed directly into our expected returns across asset classes, most notably fixed income. Upgrading credit to overweight We see nominal yields in five years’ time significantly higher than current levels. That repricing is a valuation drag on expected returns for nominal government bonds. We go back to a maximum underweight stance on the asset class and prefer to take duration risk in credit, particularly higher quality investment grade. We turn overweight both IG and high yield (HY) credit in developed markets for the first time in more than two years. Widening credit spreads Widening spreads – partly a reflection of growth fears – have pushed up our expected returns and brightened the risk-reward for credit. Slowing economic growth is a valid risk – yet we don’t expect the kind of deep recession that would cause defaults and downgrades to explode higher and damage the case for credit. In that backdrop, we think higher spreads and higher government bond yields – both drivers of our expected credit returns – make credit an asset class with attractive income potential. An anticipation of wider spreads and higher yields had kept us underweight public credit. Both are now at more attractive levels – and spreads are no longer a drag to returns. The chart on the left below shows how valuation, the impact of higher spot yields and higher expected income have pushed up our expected returns across DM credit markets. We see spreads compressing over a strategic horizon as the economy stabilizes following central bank pivots. We see spreads compressing over time, yet not immediately. Higher inflation Finally in fixed income, we return to a maximum overweight on inflation-protected government bonds. Why? We believe markets are once again underappreciating the persistence of higher inflation. The U.S. inflation breakeven rate fell sharply over the second quarter from its March 2022 peaks – see chart on the right below – due to broader risk-off sentiment and as recession fears took hold. The drop has taken market-implied pricing well below our estimates for forward inflation expectations over the next five years – the yellow dot in the chart. Global equities struggled over the second quarter. Markets have recovered some losses in recent weeks, yet the broad MSCI World index of DM equities is still down 15% year-to-date, according to Refinitiv data as of Aug. 8, 2022. Typically, falling prices would mean we would expect to see higher expected returns as, all else equal, valuations become more attractive. Yet, all else has not remained equal. Markets have grappled with the difficult trade-off that central banks face between choking off growth via sharply higher rates or living with supply-driven inflation. Tough rhetoric from central banks on inflation suggests interest rates – across most of DM – are likely to move past neutral into restrictive territory. Beyond tighter monetary policy, the implications of the energy price shock – particularly painful for Europe – and China’s strict Covid lockdowns are weighing on the near-term economic outlook. Factoring in a growth slowdown The impact of these feed into our equity CMAs and inform our asset preferences by offsetting the boost from lower equity prices. Our estimate of where interest rates may get to has moved higher and the short-term path has steepened as discussed. Higher short-term rates mean a higher discount rate for equities – a drag on valuations that diminishes our expected returns. Also, the near-term outlook for corporate earnings growth has worsened. The chart on the bottom left shows that current earnings are not fully reflecting the deterioration in the underlying growth picture, in our view. We see current consensus earnings expectations as too optimistic and expect downgrades ahead. Higher risk premia We have also modestly increased our estimate of the five-year ahead equity risk premium (ERP). We prefer the ERP as a valuation gauge over PE ratios, as the ERP takes into account both the price earnings in the year ahead and interest rate outlook. PE ratios only consider price and year-ahead earnings. Our prior expectations of the level of ERP in 5 years time were partly informed by historical data from 1995 onwards – the period of the Great Moderation. This is no longer an accurate benchmark for the future, in our view as it does not consider the new regime. Our revised estimates for the U.S. are shown on the chart on the right below. We now assume an ERP of about 4.2% for the U.S. vs. 3.9% earlier. We think this increase in risk premia is justified, with moderately higher volatility over the coming years. Trimming the equity overweight We still prefer equities to bonds in our strategic views, yet trim our stance on equities to a modest overweight of +1. Over a 10-year horizon, we expect some of the market factors roiling equities to wash out. We expect central banks to live with some inflation after the damage to growth and employment from fighting supply-driven inflation starts becoming apparent. We believe that pivot will ultimately be supportive of equities. Yet we also do not expect that central banks will cut rates back down to stimulative levels as inflation is likely to stay stubbornly above their targets. Our lower expected returns for equities – and trimmed overweight – reflects these dynamics. A similar dynamic is at play in growth private markets such as private equity. Valuations here are slow moving, yet are not immune to higher interest rates. We stay modestly underweight. Download PDF report '"

       "  'content': ' We lay out how our strategic asset views are positioned for a new regime of greater macroeconomic and market volatility. The Great Moderation is over The Great Moderation, a period of steady growth and inflation, is over, in our view. Instead, we are in a new regime of heightened macro volatility driven by production constraints - due to post-Covid supply disruptions and labor shortages in the near-term and structural forces such as a bumpy net-zero transition and a rewiring of global supply chains amid geopolitical tensions over a longer horizon. This warrants higher risk premia – the compensation investors want for holding assets - for bonds and equities. We ultimately expect central banks to live with inflation, but only after stalling growth. The result? Persistent inflation amid sharp and short swings in economic activity. End of the Great Moderation Volatility of U.S. GDP and CPI, 1965-2022 Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and Labor Department, with data from Haver Analytics, August 2022. Notes: The chart shows the standard deviation of the annualized quarterly change of U.S. GDP and the Consumer Price Index. More frequent strategic view changes The new regime means strategic views – that typically remain relatively stable – will likely need more frequent adjustments. The investment playbook will also be significantly different than the past. A higher risk premium and worsening macro backdrop lowers our expected equity returns, spurring a reduction in our overweight to the asset class to only a modest preference. We overweight investment grade credit In fixed income, the rising rate environment, higher inflation and elevated debt loads means we go maximum underweight nominal developed market (DM) government bonds. We prefer inflation-linked bonds (now maximum overweight) and credit, particularly investment grade, where we turn overweight for the first time in two years. Overall in duration, our preference for IG credit and inflation-linked bonds offsets our underweight nominal government bonds. Higher risk premia ahead We have adjusted our medium-term estimates of the risk premia for equity and credit markets to better reflect the wider range of macro outcomes ahead. Our new estimates are modestly higher than prior ones reflecting our view that a more volatile world should mean investors demand more compensation to take on risk. Our prior estimates were based on historical prices through the great moderation. We don’t see current levels of macro volatility to persist – yet we don’t see it falling back to pre-pandemic levels. Bumpier net-zero transition factored in Our capital market assumptions (CMAs) incorporate our best, current estimate of how the net-zero transition will unfold. We have revisited our assumptions around the transition in this update yet acknowledge there is great uncertainty around this. A key takeaway of our ongoing work is that we see a bumpier transition than before – manifesting as supply shocks and regional divergences – as economies and sectors such as energy and transportation are reshaped. The upshot: more macro volatility. We will update our views on the transition and strategic investment implications in a paper in coming months. Access all our portfolio construction work on our hub. The new regime is a riskier one than the Great Moderation, in our view. That means investors should demand more compensation for taking the same levels of risk – higher risk premia. Our CMAs and strategic views had already been positioned for a high inflation risk premium – most directly via an overweight to inflation-linked bonds and a long-standing underweight to nominal developed market government bonds. In our latest update, we incorporate the impact of a higher – currently unpriced equity risk premium – that lowers our expected risk-adjusted equity returns at a 10-year horizon. A higher equity risk premium and deteriorating macro backdrop trims our overweight to DM equities to a modest one at +1. We still have a strategic preference for equities for the long term as we see central banks ultimately pivoting to living with some inflation. Another notable change this quarter is that we turn overweight public credit for the first time in more than a year. The colored boxes on the chart on the right below shows our latest strategic preferences compared to our prior views shown by the dots. We think strategic allocations - that typically would have remained relatively stable in a world of low macro and market volatility – will likely need more frequent adjustments.

Over a strategic horizon, we expect structural forces such as a bumpier transition to net zero and a rewiring of global supply chains to contribute to supply shocks. Second, record debt levels mean small changes in interest rates have an outsized impact on governments, households and companies – limiting how far central banks can go in raising rates and forcing them to live with some inflation. Third, we find the politicization of everything – from inflation to climate change to geopolitics – raising the risk of oversimplified policy solutions in a more complex world. The growth-inflation trade-off Policymakers face a tougher trade-off between growth and inflation today than when demand shocks dominated. Monetary policy was more effective in influencing demand – and helped to suppress volatility. It is less suited to supply shocks, in our view, meaning policymakers may face a worse mix of higher output or inflation volatility. Reining inflation comes at a much greater cost to growth. Preserving growth comes with much higher inflation. That is at the crux of the problem central banks are grappling with currently. We see most developed market central banks taking policy into restrictive territory, but ultimately pivoting and choosing to live with some inflation as the cost to growth becomes clear. That’s why we think the volatility of each will be higher in the new regime. We expect inflation to remain above target in the U.S. over the next 5 years. The choppy restart following Covid offered a glimpse of the long-term impact structural supply shocks may have on the economy. A notable example is the net-zero transition, as we now believe it will be bumpier and a bigger drag in coming years than we previously anticipated. There is great uncertainty around how the conundrum facing policymakers gets resolved. Central banks have turned increasingly hawkish to counter elevated inflationary pressures, sparking a sharp repricing higher of expected policy rate paths. That rhetoric has intensified since our last update as policymakers continue to respond to the politics of inflation. We no longer expect central banks to pause at neutral – the level of rates that is neither restrictive or stimulative – even though tighter policy does little to address supply-driven inflation. It does mean growth over the near term suffers as interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy bear the brunt. In our CMAs, we further raise our estimates for the policy path across major central banks that feed directly into our expected returns across asset classes, most notably fixed income. Upgrading credit to overweight We see nominal yields in five years’ time significantly higher than current levels. That repricing is a valuation drag on expected returns for nominal government bonds. We go back to a maximum underweight stance on the asset class and prefer to take duration risk in credit, particularly higher quality investment grade. We turn overweight both IG and high yield (HY) credit in developed markets for the first time in more than two years. Widening credit spreads Widening spreads – partly a reflection of growth fears – have pushed up our expected returns and brightened the risk-reward for credit. Slowing economic growth is a valid risk – yet we don’t expect the kind of deep recession that would cause defaults and downgrades to explode higher and damage the case for credit. In that backdrop, we think higher spreads and higher government bond yields – both drivers of our expected credit returns – make credit an asset class with attractive income potential. An anticipation of wider spreads and higher yields had kept us underweight public credit. Both are now at more attractive levels – and spreads are no longer a drag to returns. The chart on the left below shows how valuation, the impact of higher spot yields and higher expected income have pushed up our expected returns across DM credit markets. We see spreads compressing over a strategic horizon as the economy stabilizes following central bank pivots. We see spreads compressing over time, yet not immediately. Higher inflation Finally in fixed income, we return to a maximum overweight on inflation-protected government bonds. Why? We believe markets are once again underappreciating the persistence of higher inflation. The U.S. inflation breakeven rate fell sharply over the second quarter from its March 2022 peaks – see chart on the right below – due to broader risk-off sentiment and as recession fears took hold. The drop has taken market-implied pricing well below our estimates for forward inflation expectations over the next five years – the yellow dot in the chart. Global equities struggled over the second quarter. Markets have recovered some losses in recent weeks, yet the broad MSCI World index of DM equities is still down 15% year-to-date, according to Refinitiv data as of Aug. 8, 2022. Typically, falling prices would mean we would expect to see higher expected returns as, all else equal, valuations become more attractive. Yet, all else has not remained equal. Markets have grappled with the difficult trade-off that central banks face between choking off growth via sharply higher rates or living with supply-driven inflation. Tough rhetoric from central banks on inflation suggests interest rates – across most of DM – are likely to move past neutral into restrictive territory. Beyond tighter monetary policy, the implications of the energy price shock – particularly painful for Europe – and China’s strict Covid lockdowns are weighing on the near-term economic outlook. Factoring in a growth slowdown The impact of these feed into our equity CMAs and inform our asset preferences by offsetting the boost from lower equity prices. Our estimate of where interest rates may get to has moved higher and the short-term path has steepened as discussed. Higher short-term rates mean a higher discount rate for equities – a drag on valuations that diminishes our expected returns. Also, the near-term outlook for corporate earnings growth has worsened. The chart on the bottom left shows that current earnings are not fully reflecting the deterioration in the underlying growth picture, in our view. We see current consensus earnings expectations as too optimistic and expect downgrades ahead. Higher risk premia We have also modestly increased our estimate of the five-year ahead equity risk premium (ERP). We prefer the ERP as a valuation gauge over PE ratios, as the ERP takes into account both the price earnings in the year ahead and interest rate outlook. PE ratios only consider price and year-ahead earnings. Our prior expectations of the level of ERP in 5 years time were partly informed by historical data from 1995 onwards – the period of the Great Moderation. This is no longer an accurate benchmark for the future, in our view as it does not consider the new regime. Our revised estimates for the U.S. are shown on the chart on the right below. We now assume an ERP of about 4.2% for the U.S. vs. 3.9% earlier. We think this increase in risk premia is justified, with moderately higher volatility over the coming years. Trimming the equity overweight We still prefer equities to bonds in our strategic views, yet trim our stance on equities to a modest overweight of +1. Over a 10-year horizon, we expect some of the market factors roiling equities to wash out. We expect central banks to live with some inflation after the damage to growth and employment from fighting supply-driven inflation starts becoming apparent. We believe that pivot will ultimately be supportive of equities. Yet we also do not expect that central banks will cut rates back down to stimulative levels as inflation is likely to stay stubbornly above their targets. Our lower expected returns for equities – and trimmed overweight – reflects these dynamics. A similar dynamic is at play in growth private markets such as private equity. Valuations here are slow moving, yet are not immune to higher interest rates. We stay modestly underweight. Download PDF report '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Read details of our midyear outlook: The Great Moderation is over The Great Moderation, from mid-1980s until 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, was a remarkable period of stability of both growth and inflation. We were in a demand-driven economy with steadily growing supply. Borrowing binges drove overheating, while collapsing spending drove recessions. Central banks could mitigate both by either raising or cutting rates. That period has ended, in our view. Bracing for volatility This new market environment has echoes of the early 1980s. We are bracing for volatility in this regime. Central banks are rushing to raise rates to contain inflation that’s rooted in production constraints. They are not acknowledging the stark trade-off: crush economic growth or live with inflation. The Fed, for one, is likely to choke off the restart of economic activity - and only change course when the damage emerges. We see this driving high macro and market volatility, with short economic cycles. Equities would suffer if rate hikes trigger a growth downturn. If policymakers tolerate more inflation, bond prices would fall. Either way, the macro backdrop is no longer conducive for a sustained bull market in both stocks and bonds, we believe. We see higher risk premia across the board and think portfolio allocations will need to become more granular and nimble. Living with inflation We think we will be living with inflation. For all the noise about containing inflation, we see policymakers ultimately living with some of it. We remain overweight equities and underweight government bonds in long-term portfolios. We expect investors to demand more compensation to hold long-term bonds in this new regime. We see a high risk of growth stalling and reduce equities to underweight. We now prefer to take risk in credit because we don’t see contained default risk. Positioning for net zero We see the bumpy transition to net-zero carbon emissions shaping the new regime – and believe investors should start positioning for net zero. We think investors can be bullish on both fossil fuels and sustainable assets, as we see a key role for commodities in the transition. Yet our work finds that changing societal preferences can give sustainable assets a return advantage for years to come. Ready to shift views We stay pro-equities on a strategic horizon but are underweight in the short run. Biases built up during the Great Moderation, like buying risk asset dips, won’t work as well as before, in our view. A new regime of greater macro volatility, shorter cycles and more volatile markets, means a dynamic approach to portfolio positioning. Our conviction is that portfolios will need to change more quickly. Ready to shift views Our conviction is that portfolios will need to change more quickly. For example, on equities and credit, central banks slamming on the policy brakes as inflation remains persistently above target could make us more negative.

       "  'content': ' We see Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a significant and surprising escalation of the conflict. We now know what we are contending with: the start of a protracted stand-off between Russia and the West. We deplore the human toll and tragedy all this may bring. The key macro impact in the short run is higher inflation via rising energy prices, in our view, complicating central banks efforts to curb price pressures. The invasion appears to target regime change in Kyiv and will likely trigger punishing sanctions by the U.S. and its allies. This may include cutting off Russia’s main banks from the world’s financial system and restricting key technology exports. We could also see Western arms and materials supporting any Ukrainian insurgency – and Russian cyberattacks and disinformation. Risk assets have fallen sharply, with U.S. and European equities hitting new lows for the year. Government bond yields have declined but not as much as might be implied by the equity selloff. This shows their diminished appeal as diversifiers in the inflationary environment. Russian assets have been hit hard on the prospect of more sanctions. The key macro impact from this event, in our view, is fast-rising energy prices. This will exacerbate supply-driven inflation - while delaying and raising its peak. We think central banks will need to normalize policy to pre-Covid settings to curb inflation, and they will find it tough to respond to any slowdown in growth: policy rates are headed higher. Central banks ultimately won’t go beyond normalization to rein in inflation, in our view, because of high costs to growth and employment. In other words, we think central banks will live with inflation. They may face less political pressure to contain inflation as the conflict becomes an easy culprit for higher prices. We believe this will allow central banks move more cautiously as they raise rates, especially the European Central Bank. Our conclusion: The invasion has reduced the risk that policymakers slam on the brakes – or that markets think they will. Investment implication: The key to watch is the interplay of energy prices and inflation expectations. We dialed down risk-taking this year because we saw a risk of confusion amid a confluence of unique events: the economic restart, spiking energy prices and new central bank frameworks. This confusion has played out: Market expectations of rate hikes have become overly hawkish, in our view. We were prepared to take advantage of market dislocation, but are holding off on making changes to our tactical views until the interplay dynamics become clearer. For now, we keep favoring equities over bonds at lower risk levels than last year. Download PDF '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Our strategic asset preferences for equities over nominal government bonds and credit have been positioned for the new market regime we flagged in our 2022 Global Outlook. We see this regime being driven by investors demanding greater compensation, or term premium, for the risk of holding government bonds and our expectation for higher inflation in the medium term. It reinforces a significant reallocation to equities and away from government bonds that has only just begun, in our view. Our latest strategic views We are now in a fundamentally different market regime from the one we’ve seen over the past decade – one driven by higher supply-driven inflation and a more muted cumulative central bank response to such inflation. This macro backdrop – already baked into our capital market assumptions (CMAs) - reinforces a significant asset reallocation in favor of equities and away from fixed income that our strategic asset preferences have already been positioned for. The dislocations in markets so far in 2022 - driven by an adjustment to this regime shift and by near-term confusion stemming from the unusual economic restart, a surge in inflation and new central bank frameworks – presents long-term investors with a strategic opportunity to bump up equity allocations. We add to our developed market equity overweight following their year-to-date selloff and keep our strong underweight to nominal government bonds. See the chart on the left below. The speed of the market’s repricing upwards of the path of interest rate hikes over the next two years – most notably at the Fed but also to varying degrees across other major DM central banks such as the European Central Bank (ECB) – has been striking. The swiftness of the move has sparked confusion – exacerbated by mixed messages from central banks themselves – about what is guiding their policy. The Fed appears to have effectively abandoned its prior guidance that it would wait until it reaches its “broad and inclusive” full employment objective before starting to raise rates. In doing so, it has lost an anchor for policy expectations and contributed, in our view, to the speed of the market’s repricing of the rate path over the next two years. The pace of the repricing has weighed on equity markets, adding to some investors’ concerns around slowing growth and potential erosion of profit margins as inflationary pressure build. The confusion gripping markets can persist over the near-term – indeed, the repricing of the ECB\\'s rate path occurred after 24 January cut-off date for this CMA update. On a strategic horizon of five years and beyond, we believe fundamentals will matter more, spurring us to take advantage of the recent selloff add to our DM equity overweight. It is not strange that the central banks should want to get back policy to neutral and away from emergency measures – and do so quickly – as the restart does not require stimulus. Yet we believe what we are seeing for the Fed in particular is a re-timing of rate rises and not a re-assessment of how far rate rises are going to go this cycle. The chart on the top right contrasts market pricing of short-term (orange line) and long-run rate expectations (yellow line). Market expectations and the Fed’s own projections of cumulative rate hikes – key for asset valuations - have remained stable at historically low levels through the repricing at the front-end. We believe central banks will ultimately choose to live with inflation. Why? The unusual supply-driven nature of inflation means fighting such inflation aggressively with monetary policy will dent growth while doing little to address the underlying cause. This suggests a muted policy response that keeps real rates relatively low and supportive of risk assets. We expect supply triggered inflation to last far beyond the restart. Why? We see the transition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 completely rewiring the global economy and altering supply-demand patterns across sectors. We believe bond markets are not fully pricing in higher medium-term inflation. We expect higher term premium to become a driver of higher nominal yields. This is also why we prefer and remain strongly overweight inflation-linked bonds. Our central case is for nominal yields to continue to rise. Yet they remain close enough to lower bounds to limit the effectiveness of DM government bonds as portfolio ballast. Meanwhile, China continues to stand out. In contrast to DM economies, the policy stance in China has become markedly dovish as policymakers look to counter the economic hit from new virus strains amid the Winter Olympics. We remain modestly overweight Chinese assets in strategic allocations, and like Chinese government bonds in particular for both returns and diversification. Download PDF report An opportunity to add to equities Confusion over the restart, new virus strains, supply-driven inflation and new central bank frameworks has been evident in markets through January. Alongside the pace of rates pricing, this confusion has weighed on equity markets. The swift repricing in the path of short rates has sparked a surge in bond yields and triggered a rotation away from long-duration sectors such as tech that have dominated equity markets over the past decade. For long-term investors, we see this selloff as a mispricing to exploit by adding to equity positions. We believe equity markets are not making the distinction between the repricing in the near-term path of policy rates – which has been sharp yet has a limited impact on long-term expected returns – and the muted change in long-run rate expectations – far more important for equity valuations and returns. The value of an equity is based on the future value of cash flows – the vast majority of that value lies beyond 2022 or 2023, in our view. This means a higher discount rate in those years but not further out should, all else equal, have only a limited impact on long-term equity valuations. In our CMAs, certain key sectors – such as tech and communications - have become more attractive now than they were prior to the equity market sell-off, and our higher allocation to equities overall reflects a larger share of these sectors in our portfolios. In a whole-portfolio context, the valuation argument has implications beyond public equities. In our paper the core role of private markets in modern portfolios, we emphasized that prevailing market conditions should dictate the split between public and private assets rather than a pre-determined split. We determine the attractiveness of private versus public markets independently every quarter. The relative attractiveness of public equity, and, as we’ll discuss in the next page the relative unattractiveness of public fixed income influences our private market allocations. Today, we prefer to access credit exposures via private markets, and on a relative basis, prefer to access equity exposures publicly. Importantly, however, our relative underweight to private equity should not be seen as a recommendation to sell private equity allocations or abandon long-standing funding programmes. We believe private growth assets should play a sizeable role in any institutional asset allocation eligible to hold such assets. Yet in a hypothetical scenario of designing a portfolio from scratch today, we believe such assets would play a lesser role than they did due to the increased attractiveness of public equity. The bottom-line: The bigger picture is little changed amid the volatility of the past month. The sum total of expected rate hikes - key for asset valuations - has not moved much. That means publicly traded equities have become even more attractively valued than they were after their recent drop, leading to our upgrade. We find the public equities particularly appealing relative to growth private markets where the repricing we describe above has not occurred, in our view. Download PDF report Lower bounds still matter for bonds Nominal government bonds have become less expensive since our last update, as yields have backed up. Yet we remain convinced in our underweight to nominal DM government bonds even after the backup in yields we have witnessed in recent months. Why? Two key reasons: first, we see yields as being close enough to effective lower bounds that bonds’ role as portfolio ballast remains challenged and second, we believe we are seeing a re-assessment of fixed income risk in markets as term premium – or the extra compensation investors demand to hold long-term bonds – is restored. We believe there is further to go on the term premium, keeping our central estimate for expected returns low. Given the move in yields, a valid question is whether they are sufficiently far away from effective lower bounds for them not to matter. Perhaps yes, for investors focused on short time horizons. But for investors building strategic horizon portfolios, history and our estimates uncertainty around the path of returns going forward suggest not. Take the outlook for the U.S. Treasuries all-maturities index. When building a 10-year portfolio, the question \\'do lower bounds matter?\\' effectively means asking what is the probability of falling around 150 basis points - the current average yield to maturity of the Bloomberg U.S. Treasuries index, as of 24 January 2022 - over the next 10 years. Data from Federal Reserve of St. Louis shows that since 1969 yields were 150 basis points below their starting levels five years later on 36% of the days over the whole period even after accounting for any structural decline in rates over time. See table below. Even when we adjust this data to allow for the structural decline in yields in recent decades, the number is 26%. See the table below. That means based on history alone, we would expect more than a quarter of our return pathways to be impacted by the lower bound over a 10-year horizon.

February 2022.Notes: The table shows the percentage of days yields fell below their starting level by 150 basis points or more from their starting levels over 5- and 10-year rolling periods But historical performance can be thought of as just one of multiple unknown pathways that asset prices might take going forward. The market environment of past few months has underscored the importance of incorporating uncertainty in return estimates – and sharply brought into focus the idea that historical performance may not be much of a guide for future returns. Our approach to portfolio construction is based on achieving resilience in worst-case outcomes. We simulate thousands of potential return pathways around our central estimate and provide a “term structure” of returns over different time horizons – from five years out to the long-term. In our simulations, these worst-case outcomes are ones where risk assets such as equities do poorly. This could be, hypothetically, a recession - a plausible scenario over a 10-year year period. This is precisely when portfolio ballast will be needed. Yet it is in these same simulations where lower bounds on bond yields may be breached as yields fall again in response to accommodative monetary policy that has been employed to counter downturns and market shocks. See our April 2019 paper Understanding uncertainty for more on our approach to incorporating uncertainty. The bottom line: we keep our strong strategic underweight to government bonds even after the recent back-up in yields. Our central case assumes yields keep rising – driven in part by the return of term premium. See the chart below on the right for our estimates of where U.S. Treasury yields will be in five years’ time relative to market estimates. That means our expected returns remain low relative to other asset classes, and the ability of government bonds to act as risk-off diversifiers due to proximity of yields to effective lower bounds over a strategic horizon.

       "  'abstract': 'We assess how different the path of interest rates and the outlook on China would need to be to challenge our asset views',\n",
       "  'content': \" Our key themes and the asset recommendations they imply – an overweight in developed market (DM) equities, a high-conviction underweight in DM nominal government bonds and a strong overweight in inflation-linked bonds - have been playing out for the last 18 months. DM equities and inflation-linked bonds have done well while nominal government bonds' performance has been poor. It is appropriate to question whether these views still hold after the strong performance and uncertainty among market participants around inflation and the path ahead for interest rates, plus concern about China’s growth slowdown. We see our themes persisting yet feel it is prudent to stress test our views to gauge just how different the outlook needs to be from our base case to shift our asset preferences. Overall strategic direction Our strategic tilts – a broad preference for equities over credit and inflation-linked bonds over nominal government bonds – have remained stable amid the unusual economic restart. Strong corporate earnings and low real rates have supported equities that remain close to record highs. Yet recent months have been marked by significant volatility - particularly around the interest rate outlook sparked by market uncertainty around central banks' reaction function amid rising inflation, but also around China's slowing growth and supply shocks that have seen energy prices soar globally. Our core investment themes have helped us to cut through the confusion of competing market narratives. We see the central bank policy and nominal yield response to higher inflation to be the most muted it has been in decades. In our view, the U.S. Federal Reserve would already be raising interest rates at current levels of growth and inflation under its old policy framework, highlighting how their reaction function has changed significantly. In our view, key to the path for U.S. interest rates will be how the Fed interprets its full employment mandate. We see interest rates climbing gradually yet real yields staying relatively low – a positive for risk assets and a negative for nominal government bonds. We push back against the notion that higher spot inflation indicates a repeat of 1970s-style stagflation. The growth outlook remains robust, in our view. We believe the unusual supply shocks tied to the restart are driving higher inflation. We expect these imbalances to resolve over the next year yet see some persistence in price pressures – a reflection of central banks’ increased tolerance of inflation overshoots. We estimate U.S. inflation averaging just under 3% over a five- to 10-year horizon. Such a view is already embedded in our CMAs. The expected shift to a higher medium-term inflation regime supports the strong overweight to inflation-linked bonds as shown in the chart below. Our expected returns for inflation-linked bonds are much higher than nominal government bonds due to our views of higher medium-term inflation and the lower valuation drag from yields grinding higher. We see low-yielding nominal bonds as poor portfolio ballasts. We remain overweight Chinese assets. We see Chinese assets as an important source of returns for most globally diversified portfolios. China portfolio allocations have come under scrutiny amid a regulatory clampdown. Our base case already assumes policymakers tighten control of the economy over time as China’s leadership balances social and economic objectives. We assume materially higher uncertainty and higher risk premia for China compared to developed markets in our CMAs. We recognize the path won’t always be smooth but believe investors are being rewarded for the inherent risks. Current allocation to Chinese assets in global portfolios, on average, point to an overly negative economic outlook in coming years, in our view. The new nominal, alongside our two other investment themes - China stands out and the journey to net zero - continue to underpin our views. We believe part of the volatility we have seen over the past quarter is a reminder of the unusually wide range of economic outcomes that potentially lie beyond the restart. It is prudent amid such a macro backdrop to continuously stress test asset preferences should our investment themes unfold less benignly that we currently expect. In this paper, we dig into alternative scenarios involving a spike in nominal yields and a gloomy outlook for China. Over the summer, a supply crunch sparked intense volatility across the energy sector, providing a glimpse of what a disorderly climate transition might look like. Our climate-aware CMAs are predicated on a smooth transition to net-zero world by 2050, which is mildly inflationary and baked into our strategic views. The implications of a disorderly transition present a complex challenge – one we will address in a more detailed research in coming months. What rate path cuts our equity view? The new nominal remains core to our strategic views. The Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have adopted new policy frameworks that explicitly allow for greater inflation tolerance than in the past. We believe this means that interest rates and nominal yields will stay lower for longer. It also points to higher inflation over the medium-term – something that is already baked into our views. In this environment of low real rates and moderately higher inflation, we prefer equities over nominal bonds. In recent months, markets have challenged central banks’ new frameworks by testing their resolve to not lean against the higher spot inflation fuelled by the restart. Surging spot inflation pulled forward market expectations of the first policy rate hikes – or the lift-off - across central banks, notably the Fed. Yet we believe what matters is not the timing of the first hike: a somewhat earlier lift-off is less important than the cumulative increase in rates over the hiking cycle. To really challenge our new nominal would require a steeper policy rate path, more akin to past hiking cycles. We test an alternative scenario of policy rates rising sooner and further to try to estimate just how much higher the path needs to be tip the balance against equities. Our valuation models suggest that short-term cash rates would need to be 80 basis points higher than our current estimates to turn us neutral on equities. The chart on the left below shows 3-month U.S. cash rates with their expected path in our base case and alternative scenario. The alternative scenario would require the Fed react more like it has in the past – and abruptly end the joint monetary and fiscal policy revolution that has brought about massive debt levels and a higher tolerance for inflation. A sharp rise in the path of short rates would hit equity valuations. Our scenario would see our U.S. equity expected returns down around 2%, with a greater impact felt in rate sensitive sectors such as tech that typically have a low equity risk premium (ERP) – our preferred valuation gauge that accounts for earnings growth as well as the rate outlook. Less rate sensitive sectors such as energy that have higher ERPs would fare better. In the alternative scenario, our estimate of the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield remains at 2.5% despite higher cash rates. Why? Central bank tightening drives medium term inflation expectations lower, pushing down our break-even inflation estimates relative to current expectations. Potential portfolio implication: The impact on our strategic asset allocation (SAA) preferences is shown on the right chart. Fixed income assets perceived to be higher quality, such as DM government bonds and investment grade credit, become relatively more attractive, as yield curves flatten more than our base expectations. Yet even in this scenario they remain an underweight – just less so. Inflation-linked bonds would be less of an overweight but still preferable to nominal bonds, given the latter’s low returns and reduced ballast role. Current investment stance: We see the kind of spike higher in short-term rates described above as unlikely. Markets are pricing in short-term rates rising to 1.9% by the end of the decade, according to data from Bloomberg as of November 2021. Our alternative scenario is materially above that at 2.4% by end 2030. We maintain our conviction in our new nominal theme that supports our preference for equities. What China scenario hurts our views? We discussed our strategic preference for Chinese assets in detail in our May 2021 paper The role of Chinese assets. Since then we have had more evidence that the long-term direction of travel for policy in China is likely to be more state intervention. China’s regulatory clampdown on certain industries this year that has weighed on growth and rattled investors in this context is one stark example. In our view, policymakers’ goal with these actions - alongside a relatively hawkish monetary and fiscal policy stance - is for a more equitable economy and higher quality growth, instead of mere quantity. Such a significant shift comes with clear risks to growth. Yet we believe global investors’ low average allocations to China today suggest they hold a particularly pessimistic view on the outlook, prompting a stress test of our views. In our stress test, we assume China derails economically in the form of a sustained, sharp slowdown. We looked to the 2015-16 China growth shock and market reaction as an indication of what such a scenario would look like. Back then, an equity market shock was accompanied by yuan devaluation and widespread fears of a significant growth slowdown. In our alternative scenario we assume such a backdrop persisting over a longer time period – think a Japan post-1990 scenario with an aging population and anaemic growth, rather than a 2008-style crisis. The left chart below shows our expected returns for the MSCI China equity index in the alternative scenario compared to our current expectations. We believe such a backdrop would ultimately bring China bond yields lower - narrowing the yield gap with the U.S. and Europe. It would also drive down Chinese equity valuations as investors demand higher equity risk premium to compensate for greater uncertainty amid slower economic growth that erodes earnings growth. The effects would not be confined to China - a slowdown in China growth would be a drag on global equities and push global bond yields lower, in our view. Potential portfolio implication: The chart on the right shows the potential impact on our asset views. The biggest allocation impact would be a reduction in global equities given the serious, negative implications on global growth and corporate earnings prospects from sharply slower growth in China. The increase in Chinese government bonds appears counterintuitive yet falling yields in an adverse economic outcome would boost the asset class’ expected returns. Our scenario is not one in which China becomes non-investible – it is one where growth slows. This would dent the risk assets such as equities globally and brighten the appeal of all government bonds rather than just those issued by China. Current investment stance: We believe investors’ allocations to Chinese assets today seems like they are already positioned for a scenario where China’s economy derails as described above. The hawkish policy stance and impact of tighter regulations has already spurred a significant underperformance of Chinese and equities and credit markets in 2021. Valuations for Chinese equities have diverged sharply from the U.S. Our estimate of the equity risk premium – our preferred valuation gauge that takes into account prevailing interest rates – stands at 8% for China compared to 4.3% for the U.S, as of end-October. A higher ERP for Chinese equities is warranted in our view given uncertainties, yet we see current valuations painting an overly pessimistic picture. Download report \"},\n",

       "  'content': ' A decade late, a trillion short This US$1 trillion figure is based on numerous studies of climate finance needs in EMs. Estimates vary depending on the underlying assumptions and given the uncertainties around modelling climate impacts. A 2018 study puts the investment requirement for EMs excluding China at between US$0.4 trillion and US$1.4 trillion per year, while a June 2021 report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), World Bank and World Economic Forum states that over US$1 trillion per year will need to be invested in EMs through 2030 to get them tracking towards net-zero emissions by 2050. Yet these estimates largely focus on the supply-side cost of climate mitigation – that is, the measures to tackle the process of climate change. If we also consider the cost of adaptation (measures to protect against and limit the damage of realized and future climate change) and demand-side costs (such as reducing energy consumption), the figure would be significantly higher. How big is the shortfall? Even taking a conservative view of the investment need, current financing is nowhere near sufficient. In 2020, investment in decarbonization in EMs (excluding China) amounted to just US$150 billion per year – only a sixth of what’s needed. See the chart above. Some of this money comes from EMs themselves, and some is mobilized by DMs via official bilateral and multilateral channels and the private money they leverage. In 2019, DMs mobilized just US$80 billion, according to the latest OECD data. This puts DMs still some way off from meeting their commitment as part of the 2010 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). Their goal is to mobilize, from both public and private sources, at least US$100 billion per year by 2020. Even meeting this pledge won’t get us anywhere close to the at least US$1 trillion we believe is needed. Make-up of DM contribution Breaking down the 2019 DM mobilization total, the vast majority of it (over 80%) was public money, and the overall volume has grown somewhat in recent years, largely delivered in the form of loans. Only a small share of this public money – US$16.7 billion in 2019 – was actually grant-equivalent financing fueled by budgetary resources. This type of financing is crucial because it can be used to directly buy down EM risk and green technology premia. Private money mobilized by DMs declined slightly in 2019 versus 2018 – from an already low level. In 2019 less than 20% - or US$14 billion – came from private sources. But the investment needs of at least US$1 trillion per year are too high to be met by taxpayers alone. The private component needs to be massively scaled up – and rapidly, in our view, given the potential consequences of an underfunded green transition in EMs for the whole world. Unlocking private capital Mismatched resources Distribution of resources and assets in emerging and high-income economies Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, IMF, World Bank, MSCI, using data from Haver Analytics and Refinitiv DataStream, October 2021. Note: The chart shows the shares in different concepts of EMs (excluding China), China and high-income economies (i.e. rest of the world). EMs are those classified as low and middle-income countries by the World Bank. For market cap, this is the share of each group/country in total world stock market capitalization measured by the MSCI world stock market capitalization, as of 4 October 2021. For CO2 emissions, this is the share of each group/country in total world CO2 emissions in 2018 (latest data point). For GDP this is the share of each group/country in world GDP measured using Purchasing Power Parity exchange rates, as of 2019 (before the Covid shock). For population this is the share of each group/country in world population in 2020. Private capital to fund the transition is theoretically plentiful. But current strategies to entice it are not working at sufficient scale and speed. Why not? The EM investment landscape is viewed as high risk – to the point that many private investors are deterred – or prohibited – from investing in EMs. See the chart above. But these are currently undiversifiable risks: the institutional and structural reforms required to de-risk individual countries – though underway in many cases – will not happen quickly enough. No amount of clever financial engineering can address these risks, and existing approaches by multilateral organizations have not succeeded in mobilizing private capital at scale. Measures not working Existing measures to mitigate this risk have not been effective in bringing in private finance at the scale needed. Limits on current efforts to attract private capital Institutional/structural reform takes time DFI risk mitigation measures are deployed on too small a scale Public money is too targeted on funding individual projects instead of reducing broader risk Market failures, e.g. unequal access to information, impede capital flows Existing grants or grant-equivalent finance provided by developed economies is too targeted on funding individual projects – rather than being used to mitigate risks more broadly and crowd in private investment. If the pace and scale of climate flows is to pick up as it needs to, either the input of public budgetary resources needs to increase radically, or the amount of private capital that public support can mobilize will have to rise by an order of magnitude – or a combination of the two. We believe budgetary resources of at least US$100bn a year – about six times current outlays – need to be committed by countries that can afford it. The amount could be reduced if development finance institutions(DFIs) can mobilize more private capital with each dollar of public support than they currently do. But given the timescale and DFIs’ difficulty in mobilizing private capital at scale, we believe the starting point is for governments to significantly scale up budgetary allocations. Averting future losses This money should be used to de-risk projects on the understanding that it might not be seen again, rather than be spent directly on projects looking for a return. This may be seen as a huge cost for DMs, but we believe it represents an essential investment. US$100 billion per year – or US$2 trillion cumulatively over the next 20 years – is only a fraction of the losses averted by a successful climate transition. We estimate a cumulative loss in global economic output of nearly 25% to 2040 – equivalent to more than US$21 trillion of 2019 GDP. Once we move past 2040, we expect the size of avoided economic damages for actions taken now to be substantially higher. To further put this figure in context, US$100 billion per year over 20 years is only a fraction of the US$9 trillion (as at July 2, 2021) of domestic DM fiscal support provided since 2020 to cushion the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Applying the same willingness to roll out material support for climate finance could help close the funding gap in time. Design features Significant de-risking lies at the heart of any solution to mobilize private capital – and there is no way to do this without massively scaling up direct budgetary resources, in our view. In practice, mobilization could come through a number of mechanisms - and we see a number of key design features of measures that we believe will help unleash private finance at scale. De-risking Public budgetary resources can play a critical role in de-risking investment opportunities. Many of the undiversifiable risks such as country risk, could be reduced via this type of public finance – potentially unlocking substantial pools of private finance currently prevented from being invested in EMs generally. But some changes are needed to the current system in order to achieve this – for example increasing grant-equivalent funding for first loss arrangements – in which the development or public finance institution agrees to take on part of the risks of an investment, including being the first to take on losses in the event of default. Facility-level financing Budgetary resources have greatest power to scale up this de-risking by providing finance at a facility level, rather than on a project-by-project basis. This could happen in several ways, for instance by using public funding as seed capital to set up a green investment bank in an EM economy, or to fund a mechanism such as an auctioned carbon price floor which can issue an investment instrument that is bankable and which supports decarbonization without investors taking on project completion risk. The bottom line A system that meets these key requirements can help ensure that the catalytic promise of significantly higher public budgetary resources can be realized, to ultimately deliver funding on the scale and at the pace needed to fund the green transition. The examples discussed above provide some illustrations of how this could happen. In practice, a combination of measures will be needed. We have focused on measures that can be scaled up to deliver quickly, but maximizing impact per dollar spent will require significant changes to existing multilateral and bilateral delivery channels. It may even entail a complete overhaul of current institutions or the creation of new ones. That’s for governments to determine, but in any event, action needs to be taken without delay. '},\n",

       "  'content': \" The volatility we have seen just in the two months since we published our midyear investment outlook reflects - in our view - the unusually wide range of divergent yet plausible economic outcomes that potentially lie beyond the post-Covid restart. We stand by the broad themes we outlined in our outlook and hold conviction in our asset views. The overall direction of our strategic tilts has remained stable amid a noisy macro backdrop. We still tilt towards equities over credit and government bonds, even after the strong rebound we have seen since the equity market’s lows of March 2020. Overall strategic direction The overall direction of our strategic tilts has remained stable amid a noisy macro backdrop. Market sentiment has swung between extremes since our last update in May as fears of runaway inflation gave way to concerns over deflationary spirals in the matter of a few months. These swings reflect - in our view - the unusually wide range of significantly divergent yet plausible economic outcomes that potentially lie beyond the economic restart. Having an anchor is important in such an environment. We maintain high conviction in our new nominal investment theme that implies low real yields - a positive for risk assets – and see market overreactions may create opportunities to readjust portfolios. The new nominal, alongside our two other investment themes – China stands out and the journey to net zero – continue to guide our views. Our strategic tilts are summarized in the chart below. Our broad asset preference We maintain a higher allocation to equities than we would through typical periods of rising inflation as we believe the policy revolution has diminished the risk of a sharp rise in discount rates hitting valuations across asset classes. We continue to prefer equities over credit and government bonds. We already preferred DM equities over EM. This preference has been further bolstered by two factors: first, incorporating climate change in our return expectations brightens the relative appeal of DM indices whose sector composition is better aligned to the green transition and second, a more granular, sectoral approach to approach to equity allocations that we have now adopted allows us to lean more heavily into sectors such as tech and healthcare that we favor. In fixed income, We prefer inflation-linked bonds to DM nominal government bonds as portfolio ballast. The lower-for-longer environment boosts the appeal of private markets for eligible investors, in our view. We believe the low level of long-term bond yields is inconsistent with both restart dynamics and our macro outlook. We stick to our underweight in nominal DM government bonds and believe the direction of travel for nominal yields is higher. We stay overweight equities on a strategic horizon partly on the view that valuations do not look stretched in terms of the equity risk premium – our preferred gauge that considers the low interest rate implications of the new nominal. We also see earnings growth driving returns, though the pace of earnings growth will likely moderate as the growth spurt of the activity restart settles into an economic expansion. China stands out The strategic case for Chinese equities has come under scrutiny amid signs of a regulatory clampdown on certain private industries. The recent volatility underscores, in our view, the risks around policy implementation. This is a key reason why we maintain a high level of uncertainty around our mean return estimates on Chinese equities. At the same time, the income and portfolio ballast properties of Chinese government bonds remain attractive at a time when DM government bonds ballast properties have been diminished. The potential role Chinese assets can play in strategic portfolios highlights a key tenet of our broader investment views: portfolio resilience will likely be driven by deliberate diversification across countries, sectors and regions rather than broad asset class correlations. Journey to net zero Finally, the path to net-zero carbon emissions now has a starting point and potential destination – but there is no clear roadmap yet for getting there. Some of the coming changes may be abrupt – and add to supply and demand disruptions among commodities. We see opportunities along the way, particularly in private markets as we see private capital playing a key role in financing the climate transition. We see twists and turns in the journey to a more sustainable world. Our base case is for an improved outlook for growth and risk assets versus a do-nothing scenario yet acknowledge that uncertainty around this is very high. Monitoring the transition is key as we see it affecting the risk premia of all assets, in our view. Reflecting the granular approach we discuss are likely to vary significantly between different types of investors. Governance costs, constraints and other complexities could be limiting factors to how granular portfolios can go. Policy revolution The policy revolution in developed economies– marked by historic monetary and fiscal policy stimulus – has meant a surge in debt to record levels. Rising inflation coupled with continued fiscal spending from governments in the Western world means that we expect a revival in term premia – the extra compensation investors demand for holding long-term government bonds. The upshot: we see a steeper yield curve than markets expect as shown on the left chart below. Markets have also grappled with the Federal Reserve’s new framework. In June, investors extrapolated strong economic data amid the restart and assumed a policy reaction more akin to that of previous cycles to price in a much faster pace of Fed interest rate hikes than the Fed’s own – and our – projections. By the end of July, such expectations were tempered significantly and had moved down closer to the Fed’s view, as shown on the chart above on the right. One important implication of the new nominal for our CMAs is that our expectation of the path of short-term interest rates remains lower than what markets are currently pricing in. We expect a similar dynamic to play out in the euro area where the European Central Bank (ECB) has adopted a symmetrical 2% inflation target. We had already been assuming that sluggish inflation dynamics would spur a greater tolerance for inflation overshoots from the ECB, and a later lift-off in policy rates than the Fed. New nominal We discussed in our December 2020 paper A new playbook for higher inflation how longer-dated DM nominal government bonds remain challenged in their ability to provide portfolio diversification. Breaking down portfolio exposures across the yield curve in terms of short-dated bonds versus longer-dated bonds allows for a more deliberate expression of our macro framework than simply taking a view on the entire asset class. Our new nominal theme sets our expectations of the yield curve apart from what markets are currently pricing in two ways. First, we expect policy rates to remain lower for longer and second, we expect a steeper yield curve in the future than what market prices currently imply. Our estimates of nominal short-term yields stay below what the market is pricing meaning we see more return potential for shorter-dated assets than what markets expect as we see less room for yields to fall. Deliberate yield curve views Another aspect of new nominal is that we see medium-term – a five-to-ten-year horizon – inflation expectations as too low. The overhaul of central bank reaction functions along with supply-demand frictions as a result of re-globalisation and the green transition, will push inflation moderately higher in our view. Switching to both shorter (1-10 year) and longer (10+ year) indices from all-maturity government bond indices, we can express our new nominal theme in portfolios. We prefer a higher allocation to longer-dated inflation linked bonds compared to a market-cap weighted allocation in an all-maturity index given our expectation of higher medium-term inflation – something we believe markets may be underappreciating. Structural changes We discussed in detail in our May 2021 paper The role of Chinese assets how the acceleration of structural trends in the aftermath of the Covid shock helped further crystalize our strategic preference for Chinese assets. China’s regulatory clampdown on industries such as tutoring and tech has since unnerved global investors in recent months. Recent developments are an example of why the risk premium for investing China is higher than most DMs. Yet we do not believe this is the time to step away from China. The broader strategic case we have laid out for Chinese assets – that they should play a larger role in strategic allocations that they currently do – remains intact, in our view. Longer term, China remains a distinct pole of global growth, and we see it as an investment destination separate from both EM and DM. Our preferred strategic allocation to Chinese assets – both equities and bonds – remains higher than that suggested by their weight in broad global benchmark indexes. We recognize implementation of our asset views will differ across investor types and geographies, depending on objectives, constraints and regulation. Regulations in review One concern has been whether recent regulatory actions are evidence of underlying “anti-market” intentions that contradict rhetoric from policymakers aimed at enticing foreign capital. We do not believe this is the case. Why? For one, actions elsewhere – such as in credit markets where authorities are encouraging a greater tolerance of credit defaults – pave the path toward a clearer market pricing of risk. Second, authorities’ reaction to market volatility was telling. The Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, made up of the country’s most senior leaders, removed certain previously used hawkish regulatory language from their July meeting statement – a sign, in our view, of cognizance of the market impact and desire to calm sentiment. Lastly, we believe policymakers want to encourage more friendly foreign and private capital conditions as they see it key to meeting growth targets and developing onshore funding markets. The case for Chinese government bonds, in particular, is undimmed and the asset class remains a key strategic overweight in a low-yield world, in our view. The charts below highlight their appeal. They show that the income potential in Chinese government bonds relative to duration risk is considerably higher than DM peers – a key driver of our higher expected returns. Differences in yields across sovereign bond markets can be due to factors such as perceived sovereign risk, expectations for domestic economic conditions and monetary policy and market supply and demand. Strategic positioning The post-pandemic policy revolution in developed economies that has led to a surge in debt to record levels stands in contrast to what we are seeing in Asia’s largest economy. China is pursuing a more orthodox policy with both real and nominal interest rates positive and somewhat high when compared to global peers. We see China as an appealing investment destination for global investors searching for yield in bond markets because of this distinct policy approach. Why is China doing this? In our view, China believes that reducing risks in its financial system by limiting borrowing binges and moving to a somewhat more efficient allocation of capital is fundamental for it to achieve its ambitions in the coming years and decades. Restart dynamics The economic restart has driven high sector dispersion, due to the near-term economic environment and structural trends accelerated by the pandemic, in our view. The vaccine-led activity restart unfolding globally is very different from a typical business cycle recovery. There is no investment playbook to follow as this kind of forced shutdown on a global scale, a massive fiscal and monetary policy stimulus and the ongoing restart has little historical precedent. Rising earnings growth expectations have helped offset the impact of higher equity prices on our overall expected equity returns. In our latest CMA update, our expected equity returns in the latest update have fallen only slightly for the U.S., Europe, UK and EM ex-China – a reflection of restart dynamics. We see the sharp spurt in activity underway as the global economy emerges from lockdowns settle into an expansion around trend growth further down the line. The chart on the left below illustrates this pattern – earnings growth expectations beyond the immediate forward 12-month period is expected to moderate across regions, according to the latest Refinitiv data. Regional equity allocations have helped capture some of the divergences. A sectoral approach Yet one important trend under the surface is that sectoral divergences are even more stark than regional ones. We are introducing sector-level CMAs for the U.S. and Europe that we believe can help better exploit unfolding sectoral shifts in the post-Covid world. We see both medium- and long-term reasons for this. On the former, the restart has been marked by significant divergences in sector performance. The chart on the right shows how the latest forward earnings estimates for sectors within the MSCI USA and MSCI EMU stack up against each sectors’ pre-Covid estimate in December 2019. It shows how sectors in the U.S. – except energy – have mostly surpassed their pre-Covid estimates while peers in the euro area are just reaching those levels now, showing the broadening restart and how Europe is now picking up the baton from the U.S. There is significant divergence between sectors within the same region. Part of this can be attributed to a rebound in cyclical sectors geared to growth yet there is more to it. Some sector dynamics can be explained by the unique nature of the pandemic shock. Service-based, high-contact sectors suffered through the lockdowns and are still lagging goods-based sectors. The restart is now fuelling high demand in some areas due to pent-up demand and a savings surplus but also causing supply shortages. Crucially, we see this as different to a typical cyclical rotation as growth expectations have been revised up, yet interest rates have stayed low, supporting valuations of 'long duration' sectors such as tech. Journey to net zero The pandemic has turbocharged the shift toward sustainability. We believe high carbon emitting sectors such as energy and utilities are highly exposed to transition risks that will push their cost of capital up and profitability down. The energy sector’s recent strong performance reflects the near-term rebound in activity, in our view, as strong demand and supply shortages push up crude prices. We believe this may be short-lived as the transition to net zero leads to peak demand. Our return estimates for energy drop off sharply over the medium term. On the other hand, we like health care and IT on a strategic horizon. Firstly, we see tech and healthcare as aligned with the green transition. Secondly, both benefit from the low short rate environment we expect as part of the new nominal. We expect strong earnings growth, not just in the near-term but to persist beyond the restart. Finally, we do not see healthcare and tech as expensive versus our estimate of their long-run fair value based on the equity risk premium. Download report \"},\n",

       "  'content': ' Our strategic asset positioning still tilts towards equities over credit and government bonds, even after the strong rebound we have seen since the equity market’s lows of March 2020. We like developed markets (DM) and China within equities, helped in part by the impact of incorporating climate change in our return expectations. We prefer inflation-linked bonds to developed market (DM) nominal government bonds as portfolio ballast. The lower-for-longer environment also boosts the appeal of private markets for eligible investors. A key reason for staying the course on our strategic asset views is that we see our new nominal investment theme – that calls for a more muted response interest rates to higher inflation than in the past – playing out. The new nominal has been key to our pro-risk tactical investment views. Yet taken alongside the powerful, joint monetary-fiscal policy revolution that has dominated the Covid-19 response, it has significant implications for our strategic views as well. We see central banks, notably the Federal Reserve, leaning against sharp long-term yield rises. The upshot: we see a lower path of short-term interest rates compared with our previous expectation and current market pricing. This affects all our long-term return expectations. A disconnectExpectations for U.S. policy interest rates, 2021-2026 Forward looking estimates may not come to pass.

Notes: The chart shows expectations for the federal funds rate, the Fed’s policy target. Market pricing is based on futures on the U.S. dollar Secured Overnight Financing Rate. We use the median forecast in the March 2021 Survey of Market Participants by the New York Fed. The BII assumption is part of our economic projections in our capital market assumptions. The Fed median dot plot comes from the January 2021 Summary of Economic Projections. We update our capital market assumptions – the building blocks of our portfolio construction framework – to the end of the first quarter of 2021 to incorporate the implications of the new nominal more fully and reflect the changes in market prices and fundamentals. We see the equity risk premium – our preferred gauge of equity valuations that accounts for changes in interest rates – as in-line with historical averages, suggesting the asset class is not overvalued. By contrast, credit spreads are close to their tightest levels relative to history, underscoring our preference for equities over credit. We don’t agree with the narrative that higher long-term yields signal bad news for equities. We believe rising yields should not matter for equity valuations if they are due to the return of term premia – the compensation investors demand for holding riskier longer-term bonds – rather than expectations of a higher policy rate path. We believe higher term premia in a backdrop of a strong economic restart do not challenge equity valuations. Markets appear skeptical about the Fed’s ability to hold its ground and keep interest rates pinned near zero. Accelerating growth and higher inflation have caused a large gap to open up between current market pricing and consensus expectations for the path of interest rates. Such a gap suggests the federal funds rate, the Fed’s policy rate, would start rising much sooner than Fed officials’ own projections. Markets have pulled forward their rate hike expectations to late 2022 – a time frame we believe is inconsistent with the high bar the Fed has set. We believe the Fed is likely to start raising rates later than markets expect and more gradually than markets expect. The chart below contrasts our expectations with previous rate hiking cycles. More gradual rate hikesPast and expected U.S. rate hike cycles Forward looking estimates may not come to pass. Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, Federal Reserve and Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with data from Refinitiv Datastream, May 2021. Notes: The chart shows the path of Fed rate hike cycles since the 1990s (dotted lines) measured in quarters since the first hike and normalized to 0% at the point the Fed started raising rates for comparison purposes. The actual Fed policy rate at the start of each cycle were as follows:2.96% in 1993, 4.68% in 1998, 1% in 2004, 0.12% in 2016. The orange line shows our assumed path over the next 3 years based on our views on Fed’s policy framework and macro assumptions. Why the disconnect between the market and our expectations? We see two reasons. First, investors may be over-extrapolating from near-term growth and inflation data amid the powerful economic restart. We view the Covid shock as more akin to a natural disaster followed by a rapid “restart” – instead of a traditional business cycle recession followed by a “recovery.” That implies the huge near-term growth spurt will be transitory. And second, we believe many are still wedded to the central bank’s old policy framework and may underestimate the central bank’s commitment to meeting its inflation goals. The new nominal has implications beyond policy rates and the path of short-term interest rates. We believe the rise in nominal government bond yields – the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jumped 80 basis points over the first quarter – is justified. Rising yields reflect both financial markets and the Federal Reserve waking up to the reality of the strong, vaccine-driven activity restart – more powerful than a typical recovery – and large-scale fiscal spending becoming more concrete. Yet so far the rise in long-term U.S. Treasury yields – while quick – is more muted than typically seen in response to rising inflation and growth expectations in the past. Such market behaviour is typical of the new nominal dynamic that we expect to prevail in coming years. Lower for longerU.S. spot yield curve vs market and BlackRock estimates Forward-looking estimates may not come to pass. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream, May 2021. Notes: The chart shows the spot U.S. yield curve (green line) as of March 31, 2021 and estimates of what the curve might look like five years from now. The market-implied projection (yellow line) is derived from the spot rate using the forward rate formula. The dotted orange line shows our assumption of the shape of the yield curve in five years time. The interaction of monetary and fiscal policy is critical. We believe there is greater willingness from the central banks to quell rising government bond yields. Why? We see a strong incentive for policymakers to keep interest costs low to ensure the viability of surging debt burdens that were necessary to cushion the impact of the Covid shock. Even as long-term yields have risen this year, we see them topping out in five years’ time at lower levels than previously assumed. Their proximity to the effective lower bound, or the natural limits to how far long-term yields can drop, curtails the ability of DM nominal government bonds to act as portfolio ballast. Also, the blurring of monetary and fiscal policy – without proper guardrails – raises the risk of diminished central bank independence and uncontrolled fiscal spending. The relatively relaxed attitude to rising debt stems in large part due to low prevailing interest rates. In the US, debt is poised to reach a record level of 135% of GDP based on IMF forecasts, twice as high as in the 1990s, but financing costs are only half what they were then as a share of GDP. Eyes on the debt burdenU.S. interest cost estimates, 1990-2025 Forward-looking estimates may not come to pass. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream, May 2021. Notes: The chart shows : Interest payments are calculated as the difference between U.S. general government net borrowing and U.S. general government primary deficit and expressed as a share of nominal GDP. The first scenario in red shows hypothetical interest costs assuming that the effective interest rate on the existing debt stock rises quickly to 2.5% and holds there over the next four years. The second scenario shows the hypothetical impact of a more gradual rise to 2.5% by 2025. Hypothetical data results are based on assumptions applied retroactively with the benefit of hindsight, were not made under actual market conditions and, therefore, cannot completely account for the impact of economic risk. Actual results may differ. The spike higher in bond yields this year has spurred comparisons with the 2013 “taper tantrum” when a suggestion that the Fed would slow its asset purchases stoked fears of a stalling economic recovery, leading to a sharp selloff in equities. The chart below shows how the drivers of this year’s yield rise are very different. In 2013, it was a sharp repricing of the Fed’s projected rate path via higher real rates. Now it is a higher term premium – or the premium investors typically demand to hold riskier long-term government bonds – driven partly by greater uncertainty around inflation. This dynamic of low short rates alongside a powerful restart underpins our preference for equities over debt. Not stretchedBlackRock estimate equity risk premium vs. history Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream, April 2021. Notes: The chart shows the equity risk premium and historical ranges since 1995 for major equity regions based on respective MSCI indices. We calculate the equity risk premium based on our expectations for nominal interest rates and the implied cost of capital for each equity markets. Our belief that the move in bond yields is driven by rising term premia rather than expectations of higher policy rates is one reason why we don’t see the current rise in yields as detrimental to equities. Changes in term premia reflect duration risk and do not have direct implications for equity prices, in our view. Structural shifts such as persistently lower interest rates make it difficult to judge the signals from traditional metrics such as price-to-earnings ratios. Such metrics may suggest equities are overvalued yet fail to take into account the prevailing interest rate environment. We use the equity premium (ERP) – or the expected return of equities over the risk-free rate – as our preferred gauge. This approach helps us assess valuations across different interest rate environments and also accounts for the growth outlook. The chart above shows our estimates of the ERP for major equity markets relative to their history since 1995. All, expect Japan, are still above the historical median, underscoring our view that equities do not appear overvalued. See our global outlook for more. We believe a term premium tantrum in the current environment would imply a further shift away from allocations to DM government bonds– and could reinforce the strong performance of cyclical equity sectors rather than destabilizing broader risk assets.

       "  'content': \" A stronger narrative China has emerged from the pandemic with renewed confidence – just as it did after the global financial crisis (GFC). Growth has bounced back to trend and foreign direct investment inflows are surging, according to the data from China's National Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Commerce. A stable economic backdrop has made authorities more comfortable emphasizing structural reforms over short-term growth targets, in our view. This points to greater emphasis on reducing risks in the financial sector, pursuing self- sufficiency in energy and reducing dependency on imported technological know-how. The narrative around China has shifted away markedly, in our view, from concerns about the health of its financial system and credit- fueled growth. Its economic and market outperformance through yet another global shock has brought sharply into focus the important role Chinese assets can play in bringing resilience to strategic portfolios. It has deepened our overweight stance on Chinese assets. Such a view was in place due to their diversification potential and relatively better expected returns for Chinese assets over peers. As the chart shows, China and Asia ex-Japan are projected to continue increasing their global GDP share while the GDP share of North America, Europe and Japan weakens further. The acceleration of structural trends in the aftermath of the Covid shock has helped further crystalize our views on Chinese assets. The joint monetary-fiscal revolution in developed economies has seen interest rates plummet, lengthening the lower-for-longer outlook. Chinese bonds as portfolio ballast The income and portfolio ballast properties of China government bonds look relatively attractive at a time when developed market government bonds ballast properties have been diminished. Global debt levels have risen sharply as Western governments have put in place a fiscal impulse many multiples of what was seen during the GFC even as the overall estimated economic loss from the Covid shock is expected to be a fraction. China’s overall debt levels should be viewed in this context, in our view. The economy has rebounded without adding huge new debt – an important evolution that speaks to the focus on the quality of growth over the quantity, What we considered: China’s rise China’s presence on the global stage is becoming ever more prominent. Yet its representation in benchmark indexes is far below its economic and technological importance, as shown in the first chart. Trade volumes and direct investment inflows - both at record highs – show little sign of U.S.- China trade tensions impeding the country’s rise.

Notes: The left chart show shows China’s representation across major macro and market metrics. We use the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index and MSCI ACWI equity index as proxies for global bonds and equities respectively. The right chart shows each region’s combined share of global GDP on a purchasing power parity basis. A nuanced picture The path forward for U.S.-China relations may be more predictable under U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration compared with recent years. The U.S. and China have committed to working together to tackle climate change, suggesting some re-engagement on key global issues. Yet we believe the strategic rivalry between the two powers – across multiple dimensions – is likely to persist. Economically, China has an ambition to double GDP by 2035 – surpassing the U.S. and firmly shifting the center of gravity for global growth to Asia in coming years. See the chart above on the right. The wide-ranging plans touch many flash points in the U.S.-China relationship, with the Covid pandemic amplifying each country’s focus on economic. Secure supply chains and self-sufficiency in critical technologies and industries are a strategic priority and could drive a rewiring of global trade. Intensifying competition between the U.S. and China on key technologies such 5G and semiconductors is one example. “Dual circulation” strategy A key component of China’s strategy is “dual circulation.” First floated by China's leadership in May 2020, dual circulation is the concept of both increasing the resilience of the economy by a greater emphasis on supply and demand within the domestic economy while also increasing the country's economic links with the rest of the world. Recent trade deals indicate changing future trade patterns rather than declining trade - between China and its regional partners through RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) and further afield with the European Union. RCEP – covering 30% of global GDP - brings China closer to South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia. We could increasingly see countries aligning with the two poles of growth – U.S. and China led – and even being forced to choose between the two. China’s linkages with global markets are poised to deepen – via greater index inclusion and openness to foreign investors – at the same time economic linkages are being remapped. For decades, the world was moving in a more globalized direction. Broadly, this meant that geographic exposures, such as country and region selection, were becoming less important. We believe that a considered approach to geographical diversification becomes increasingly important in a world where the almost one-way direction of travel for globalization has been interrupted. The splits across countries and regions - particularly the U.S. and China - and sectors such as technology are growing in prominence. This is true both from a return perspective - taking exposure to both engines of growth, as well as from a risk and diversification perspective - holding a greater balance of assets that are less correlated to each other. The potential role Chinese assets can play in strategic portfolios highlights a key tenet of our broader investment views: portfolio resilience may well be driven by deliberate diversification across countries, sectors and regions rather than broad asset class correlations. Growing return dispersion between regions due to a bifurcated world with the U.S. and China at opposite poles – see the Engines of growth chart – creates more return diversification potential. A “quality” revolution What does “quality” entail? In the context of China’s growth outlook, we believe it covers at least three areas highlighted by President Xi Jinping in January 2017 at the World Economic Forum: the environment, economic wellbeing and stability of the financial system. In other words, China wants to become a more productive economy with each unit of incremental GDP generating proportionately less pollution, inequality and financial risk (debt). This is the road to quality growth. We believe China will prioritize reforms that emphasize these goals as policymakers view them as mission-critical in achieving a more prosperous and powerful country. Debt and private markets Both the West and China are undergoing a policy revolution – one of our key themes since the Covid-19 shock struck. But crucially, these revolutions are very different. Western economies are blending large fiscal and monetary stimulus, with the hope that the scale of such policy support can help achieve societal aims beyond a narrow inflation goal. In China, we believe the revolution is a sincere effort to move away from an overriding focus on the quantity of growth towards a greater focus on the quality of growth. Western governments have put in place a fiscal impulse many multiples of what was seen during the GFC even as the overall estimated economic loss from the Covid shock is expected to be a fraction. We believe China’s overall debt levels should be viewed in this context. China’s quality revolution and the structural changes we see unfolding in the economy has important implications for the fast-growing market for private assets. The dual circulation strategy, a push to become carbon neutral by 2060 and urbanization are long-term transformations that may not be appropriately captured by assets listed and traded on public markets today, in our view. Investors wanting to participate in such transformations may want to consider doing so via private markets but should be cognizant of the risks involved. Tapping into private markets Private markets may be better placed to offer targeted exposure to emerging domestic trends in China. A Bain & Company Asia-Pacific private equity survey found investors saw the biggest growth in funding businesses driven by digitization. We see real estate and private equity and credit growing rapidly in China. See charts below for details.

The chart on the right shows the sectors in which institutional private market investors see the biggest growth in China according to a Bain & Co 2021 survey. Sustainability in focus Sustainability will be a powerful driver of global returns in the medium term, in our view, and ever more central to all investment decisions. There are many aspects to sustainability – and the weight placed on each differs across investors. As a result, the overall assessment of China is investor specific. We consider both the current status as well as the direction of travel when it comes to assessing China’s sustainability credentials. We see improvement on several fronts – notably its environmental commitments – but recognize there is further to go, and commitments need to be realized. Our asset return assumptions (CMAs) incorporate the impact of climate change on long-term asset returns. Popular wisdom has it that investing in China and being climate-friendly are at odds. We disagree. China’s commitment to a net- zero economy by 2060 was an important step – not just for its own economy, but for global progress toward climate goals. China’s economy stands to benefit the most among major nations from a “green” transition to a more sustainable world, in our analysis, than a scenario of no climate action. In our CMAs we focus on the E in ESG. Why? There is wide recognition of the importance of climate change for economic and social outcomes. There is consensus on the measurement of an entity’s contribution to climate change via carbon emissions. These factors suggest climate change will be a driver of returns at the broad market level. See our paper Climate change: Turning investment risk into opportunity of February 2021 for more. Our overweight to Chinese assets versus benchmark indexes does not change after taking into account the impact on climate change on expected returns. The composition of Chinese equity indexes is better aligned with the transition to a low-carbon economy, in our view. For instance, China’s industrial sector has around a 39% share of China GDP. Yet industrials only make up 5% of the MSCI China index, which has a higher concentration in the ‘greener’ sectors, such as consumer discretionary (34%) and consumer services (20%). Incorporating sustainability in the investment process requires distinguishing between current conditions and potential opportunities. The focus of China’s leaders on achieving a carbon-neutral economy will likely filter through to corporate priorities and objectives. The BlackRock Investment Stewardship team engages with Chinese companies – just as in other jurisdictions – to strengthen sustainability disclosures: see its framework for dealing with broader ESG issues in its global engagement priorities for 2021. We recognize that disclosures have a long way to go. Yet we believe this should not detract from the fundamental case for Chinese assets in strategic portfolios. Some concerns on sustainability will likely persist. We expect social and governance issues to take on greater prominence in the wake of Covid-19. We see sustainability rising beyond the mere labels of E, S and G. That brings along complications that often relate to lack of proper data. There is some ways to go on achieving adequate disclosures – but we see this as a potential area of evolution and progress in coming years that should be closely watched. Risk and return The Chinese economy and markets have evolved rapidly and so views on risk and return cannot be anchored entirely on the past. Our case for “why China” is not based on better economic growth expectations. In fact, our estimates of Chinese growth are modest relative to history – we estimate annual real GDP growth on average will be less than 4% in a decade. Yet our expected returns look at much more than regional GDP. Market-based earnings estimates, the outlook for profit margins, valuations and the path of domestic rates have a greater bearing on our expected returns than growth. Our estimate of the equity risk premium – our preferred metric to gauge valuations - stands at 7.3% for the mainland stock market compared with 4.3% for the U.S., pointing to attractive risk-reward for the former. This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise -or even estimate -of future performance.

We expect Chinese onshore listed equity returns to outpace broad EM and DM aggregate indexes, driven mainly by higher earnings growth and higher payout ratios than the past due to demands from international investors and pressure from the Chinese securities regulator. We expect Chinese yields to rise, yet on a risk-adjusted basis see returns more attractive than comparable developed and emerging market government bonds. Our five-year annualized expected returns for Chinese government bonds are higher than for U.S. Treasuries. See the chart above. For expected returns on Chinese bonds to equal the expected return on U.S. Treasuries, we would need to see China government bond yields to rise sharply from current levels – an unlikely event, in our view. Above benchmark allocation We believe a neutral starting point allocation to China for most investors is significantly greater than that implied by benchmark indexes today. We are overweight Chinese assets, particularly government bonds, relative to their weight in broad global benchmark indexes. See our regional tilts in the geographical breakdown chart.

Indexes are unmanaged, do not account for management fees and one cannot invest directly in an index. Strategic opportunity We believe investors, on average, are underinvested in Chinese assets – even below what we believe to be neutral levels suggested by current global benchmarks. An internal survey of portfolio trends in EMEA conducted by the BlackRock Portfolio and Analytics Solutions group over the course of 2020 showed the average explicit allocation to China was just 0.3% to equities and a mere 0.05% for fixed income. The implied exposure via broader emerging markets allocation was also relatively slim – under 3% for equities and under 0.5% for bonds. Chinese equities are about 5% of the MSCI ACWI equity index and bonds comprise about 7.5% in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index. Overall foreign ownership in onshore Chinese assets is low even after the recent surge in inflows as index inclusion has picked up. Offshore investors own 4.3% of the domestic A-share market and 2.9% of onshore bonds as of the end of 2020, according to data from the People’s Bank of China. We believe global investors should look to up allocation as access opens up.

Avoiding damages from climate change The popular notion that tackling climate change comes at a net cost to the global economy is wrong, we believe. Avoiding climate-related damages will help prevent economic deterioration and improve risk-asset returns, in our view. We see the “green” transition to a carbon-neutral world rewarding companies, sectors and countries that adjust and penalizing others. That is why our capital market assumptions (CMAs) – long-run estimates of risk and return – now reflect the impact of climate change. Estimates in this area are highly uncertain, yet our framework is designed to account for this. We will refine this framework as we monitor the evolution of the “green” transition. We focus on climate because we believe a broad consensus around its impact and measurement suggests that climate change is fast becoming a key driver of asset pricing. Our updated CMAs are driven by sectoral views, with exposure to climate risks and opportunities a key determinant. We see technology and healthcare benefiting the most from that perspective, and carbon-intensive sectors such as energy and utilities lagging. This in turn increases our strategic preference for developed market (DM) equities, at the expense of high yield and some emerging market (EM) debt. Why? The composition of DM equity indexes better aligns with the climate transition, with large weights of technology and healthcare companies, less vulnerability to transition risks and lower carbon intensity. Equities also can better capture potential opportunities of the green transition, as bonds are capped in their capital appreciation. Sectors that face structural challenges due to rising climate awareness, such as energy and utilities, are more prevalent in high yield and EM debt indexes. Download full PDF report The green transition The two scenarios to compare from this perspective: a transition to a low- carbon economy in which policies to fight climate change are enacted, and a no-climate-action scenario with no actions to limit damages. A commonly held notion is that tackling climate change has to come at an economic cost. We think that’s wrong. We assume the global economy transitions to a lower carbon path consistent with Paris Agreement goals. The positive effect of this transition rests on a gradual phasing in of carbon taxes, green infrastructure spending consistent with the IMF’s recommendation, and subsidies on renewable energy. If none of these actions are taken to mitigate climate change, we estimate a cumulative loss in global output of nearly 25% in the next two decades. The stylized Accounting for climate change chart illustrates the potential difference between the two paths. We focus on the \"E\" (environmental) of ESG in our updated CMAs. Why? First, there is wide recognition of the importance of climate change on economic and social outcomes. Second, there is consensus on the measurement of an entity’s contribution to climate change: carbon emissions. Carbon emissions have become a widely enough adopted indicator of sustainability for investors to be a driver of repricing at the broad market level. We see insights into S (social) and G (governance) as key sources of potential returns through security selection, rather than as systematic drivers of returns. We will consider incorporating them in our framework once consensus around their impact and availability of consistent data improve in coming years. Getting into the macro We believe macro variables will be different in a world that is transitioning to a sustainable future. Such changes mean sustainability affects everything that goes into forming a view on long-term asset class returns. We see changes in so-called risk premia for all asset classes – the compensation investors require for holding them. Repricing effects The price investors are willing to pay for sustainable assets is changing. The BlackRock 2020 Global Sustainability Survey of September 2020 found 425 institutional investors planned to double their sustainable assets under management in the next five years to 37%. We see this as a tectonic shift toward sustainable assets. Changing investor preferences will spur a climate change-led repricing due to the falling cost of capital for sustainable assets. These assets will generate higher returns than traditional peers as a result, in our view. Investors are just starting to respond to the structural shift, suggesting it is not yet in the price. Once this repricing phase has passed, we believe this channel will eventually no longer be a boon for “greener” assets’ expected returns. Back to the fundamentals Climate change and policies to mitigate it will affect profitability across sectors, we believe. This will have knock-on effects on other variables such as credit default and downgrade assumptions. No one knows yet what a low-carbon world will look like. Climate projections are highly uncertain. This is due to the complexity of modeling the dynamics and myriad dependencies between climate and carbon emissions, economic variables and mitigation policies. Our framework allows us to systematically monitor key metrics and the evolution of the green transition, and we plan to adapt it accordingly. Our approach explicitly accounts for uncertainty - highly relevant for climate change that will have varying but highly uncertain impacts over time. We believe this approach lends itself well to the structural transformation taking place. '},\n",

       "  'content': \" Most ignore the effects of climate change in their financial projections. We believe this is not right. Climate change is real and cannot be ignored by investors. Climate risk is investment risk, and we see it is as a historic investment opportunity. Our capital market assumptions (CMAs) – a core input to building portfolios – for the first time, explicitly reflect the impact of climate change on the investment landscape. This is one of a set of actions we are taking to prepare investors for the global transition to a net zero emissions economy by 2050 or sooner. Pioneering research The commonly held notion that tackling climate change has to come at a net cost to the global economy is wrong, in our view. If no action is taken to combat climate change, the considerable physical damages would imply a lower path of economic growth. Our CMAs reflect our view that the green transition to a low-carbon economy, consistent with the Paris Agreement goals, will deliver an improved outlook for growth and risk assets relative to doing nothing. The chart below shows our estimates of the impact on China – an increasingly important pillar of the global economy and one where the impact of climate change is likely to be significant. Seeing green Estimated GDP paths scenario for China, 2020-40 Forward looking estimates may not come to pass. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, Banque de France, International Energy Agency, OECD, January 2021. Notes: The chart shows our estimated path for China’s GDP over the next 20 years under the two mentioned scenarios. GDP levels are rebased to 100 as of 2020. Underpinning the climate-aware CMAs is our view of an orderly transition that successfully limits climate-related damage. The tectonic shift toward sustainability has gathered momentum over the past year following a series of major climate change commitments by corporations, governments and investors alike, bolstering our conviction in an orderly transition to a low-carbon world. Investors are just starting to respond to the structural shift – suggesting it is not yet fully in the price of assets. The BlackRock 2020 Global Sustainability Survey found that respondents plan to double their sustainable assets under management (AUM) in the next five years – rising from 18% of AUM on average today to 37% on average by 2025. We see climate change and the green transition as persistent drivers of asset returns, and consequently fundamental to making strategic investment decisions. Climate change and policies to combat it flow through our CMAs via three main channels: the macroeconomic impact, the repricing of assets to reflect climate risks and exposures and the impact on corporate fundamentals. A historic investment opportunity Climate change and efforts to curb it will have major economic outcomes, not just far into the future but in the next few decades (Dietz et al., 2020). We have updated the long-term macroeconomic framework that underpins our CMAs. Such an outlook rejects the commonly held notion that tackling climate change has to come at a net cost to society. Globally, we estimate a cumulative loss in economic output of nearly 25% over the next two decades due to the level of GDP being 2.3% lower in 20 years’ time if no climate change mitigation measures were taken. The chart below shows the potential cumulative impact of three factors – avoidance of climate damage, transition costs, and green infrastructure spending – on GDP by 2040. China’s green opportunity Estimated cumulative impact as a percentage of GDP scenario for China, 2020-40 Forward looking estimates may not come to pass. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, Banque de France, International Energy Agency, OECD, January 2021. Notes: The chart shows the cumulative impact on long-term GDP under a green transition relative to a no-climate-action scenario. The bars show the overall estimated impact of three factors – avoidance of climate damages (positive), green infrastructure spending (positive) and costs associated with the transition (negative). The black line shows the estimated net impact. Our estimates of the impact under a climate-aware scenario are based on expected changes in energy consumption including composition, relative carbon and renewables pricing and on potential losses due to global warming. Energy consumption is estimated as a function of GDP and the relative price of energy per the Banque de France's working paper no. 759 titled the Long-term growth impact of climate change and policies. GDP losses from global warming are calibrated on analysis of Impact Assessment Models per W. Nordhaus and A..Moffat (2017). We assume green infrastructure spending programs of 1% of GDP gradually phased out over the next 10 years. Getting into the macro We first incorporate climate damages into our economic projections. The economic losses, associated with rising temperatures, build over time and are more pronounced in some regions than others (Burke et al., 2015). Call this the “no-climate-action” scenario – climate damages occur, but no action is taken to combat it. We then consider a second economic scenario, with policies and innovations that could mitigate climate damages – call this the “green transition” scenario. Specifically, in the green transition we consider the actions needed to ensure the Paris Agreement target of limiting temperature rises to below 2 degrees Celsius is achieved. The green transition is our base case for our updated CMAs and strategic asset class preferences. Economic loss due to climate damages can be largely avoided, in our view, by proactive climate policy action that keeps the global temperature change within the margins of the Paris Agreement through a combination of gradually rising carbon taxes and clean energy subsidies (Burke et al., 2018). We acknowledge the risks to the downside in our green transition scenario. Delays in implementing climate policies could result in a “disorderly transition”. Policy execution will be key: any shortfalls could undermine the policy predictability and credibility, making the energy transition more costly. The “E” in ESG There is wide recognition of the importance of climate change for economic and social outcomes and second, there is consensus on the measurement of an entity’s contribution to climate change - via carbon emissions. Carbon emissions are a widely enough adopted indicator of sustainability for investors to the extent that it can be a driver of repricing at the broad market level. We see insights into S (social) and G (governance) issues as potential sources of alpha impacting security selection, rather than as systematic drivers of returns and so exclude them from our CMAs. Macro variables such as GDP would be different in a world that is transitioning to a low carbon future, meaning traditional risk premia for all asset classes will change. The chart below shows our updated CMAs for selected asset class – the green dots show the mean expected returns in our base case of a green transition and the red dots indicate the expected returns in a no-climate-action scenario. For U.S. equities, our expected returns in a no-climate-action scenario would fall outside the band of uncertainty around our mean estimate, highlighting the potentially large impact from climate change. A meaningful impact BlackRock capital market assumptions for selected assets, February 2021 This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance. Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, February 2021. Data as of 31 December, 2020. Notes: Return assumptions are total nominal returns. U.S. dollar return expectations for all asset classes are shown in unhedged terms,. Our CMAs generate market, or beta, geometric return expectations. Asset return expectations are gross of fees.

There are two sets of bands around our mean return expectation. The darker bands show our estimates of uncertainty in our mean return estimates. The lighter bands are based on the 25th and 75th percentile of expected return outcomes – the interquartile range for more detail read Portfolio perspectives. Beyond the carbon cost In addition to the macro impact, we see the effects playing out through two more channels: Repricing: One consequence of shifting societal preferences is that the price investors are willing to pay for assets perceived to be sustainable is changing, driving differentiated returns. Capital flows toward sustainable assets are a symptom of this phenomenon. Our CMAs now directly reflect our estimates of such a premium. Fundamentals: This channel could be seen as an extension of the macro one. Some companies and sectors are better positioned than others for a transition to a low carbon economy. Corporate behavior will likely respond by adapting to policy and regulatory changes brought about to combat climate change. Profitability across sectors will be impacted. There will be sectoral winners and losers – underpinning why we believe a sectoral approach to sustainable investing is additive to a regional one. The chart below shows the estimated return impact across sectors from both the repricing and fundamental channels. We estimate a 7% annualized return differential over five years between the energy and technology sectors – a significant difference in a world of low expected returns across asset classes. Total return impact Estimated 5-year expected return differential for U.S. sectors in green transition vs, no action, February 2021 This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream and Bloomberg, February 2021. Notes: The chart shows the difference in five-year U.S. dollar expected returns for the highest sub-category of MSCI USA sectors under two economic scenarios - a green transition and a no-climate-action scenario. The difference in expected return is attributable to repricing – the return impact of changing cost of capital - and fundamentals – or the return impact of changing earnings per share growth. Uncertainty is a key element of our framework and is built into our CMAs. No one yet knows what a low-carbon world looks like. The transition may play out over several years, if not decades. We will monitor key trends such as capital flows, policy developments and technological advancements – and the way asset prices respond to them – and look to evolve our framework as new information becomes available. Our portfolio construction approach that explicitly accounts for uncertainty and provides a term structure of returns to capture the time varying impact of climate change lends itself well to the structural transformation we see playing out. Portfolio implications Tactical, or shorter-term, investment decisions will not be sufficient, in our view, to position for the fundamental reshaping of the global economy we see playing out. Positioning portfolios appropriately requires expressing views at the strategic asset level. Like any investment view, the ultimate implementation and sizing of climate change-led views in portfolios will vary depending on an investor’s risk appetite, objectives and eligible universe. Some investors may have to reallocate as much as 10-20% of existing assets. For others, it will be less. See our investor-specific asset allocation breakdowns for more. Our strategic asset preferences for a hypothetical unconstrained, U.S. dollar investor with a 10-year horizon are shown on the chart below and put our asset class views in a portfolio context. They reflect our views on all drivers of long-term asset returns, from the monetary and fiscal policy revolution to structural trends, such as the U.S.-China rivalry and the polarization of global growth. The impact of introducing climate change as an additional driver of returns on asset class views is shown on the right. Tilting toward sustainability Hypothetical U.S. dollar 10-year strategic allocation vs. our equilibrium view, February 2021 This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream and Bloomberg, February 2021. Notes: The chart shows our asset views on a 10-year view from an unconstrained US dollar perspective against a long-term equilibrium allocation described on our capital market assumptions website. The portfolio is illustrative and the allocation above does not represent any existing portfolio and, as such, is not an investible product. The construction of the hypothetical asset allocation is based on criteria applied with the benefit of hindsight and knowledge of factors that may have positively affected its performance and cannot account for risk factors that may affect the actual portfolio's performance. The actual performance may vary significantly from our modelled CMAs due to transaction costs, liquidity or other market factors. Indexes are unmanaged, do not account for management fees and one cannot invest directly in an index. See appendix for full list of index proxies. The most significant impact is a stronger preference for developed market equities at the expense of high yield and emerging market debt. The composition of developed market equity indices better aligns with the climate transition and equities have more ability to capture the upside opportunities from the climate transition. The higher carbon intensity of companies that typically make up high yield and emerging market debt benchmark indices detracts from their expected returns, diminishing their appeal within our overall preferred strategic allocation. Another impact of incorporating climate change in our CMAs - granular investing becomes more prominent in portfolio construction. We believe climate change will drive greater dispersion of returns at a sector level than at the asset class level. We see sectors as the relevant unit of investment analysis and if we allow sector granularity in our portfolio construction, buying assets at the sector level rather than at an index-based regional level, the impacts on strategic asset preferences can be material. We have a strategic preference for inflation–linked government bonds over nominal government bonds. We see the policy revolution driving higher inflation over the medium-term but don’t expect rising inflation expectations to be reflected through higher nominal yields as much as was historically the case. Yet we see a diminished ability of nominal bonds to act as ballast and expect high public debt levels to push yields higher over the strategic horizon. We are strategically underweight credit as we see valuations as expensive on a relative basis relative to equities. Our preference for a strategic overweight to Chinese assets overall is not diminished – and is, in fact, enhanced for Chinese government bonds given the relatively poorer outlook for comparable assets.

       "  'content': ' Read details of our midyear outlook: The Great Moderation is over The Great Moderation, from mid-1980s until 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, was a remarkable period of stability of both growth and inflation. We were in a demand-driven economy with steadily growing supply. Borrowing binges drove overheating, while collapsing spending drove recessions. Central banks could mitigate both by either raising or cutting rates. That period has ended, in our view. Bracing for volatility This new market environment has echoes of the early 1980s. We are bracing for volatility in this regime. Central banks are rushing to raise rates to contain inflation that’s rooted in production constraints. They are not acknowledging the stark trade-off: crush economic growth or live with inflation. The Fed, for one, is likely to choke off the restart of economic activity - and only change course when the damage emerges. We see this driving high macro and market volatility, with short economic cycles. Equities would suffer if rate hikes trigger a growth downturn. If policymakers tolerate more inflation, bond prices would fall. Either way, the macro backdrop is no longer conducive for a sustained bull market in both stocks and bonds, we believe. We see higher risk premia across the board and think portfolio allocations will need to become more granular and nimble. Living with inflation We think we will be living with inflation. For all the noise about containing inflation, we see policymakers ultimately living with some of it. We remain overweight equities and underweight government bonds in long-term portfolios. We expect investors to demand more compensation to hold long-term bonds in this new regime. We see a high risk of growth stalling and reduce equities to underweight. We now prefer to take risk in credit because we don’t see contained default risk. Positioning for net zero We see the bumpy transition to net-zero carbon emissions shaping the new regime – and believe investors should start positioning for net zero. We think investors can be bullish on both fossil fuels and sustainable assets, as we see a key role for commodities in the transition. Yet our work finds that changing societal preferences can give sustainable assets a return advantage for years to come. Ready to shift views We stay pro-equities on a strategic horizon but are underweight in the short run. Biases built up during the Great Moderation, like buying risk asset dips, won’t work as well as before, in our view. A new regime of greater macro volatility, shorter cycles and more volatile markets, means a dynamic approach to portfolio positioning. Our conviction is that portfolios will need to change more quickly. Ready to shift views Our conviction is that portfolios will need to change more quickly. For example, on equities and credit, central banks slamming on the policy brakes as inflation remains persistently above target could make us more negative.

       "  'content': ' Inflation jitters We have been flagging higher inflation since the unprecedented policy response to the pandemic, and this prospect is now driving markets. Our core new nominal theme implies that rising inflation will have more benign market implications than in the past. Central banks are likely to lean against any sharp rises in nominal government bond yields. As a result, real interest rates could stay negative into the medium term. This makes for a positive backdrop for risk assets, and keeps us pro risk with tactical overweights in equities and credit. Yet markets have risen significantly, and we see potential for pullbacks driven by pandemic and vaccine rollout dynamics. Globalization rewired The pandemic has accelerated a rewiring of globalization – with a bipolar U.S.-China world order at its center. We see the new U.S. administration bringing greater predictability in trade policies. Climate is likely to become a central policy priority – and an area for potential U.S.-China cooperation. Yet economic, technological and strategic competition with China looks here to stay – and we believe investors need exposures to both poles of global growth. Rising debt A spike in government debt to record levels – a result of a policy revolution in cooperation between fiscal and monetary authorities – was a necessary response to the Covid shock. It may be politically tough for governments to unwind large-scale fiscal support, and the perceived safety premium for holding government bonds could eventually erode. But we are not concerned about these dynamics in the near term as central banks face pressures to maintain a stable, low-rate environment, keeping a lid on debt servicing costs. Unprecedented response The joint fiscal-monetary policy revolution has delivered historic support to help bridge economies to a post-pandemic world when vaccines become more widely available. We have seen an unprecedented rise in peacetime spending, with discretionary fiscal stimulus far exceeding what we saw after the global financial crisis (GFC). The increase in debt under the current shock also exceeds that of the GFC, even in the absence of large-scale bailouts this time. This has happened against a backdrop of much higher debt levels than a decade ago. As a result, debt-to-GDP ratios have soared to record levels globally. Key risks ahead Fiscal and financial dominance are key risks that could be mutually reinforcing. It could become politically difficult for governments to unwind large-scale fiscal support. And raising interest rates will become more politically fraught for central banks against a backdrop of high debt levels. Even a courageous central bank may end up having to backtrack if an attempt to normalize policy were to result in a “taper tantrum” event that significantly tightened financial conditions. A bipolar world order The pandemic has accelerated a rewiring of globalization – with a bipolar U.S.-China world order at its center. We see the Biden administration as bringing greater predictability and taking a different approach on trade and climate policy. Yet overall tensions with China appear set to stay elevated amid ongoing economic, technological and strategic competition – and we believe investors need exposures to both poles of global growth. Globalization rewired, one of the three key investment themes introduced in our 2021 Global Outlook, is about an acceleration of geopolitical transformations. At its center: a bi-polar U.S.-China world order and the remapping of global supply chains. This is not the same as deglobalization. Clear changes ahead We expect a clear change of tenor and tone in the Biden administration’s foreign policy approach, including a shift to working with allies on key issues: China, Russia, Iran, democracy and cyber security. The Biden administration will likely use alliances with groups of countries to engage China. The nomination of veteran Asia specialist Kurt Campbell to serve the new role of Indo-Pacific Coordinator is a signal of such an approach – as well as the administration’s expectation that intense competition is likely to dominate U.S.-China relations. This is taking place as China has emerged stronger from 2020 with its successful containment of the virus and a lead in the economic restart. It has also signed important trade deals including an investment agreement with the European Union, and a regional free trade agreement with Asia-Pacific nations including Japan and South Korea. Climate action Climate is likely to become a central policy priority under the Biden administration – and an area for potential cooperation in U.S.-China relations amid broader tensions around trade and human rights. Frictions may extend to the financial arena, as evidenced in the forced delisting of some Chinese companies in the U.S. market. We see this as a reason for carefully implementing China exposures, perhaps including consideration of greater direct allocations to China-listed securities over time. Yet how to implement China exposures will depend on investor constraints, including political and legal ones. Portfolio insights Strategically, we see assets exposed to Chinese growth as core holdings that are distinct from emerging market exposures. Tactically, we are overweight Asia ex-Japan equities as many Asian countries have been more effective at containing the virus and are further ahead in the economic restart. Risks to China-exposed assets include China’s high debt levels, currency volatility and heightened U.S.-China conflicts. But we believe investors are well compensated for these. BlackRock’s 2021 investment themes The new nominal We see stronger growth and lower real yields as the vaccine-led restart accelerates and central banks limit nominal yields gains even as inflation expectations climb. Inflation will likely have different implications to the past. Strategic implication: We are underweight government bonds and see equities supported by falling real rates. Tactical implication: Our low rate outlook keeps us pro-risk. We like U.S. equities and prefer high yield for income. The first half of 2021 is likely to be choppy. The pandemic challenges public health and the activity restart, while we see more policy support in the U.S. on top of the recent $900 billion fiscal package. We prefer a barbell approach to risk exposures, with selected cyclicals such as U.S. small-caps and emerging market equities on one end and quality assets including U.S. and Asia ex-Japan equities on the other. We also like tech and healthcare. These sectors can benefit from structural trends turbocharged by the pandemic, in our view, and their strong balance sheets and cash flows help provide some resilience against volatility. Yet we recognize U.S. tech could face challenges from greater regulation and corporate taxes. We remain pro-risk overall, favoring overweights in both equities and credit, but see a potentially bumpy path for asset prices broadly, especially as markets have moved a lot since we published our 2021 global outlook in early December. Globalization rewired Covid-19 has accelerated geopolitical transformations such as a bipolar U.S.-China world order and a remaking of global supply chains, placing greater weight on resilience – even at the expense of efficiency. Strategic implication: We favor deliberate country diversification and above-benchmark China exposures. Tactical implication: We like EM equities, especially Asia ex-Japan, and are underweight Europe and Japan. Turbocharged transformations The pandemic has added fuel to pre-existing structural trends such as an increased focus on sustainability, rising inequality within and across nations, and the dominance of e-commerce at the expense of traditional retail. Strategic implication: We prefer sustainable assets amid a growing societal preference for sustainability. Tactical implication: We take a barbell approach, favoring tech and healthcare as well as selected cyclical exposures. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Joe Biden has won the contest for the White House — an outcome that signifies a return to a near-term market environment dominated by low rates, a hunt for yield and growth stocks. Against a historic backdrop of a pandemic, a victory in the battleground state of Pennsylvania pushed President-elect Biden above the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Risks to the outcome appear remote, and we prefer to look through any market volatility that legal challenges by President Trump may bring. A Democratic sweep — with Democrats also seizing control of the U.S. Senate — looks unlikely, although a runoff election for two Georgia Senate seats in January keeps the race alive. A divided government would constrain the Biden administration’s ability to implement plans for large-scale fiscal stimulus and public investment, tax, healthcare and climate related legislation. We see an increased focus on sustainability under a divided government, but through regulatory actions, rather than via tax policy or spending on green infrastructure. It also would likely signify a return to more predictable trade and foreign policy — even as U.S.-China rivalry is set to stay elevated due to bipartisan support for a more competitive stance. Fiscal policy is critical for preventing permanent economic damage from the virus shock. Some fiscal relief looks possible in the near term during the lame-duck session of Congress, but we see the scope and size of fiscal stimulus and public investment as much more modest than what a united Democratic government might have delivered. We’re monitoring the fiscal response closely, as a premature retrenchment could set back an economic restart that has so far surprised to the upside. Long-term U.S. Treasury yields had ran up ahead of Election Day in anticipation of a Democratic sweep, bringing forward a rise in yields we expect to see in a higher inflation regime in the medium term. The prospect of a divided government removed the accelerant and brought yields down again. A slower upward move in yields bodes well for risk assets, in our view, especially for credit and growth companies that have dominated markets for much of the post-crisis period. Emerging market (EM) assets should perform on improved trade sentiment, we believe, especially in Asia ex-Japan. Many Asian countries have contained the virus and are ahead in the economic restart. We are reviewing our tactical asset views in light of the election result. Key inputs include the evolution of the virus shock and the timeline for a vaccine — and their potential to bring forward market expectations of inflation and change equity market leadership to cyclicals.

       "  'content': ' The impact of Covid-19 has transformed the investment landscape in a matter of few months. It is precisely the type of event that underscores the importance of a portfolio construction approach that incorporates uncertainty in estimating asset returns instead of an over-reliance on point estimates. The material changes in our strategic asset views – a typically slow moving process – reflect an environment where capturing opportunities brought about by substantial swings in valuations and asset prices have warranted sizeable reallocations in a short amount of time. Sizeable reallocations The Covid-19 shock turned on its head the economic trajectory that markets had priced in at the end of last year, precipitating an urgent need to revisit strategic asset allocations. We argued as early as March at the depths of the market selloff that the impact of the pandemic and the policy response were likely to be severe enough to warrant an overhaul of how to position portfolios to be resilient to the accelerating structural changes. Market prices, asset valuations and economic projections have seen big swings in the space of two quarters. This has – in turn – had a sizeable impact on our expected returns and asset views over the course of the year. The charts below highlights how our asset views – based on our CMAs – have evolved from the start of the year to now. They highlight how typically slow-moving strategic asset allocation decisions need to be taken more quickly than usual to ready portfolios to be resilient to the new investment landscape and respond to potential price dislocations. Evolving viewsOur fixed income, equity and credit strategic views since the start of the year, August 2020 This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute. August 2020. Data as of June 2020. Notes: The charts show our asset views on a 10-year view from an unconstrained U.S. dollar perspective have changed through the course of the year. Our February 2020 views represent our asset preferences based on our capital market assumptions as of Dec 31, 2019. The March 2020 views show asset preferences based on CMAs as of March 26, 2020 and the May 2020 views represent preferences based on CMAs as of April 13, 2020. Global government bonds and EM equity allocations include respective China assets. The “overweight”, “neutral” and “underweight” refer to relative asset class tilts against a long-term equilibrium allocation as shown on our capital market assumptions website. The hypothetical portfolio may differ from those in other jurisdictions, is intended for information purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Index proxies are in the appendix. In February, we favored a barbell approach in our SAAs comprising equities and government bonds and preferring both to credit. We had flagged the risk of government bonds losing their appeal as portfolio ballast as yields approach their perceived lower bounds. Yet we were overweight the asset classes due to our conviction that U.S. Treasuries remained diversifiers thanks to their higher yields. Our focus on constructing downside-aware portfolios by incorporating uncertain in return assumptions – a core tenet of our process – informed the barbell approach. By March the story had changed dramatically. A quick and fierce selloff in risk assets, reminiscent of the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC), was underway on fears of the economic cost of the coronavirus outbreaks and containment measures. Yet we held a view that this would not be a repeat of GFC as long as the policy response was sizeable and swift because the economy and financial system were on firmer footing. We wrote in April 2020 that the unprecedented policy response would make the cumulative impact of the pandemic likely a fraction of that seen after the GFC even if the initial contraction was larger. Q2 GDP data have helped confirm this. We argued that strategic investors could turn the crisis into an opportunity by adding exposure to risk assets at the expense of government bonds where we reversed our overweight. We made a case for investors to lean back into equity exposures and significantly upgraded credit, with the sharp widening of spreads more than offsetting the risks of defaults and rating downgrades then. We introduced inflation-linked bonds to portfolios – a view that has become markedly more pronounced in our latest update. The size and scope of the policy response has driven the rebound in risk assets from the March lows – and it has also led to another revamp of our views. Our latest asset views – shown by the dots toward the right on each chart below – have moved to a substantial underweight in developed market government bonds and overweight in inflation-linked bonds. We are now mildly underweight global investment grade credit and equities after the sharp rebound in valuations, preferring high yield for income. We still see an important role for private markets and Chinese assets playing in strategic portfolios. Eyes on inflation We are in the midst of a policy revolution across many dimensions – central banks are bypassing the financial system to “go direct” to businesses and consumers, the lines between fiscal and monetary policy have been blurred, and there is greater government intervention in markets and in corporate governance. Such an unprecedented policy response was needed to stave off permanent economic scarring from the pandemic. Yet the impact of the policy revolution is likely to be much longer lasting than just a few quarters. One potential consequence of the policy revolution that could become an important driver of strategic and tactical asset allocation views is the likelihood of higher inflation in the medium term. A higher inflation regimeMarket implied rates of forward U.S. inflation vs. BlackRock inflation estimate, August 2020 Forward-looking estimates may not come to pass.Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute and the Federal Reserve with data from Refinitiv Datastream. August 2020. Notes: The chart shows market pricing of expected average inflation over the five-year period starting in 2025. We show using the five-year/five-year inflation swap that shows market expectations of average five-year forward inflation five years from now. The orange dot shows our current estimate of average U.S. CPI for the same five-year period i.e. 2025-2030. The near-term focus on the disinflationary forces of the demand shock in the aftermath of Covid-19 misses the bigger picture in our view. The impetus for higher inflation in coming years is likely to come from fiscally expansionary policies rather than monetary policy unlike over the past decade. At the same time, both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are conducting strategy reviews that are poised to shift their reaction functions to tolerate higher inflation and make up for past misses. Add to this forces such as deglobalization that amount to a negative supply shock and inflation expectations could start to ratchet higher. The build-up of debt to pay for fiscal packages means it will likely be politically more palatable for economies to inflate their way out of debt rather than reintroduce austerity measures. All of the above suggests to us that we are poised for a shift to a regime of higher – and more uncertain – inflation from one marked by low and stable inflation. Our expectation for U.S. average inflation in the medium term is significantly higher than current market pricing. See the chart below. We believe increased fiscal and monetary policy coordination – without a clear exit strategy and proper guardrails – raises the risk of uncontrolled deficit spending and monetary expansion, potentially leading to higher inflation as we outlined in Policy revolution. This is not our base case but bears monitoring in coming years. The policy revolution’s most direct impact on our asset views? Reinforcing our underweight on developed market (DM) government bonds. Their role as portfolio ballast against equity selloffs is challenged at yields near perceived lower bounds, as we argued last year in Bonds and ballast: testing the limits. Now, interest rates have been pressed further to the floor. Yield curve control – already rolled out in some countries and being openly debated in others – could effectively keep government bond yields stuck near lower bounds, reducing volatility and the range of return outcomes. Our portfolio construction process now accounts for the existence of effective lower bounds on yields. The diversification appeal of nominal government bonds in portfolios dwindles when yields are close to their assumed lower bounds. What assets could play the role of portfolio ballast instead? There is no one-for-one alternative – no other asset class offers the same liquidity and depth. We still see a role for government bonds but prefer a more targeted approach. We believe a mix of other assets will need to be used in conjunction, underscoring the importance of taking a cross-asset, whole portfolio view to resilience. Gold has caught investors’ attention as a potential inflationary hedge. The precious metals rally is perhaps indicative of the investors seeing inflationary pressures build and seeking out alternative risk-off hedges. Yet we see gold as more driven by sentiment and hence more akin to a tactical call. We prefer other assets to build longer-term resilience such as inflation-linked bonds that could offer the added benefit of being negatively correlated with equities in an environment where nominal yields are capped. Private markets could also play a role as the asset class affords investors the ability to shape more bespoke exposures not typically found in public markets. Challenging corporate fundamentals A significantly changed economic and policy landscape filters through to corporate fundamentals in a myriad of ways. Our CMAs across asset classes have changed significantly since the update at the end of 2019 that reflected a very different outlook than the one facing investors today. Valuations – the primary driver of long-run returns, in our view – have seen extraordinary moves in just two quarters. Such swings inevitably lead to sizeable shifts in expected returns – and asset preferences – even for strategic horizons. We break down the contributors to equity and credit returns for our latest update and contrast them with the prior two quarters in the chart below. Breaking down our expected returns This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance.. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, data as of 30 June 2020. Notes: Chart shows the contributors of our 5-year forward expected returns for US high yield and US equities as reported at 31 Dec 2019 (Q4 2019) at 14 April 2020 (Q1 2020) and at 30 June 2020 (Q2 2020). For high yield, the total expected return is broken down into expected loss due to default and downgrades and expected returns due to carry, valuation and rolldown or reinvestments of coupon income. For equities, the total return is broken down into repricing due to changes in interest rates, changes in the equity risk premium and the impact of changing macroeconomic assumptions such as growth and inflation (fundamentals), earnings growth expectations and dividend yields. Indexes used: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield Index and MSCI USA. Indexes are unmanaged and not subject to fees. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. There can be no guarantee that any forecasts made will come to pass. Equity and credit markets have scrambled to digest the post Covid-19 landscape without a clear historical playbook or much company guidance. We have meaningfully downgraded the outlook for corporate fundamentals. See the right panel below. We slashed our earnings estimates beyond the near-term consensus view, particularly in more cyclical markets to mirror our economic outlook. Yet equity market pricing also depends on the longer-term impact on earnings relative to prior expectations. We see a sharp earnings shock in 2020 and a gradual recovery over several years to pre Covid-19 levels. But the deepest blow is likely behind us, in our view. The recovery in earnings now depends on the restart of economic activity globally and successful implementation of policy stimulus. The “even lower for even longer” outlook for interest rates is broadly supportive of equity valuations, in our view. An important element of the portfolio revolution we discussed earlier has been greater government intervention in the private sector. For example, some companies that have accepted state funding during the pandemic are restricted in paying dividends and share repurchases. This year’s cuts in dividends payouts have reduced equity income at a time when income from bonds is anaemic at best. The key will be how persistent such cuts are and when payouts can resume. Dividend payouts have historically recovered quickly, but this is not a normal downturn and the government intervention we are seeing raises the risk of a slower recovery in dividends payouts. Defaults and rating downgrades are likely to rise in the more challenging economic landscape – a key reason for higher assumed losses across our expected returns for credit. See the left panel below. The significant widening in credit spreads offset the increase in expected losses at the end of the first quarter, spurring our upbeat view on credit and an overall overweight on the asset class. The starting point for credit – particularly investment grade – is trickier at the end of Q2 given the swift repricing in the past few months. Spreads have tightened significantly since March, buoyed by unprecedented central bank bond purchases that have buoyed risk sentiment. We have cut our overweight stance on investment grade credit – and on credit overall. We still like high yield credit for its income potential in a low-return world, keeping us overall neutral on the broader asset class. Revamping the whole portfolio We have long emphasized that the strategic asset allocation decision is the most important driver of whole portfolio returns. This is even more pertinent with Covid-19 fundamentally reshaping the investment landscape. Anchoring investment views to the past is becoming less relevant as structural trends such as rising inequality, deglobalization, the policy revolution and sustainability race toward us. Our CMAs – the linchpin of our strategic asset class preferences – capture the effects of these structural shifts on future asset returns. Our strategic asset views represent the real portfolio implications of our CMAs and our latest research. The chart below shows our current unconstrained U.S. SAA on a 10-year horizon with and without private markets. We contrast this against a representative multi-asset portfolio with a similar risk profile. This portfolio – based on a BlackRock industry survey – is intended only as an approximate guide of average industry practice and is not an actual portfolio.

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, August 2020. Data as of 30 June 2020. Notes: The bar charts on the left show our hypothetical, unconstrained, US dollar-denominated equity-bond SAA built using our portfolio construction approach and CMAs for August 2020. The middle bar assumes private markets are excluded from the investable universe. The U.S. representative multi-asset portfolio shows the average of a client survey conducted by the BlackRock U.S. Wealth Advisory group. The survey comprises 3,319 advisor models with a similar risk target of 8% and similar objectives as our unconstrained SAA. The allocation is illustrative only, and intended to be an approximate guide of average industry practice. It does not represent any actual portfolio. Global government bonds and EM equity allocations include respective China assets. Income private markets include infrastructure debt, direct lending, real estate mezzanine debt and US core real estate. Growth private markets include global private equity buyouts and infrastructure equity. The hypothetical portfolio may differ from those in other jurisdictions, is intended for information purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Index proxies are in the appendix. Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. A few distinguishing features of our SAA: Private markets: They are a source of attractive returns and a source of resilience during times of public market volatility, in our view. One lesson from the GFC was that flexible portfolio construction allows private market investors to capitalize on market dislocations. We have shown in the past how institutional investors may have room for relatively large allocations, depending on risk tolerance. Private markets may not be suitable for all investor types, particularly those with high liquidity needs such as mature defined benefit pensions. They are also a highly complex asset class that typically entail higher governance costs because of due diligence and assembling a large team of specialists. Certain private market assets also have a relatively short history making performance during downturns harder to assess. The ultimate sizing of private markets is highly dependent on investor-specific objectives. Geographical diversification: One pillar of our investment outlook is that global growth will increasingly be led by two poles – one that is U.S.-centric and one China-centric. We believe deliberate geographic equity exposures - balanced across regions tied to the U.S. and China - are vital for real portfolio resilience in a deglobalizing world. We believe China is under-represented in global indexes – and a benchmark-weighted strategic allocation to China based on current index weights would amount to an effective underweight. We believe those allocations should be significantly higher: we are overweight Chinese government bonds and prefer Chinese equities to DM peers. Sustainability: The pandemic has also underscored our belief that sustainability is an important return driver and that ‘green’ companies should be resilient in adverse markets while also having upside return potential. We think sustainability isn’t yet fully appreciated or priced in markets. Rather, it will drive investment flows and repricing in decades to come. We plan to publish work on incorporating sustainability directly into our CMAs in coming months. Our bottom-line: We hold more private markets, both growth and income. One reason for our lower allocations to public equity and credit relative to the representative portfolios is that we prefer opportunities in private markets where our allocations are materially higher. If private markets were excluded from the investable universe that allocation would largely go back into DM equities as see in the middle bar below. We prefer a smaller allocation to nominal DM government bonds and investment grade credit, but a larger allocation to inflation-linked bonds. Finally, our equity exposure is tilted more toward emerging markets. See our interactive CMA website for full details. Download report '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'What would the world look like with less water? We explore the often overlooked risk of water stress and its financial implications on portfolios. Take a look.',\n",
       "  'content': ' An understated risk The global pandemic has reinforced the importance of resilience in investment portfolios. This includes sustainability-related risks that investors may have been underappreciating, ranging from vulnerable global supply chains to health and safety issues. We believe increased asset flows into sustainable investing strategies in 2020 are part of a tectonic shift that could last decades. Physical risks posed by climate events – ranging from hurricanes to wildfires – have captured growing attention in the investment community. We zeroed in on these risks in Getting physical of April 2019, painting a granular picture of the financial implications across municipal bonds, commercial real estate and U.S. utility equities. In this piece, we extend our work on physical risks to water stress. What do we mean by water risk? One in four people globally live in regions at high risk of scarcity – with water demand exceeding supply – according to the World Resources Institute (WRI). This creates financial risks that investors today may not be pricing in. Examples include rising spending needs (to raise efficiency and meet tough regulations) and the cost of production disruptions (unavailability of water for agriculture or cooling power plants). Regulators are zeroing on such risks: A recent European Central Bank report included water stress among the physical climate risks it may require financial institutions to manage and disclose. Water: A scarce resource In past decades, the global demand for water has been increasing at a pace of 1% annually, according to the United Nations’ 2018 World Water Development Report, as growing urban populations strain resources. At the same time, climate change shifts the distribution of water supply by disrupting precipitation patterns. Higher water stress levels indicate greater competition among users. This increases the costs of sourcing, and forces conservation measures. Other factors behind this stress include lax environmental rules and pollution, which can reduce water quality and limit its potential use. Competition for waterEstimated water stress around the world by risk zone, 2030 Source: BlackRock Investment Institute and BlackRock Sustainable Investing, with data from WRI. Notes: WRI defines water stress as the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies. Higher water stress levels indicate more competition among water users. Water withdrawals include those from irrigation, livestock, industrial use, and domestic sectors. Available supplies capture natural runoff as well as the impact of upstream water use and dam operations on downstream water availability. Water stress is assessed on WRI’s five point scale, ranging from “low” to “extremely high” (1 to 5). The geographic variation in climate patterns and human demand for water, together with changes caused by rising global temperatures, result in great variation in the distribution of water stress around the world. The graphic above uses WRI projections that rank geographies’ water stress from “low” to “extremely high” as of 2030. India, the Middle East, northern and southern Africa, Australia, and the U.S. Southwest stand out as likely high risk zones within a decade of today. Key findings Water stress has financial implications. Companies with production facilities in stressed regions may face greater operating costs and insurance premiums. They will likely need to spend more on efficiency measures, recycling and conservation – to meet stringent regulations that could tighten even further. In the real estate market, tenant preferences are likely to shift toward green buildings. We use global real estate investment trusts (REITs) to illustrate how exposure to water stress can vary by location and over time. Our approach combines the geolocation of about 84,000 global REIT properties and mapping them to the 590 publicly listed REITs that own them. We then used the WRI’s “Aqueduct” model to assess REITs exposure to various water stress risks today and in the future. This provides deeper insights on water-related issues faced by companies than traditional assessments, in our view. The risks are not unique to real estate – and we see our approach as applicable across asset classes. Stress in SouthwestEstimated water stress in the U.S. by risk zone Source: BlackRock Investment Institute and BlackRock Sustainable Investing, with data from WRI and SNL, May 2020. The chart shows estimated water stress levels across the U.S. Southwest as of 2014 (actual) and 2030 (projected), using WRI data. Grey dots indicate properties held by listed global REITs, as identified by BlackRock using SNL’s database. Water stress is assessed on WRI’s five point scale, ranging from “low” to “extremely high” (1 to 5). We use the U.S. Southwest to illustrate our methodology. We use 2014 (actual) as our baseline because WRI’s data draw on an extensive modeling and simulation project ran by Utrecht University that spanned 1960-2014. This data represents the most recent and accurate global picture of water stress available, we believe. Key assumptions: Almost the entire U.S. Southwest, including states such as California, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, faces extreme water stress issues by 2030. Most of the current REIT properties in the region, indicated by the grey dots, lie in these high risk zones. Roughly 60% of the global REIT properties we were able to geolocate will experience high water stress by 2030, we find, driven by increased urbanization and the effects of climate change. This is more than double the number today. Water-related issues are not yet a material cash-flow driver for REITs, in our view, and the risks can be mitigated. Yet they may become more material over time due to knock-on effects such as regulatory shifts. Almost all REIT properties in Malaysia, Philippines, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia will likely be in high risk water zones by 2030, our analysis shows. Roughly two-thirds of today’s U.S. REIT properties will be at high risk of water stress by 2030, double the proportion today, we also conclude. Investors and tenants are increasingly focused on water stress, as well as other environmental factors such as energy efficiency, green certifications and carbon footprints. REITs that score highly on these metrics can potentially save costs, while screening as more “green.” This may make their equities more attractive to potential investors and their buildings more desirable for occupants. Water stress has wide-ranging implications across asset classes. We show how the agriculture, electric power and food and beverage industries may be most at risk. The creditworthiness of some countries, states and municipalities facing shortages could also come under threat as they face additional costs to fortify their water infrastructure. This comes on top of other growing physical climate risks such as exposure to flooding and other extreme weather events. Companies resilient to water stress and other climate-related risks may fetch a premium in the transition to a more sustainable world, we believe. Better understanding and quantifying the risks can help investors mitigate exposures and potentially exploit any mispricing. Related data and insights are valuable tools for investors to engage with companies and issuers on their sustainability-related efforts. Widening the lens How might the analysis be extended beyond REITs? Our geolocation-based approach can also be applied to unlisted real estate – and a host of other asset classes and sectors, we believe. The materiality of stress varies greatly across industries, as the Who’s at risk? graphic below shows. Relatively high water users such as the agricultural, electric power, and food and beverage sectors are among the biggest hot spots, this analysis from the WRI suggests. Who’s at risk? Water stress materiality matrix across major equity market sectors, 2020 Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from WRI, 2019. Note: The chart shows the materiality across industries of various physical risks related to the quantity of water supply (too little or too much). The scale ranges from not relevant (white), to low (lightest tone) and very high (darkest tone). WRI’s weights are based on information provided in corporate water disclosure reports and input from industry experts. For details on the methodology see Hofste, R., S. Kuzma, S. Walker, E.H. Sutanudjaja, et.al. 2019. “Aqueduct3.0: Updated Decision-Relevant Global Water Risk Indicators.” Available online at: https://files.wri.org/s3fs-public/aqueduct-30-updated-decision-relevant-global-water-risk-indicators_1.pdf All sectors represent WRI’s assessment, except for REITs, which is based on BlackRock’s analysis replicating the WRI methodology. For illustrative purposes only. The matrix assesses the materiality of various facets of water risk – ranging from baseline stress to coastal flooding and droughts – across industries. The focus here in on risks related to water quantity – either too much or too little. It does not address the full spectrum of water-related risks. Other components include risks related to declining quality (water that is unfit for use); as well as reputational and regulatory risks (such as conflicts with the public over poor management of wastewater). This illustrates the complexity of assessing risks across sectors – and the need to go beyond headline data. Yet we see it as a valuable starting point for assessing materiality of water stress across sectors. The impacts could be dire in the agricultural sector, with a direct link between water availability for irrigation and crop yields. Irrigated agriculture is, on average, at least twice as productive per unit of land as rainfed agriculture, according to the World Bank. Lack of water availability for cooling thermal power plants poses a serious risk to electric utilities. Some 27% of U.S. electric production would be severely impacted by steady increases in water stress by 2030, according to a 2017 study in Nature. Cities and municipalities in water stressed regions may also face investment costs on wastewater recycling and fortifying their infrastructure. This has implications for the debt of governments and municipalities. Moody’s, for example, said in a report in early 2020 that climate-related risks posed long-term risks to the creditworthiness of the greater-Sydney region in Australia. It identified water stress as the single greatest challenge. Challenges we plan to tackle include applying our analysis on water stress to companies with global supply chains. This would require a dataset identifying the location of all operating facilities of a firm so that the full exposure of companies – and their securities – can be determined. Our understanding of the connection between climate risk and financial risk is evolving – and further research is needed to quantify effects with greater confidence. To be sure, rising water stress is not a one-way street. It can possibly be mitigated through breakthroughs such as better irrigation and wastewater treatment, and advances in efficiency and desalination. Yet we have high conviction that water stress is a key component of climate risks that are set to grow increasingly financially material over time. This suggests the time to integrate them into investment processes is now. The financial implications Industrial and commercial activity accounts for the bulk of freshwater use around the world. The agricultural, textile, energy, industrials, chemicals, pharmaceutical and mining industries account for around 70% of usage, according to CDP’s 2018 Global water report. Residential and office use are part of the remaining 30%. The financial implications of reduced water availability are varied. Companies in water-stressed locations can face costs from disrupted production, higher capital expenditures, compliance and enforcement penalties. They may need to spend more to mitigate the effects of water stress, such as investments in efficiency, pollution abatement, re-use, recycling and conservation measures. The takeaway for investors: Companies that manage water resources better than their peers may offer more resilient earnings streams. The risks cut across sectors. Lack of water for irrigation and animal consumption threatens the food industry. Insufficient cooling water can cause brownouts in electric power plants, hurting electric utilities and their customers. Even the leisure industry may be affected: shortages in India in 2019 forced hotel closures. Water stress is expected to intensify in the decades ahead, in line with many of the other physical risks posed by climate change that we outlined in Getting physical of April 2019. One in two people will live in water-stressed locations by 2030, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) expects. Global water infrastructure costs are expected to rise fourfold to $150 billion annually from 2017 levels by 2030, the World Bank estimates. Who’s vulnerable?Water stress exposure by REIT market, 2014 vs. 2030 Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from SNL and WRI, June 2020. Notes: The chart shows the percentage of REIT properties in the top-20 global REIT markets that lie in regions with high water stress (zones 4 and 5 according to WRI’s framework), both as of 2014 (baseline) and 2030. Projections are based on WRI data. We used the SNL database to geolocate around 85,000 global REIT properties owned by listed companies. For illustrative purposes only. Forward-looking estimates may not come to pass. The chart above illustrates how this may play out in the global REITs Industry. Less than 30% of REIT properties today lie in regions with high water stress, according to WRI data. That proportion could more than double by 2030, assuming the footprint of REIT properties remains unchanged. Download full report '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The U.S. announced a historic policy stimulus package to help stymie the economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",
       "  'content': ' U.S. policymakers have announced a fiscal package of more than $2 trillion, as well as extraordinary Federal Reserve measures to cushion the economic and market impact of the coronavirus shock. The combined actions are unprecedented in their size – and in the degree of coordination between monetary and fiscal authorities. They represent the type of decisive policy response we have been calling for – and set the scene for an eventual economic recovery. The rapid shutdown of the world’s largest economy in an effort to contain the coronavirus spread was threatening to set in motion a vicious circle: disrupted cash flows lead to rising defaults, making it harder for banks to extend credit. This credit crunch, in turn, could accelerate bankruptcies. The U.S. fiscal stimulus – larger than that delivered in the global financial crisis – includes direct cash payments to households, backstops for small-and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), a historic expansion of unemployment benefits, and large-scale support for corporate credit and market functioning alongside the Fed. Implementation of both health and fiscal measures will be key to ensure they have the desired effect. The Fed’s “whatever-it-takes” actions include a commitment to massively expand its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, lending programs to directly support SMEs, states and municipalities, and buying U.S. corporate bonds for the first time. The U.S response follows coordinated fiscal and monetary action in Australia, Canada and the UK, and a patchwork of fiscal stimulus supported by monetary policy in the euro area. Governments disburse funds to provide a financial bridge to households and businesses. Central banks will be called upon so that interest rates don’t rise in an uncontrolled way amid the largest peacetime relief program ever seen. This makes the type of policy coordination we called for last year essential. It entails large-scale asset purchases, including the Fed announcing open-ended buying of U.S. Treasuries and mortgages. Keeping long-term rates in check is critical. Explicit yield curve control is one way to do this, as the Bank of Japan has shown. Once we better understand the scale and impact of the outbreak, the policy response is paving the road for an eventual – and strong – economic and market rebound. Market moves in recent weeks have been reminiscent of the financial crisis – and have likely thrown many portfolios below their benchmark weights in risk assets. For long-term investors, significant value has been created. We favor rebalancing toward broad asset class benchmark weights to regain an overall neutral stance. Within equities, we prefer the U.S. on the strength of the policy response and the market’s quality characteristics. Download now '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We could return with limited permanent economic damage if authorities deliver a policy response to support through the shock.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Global markets have taken fright at the scale of potential economic damage wrought by the coronavirus containment measures. We see the economy coming to a near standstill – but expect activity to ultimately return with limited permanent economic damage as long as authorities deliver an overwhelming fiscal and monetary policy response to bridge businesses and households through the shock. That is starting to happen. The pledged policy response has been swift – and we expect total fiscal stimulus to be similar in size to that of the financial crisis but in a shorter timeframe. We believe market volatility is distracting from the sheer amount of promised stimulus – with more to come. The numbers are changing day by day, reflecting real-time updates of the potential depth of the economic hit. U.S. officials went from talk of minimal stimulus to more than $1 trillion –or about 5% of GDP. The plan calls for measures we had advocated: going direct, or relieving the cash flow pressures facing households and businesses especially smaller firms –with money handouts. The European Union has pledged 1% of GDP, with individual countries signaling larger amounts and financial guarantees ranging from 10% of GDP to unlimited liquidity support. Fiscal policy is the frontline of policy action and should focus on boosting public health measures and alleviating potential cash flow crunches through liquidity bridges. The UK, Canada and Australia have served as models for coordination between fiscal and monetary policy. For central banks, the critical focus is alleviating the dysfunction of market pricing and tightening of financial conditions. The Federal Reserve has unleashed an array of liquidity and new facilities to unclog the pipes of the financial system. The European Central Bank put together a bolder response after its communication mishap last week, launching a €750 billion bond buying programme. European officials may also activate the European Stability Mechanism on relaxed terms to free up even more bond-buying capacity. Markets, in our view, will ultimately settle down if three conditions are met: 1) visibility on the ultimate scale of the coronavirus outbreak and evidence the infection rate has peaked over the long term; 2) deployment of credible and coordinated policy packages; and 3) confidence that financial markets are functioning properly. Once we better understand the scale and impact of the outbreak, the policy response is setting the stage for an eventual – and strong – recovery. This is why we stay neutral on risk assets and believe investors should take a long-term perspective. We emphasize portfolio resilience through a benchmark allocation to government bonds, quality equities, cash and sustainable investing. For long-term investors, significant value has been created in risk assets. Download now '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Market moves have been reminiscent of the financial crisis, but the economy and financial system are on stronger footing.',\n",
       "  'content': ' The virus shock’s impact will be likely be large and sharp, but we believe investors should be level headed , take a long term perspective and stay invested. The scale of financial market moves in response to the coronavirus outbreak has been reminiscent of the global financial crisis. We do not think this is 2008, however. The virus shock’s impact will be likely be large and sharp, but we believe investors should be level-headed, take a long-term perspective and stay invested. The economic and financial backdrop today is much stronger today than going into the crisis of 2008. We don’t see this as an expansion-ending event - provided that a pre-emptive and coordinated policy response is delivered. And we see encouraging signs that this policy response is starting to come together. It will need to be a joint and decisive effort between fiscal and monetary policy, as detailed in Time for policy to go direct. The key vulnerabilities that need to be addressed: cash challenges faced by companies, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, and households. The BlackRock Investment Institute changed its moderately pro-risk stance to neutral two weeks ago as the coronavirus outbreak began spreading across the globe. Authorities have strong incentives to take aggressive public health measures to prevent the virus from spreading due to capacity constraints in the health care sector. This will likely result in a sharp and deep economic slowdown in the near term. Market moves have been compounded by oil prices plunging more than 20% – on track for the biggest daily drop since in the early 1990s – as an OPEC pact to stabilize prices unraveled. This should ultimately benefit growth, but it also risks at least temporary financial and economic dislocations in energy-heavy sectors, such as emerging market commodity exporters and parts of U.S. high yield. This is a time for investors to keep a long-term perspective. The ultimate depth and duration of the coronavirus’ economic impact are highly uncertain, but we still believe the shock should be temporary as the outbreak will eventually dissipate and economic activity will normalize – assuming the needed policy response is delivered. We stay at benchmark weights for equities, and overweight the more defensive quality and minimum volatility style factors. We favor portfolio resilience, including cash and sustainable investing strategies, and still prefer U.S. Treasuries over lower-yielding peers for portfolio ballast. We recognize Treasury allocations are playing their role during moments of high uncertainty, but see risks of a diminishing buffer against equity market sell-offs and a snap-back in yields from historically low levels.

       "  'abstract': 'A coordinated policy response to the coronavirus shock is needed to avoid persistent economic damage.',\n",
       "  'content': ' We outline the need for a decisive, pre-emptive and coordinated policy response to the coronavirus shock. The future evolution and global spread of the coronavirus outbreak is highly uncertain. What we know is that containment and social distancing are ultimately achieved by reducing economic activity. Faced with resource constraints in healthcare systems, there are strong incentives to take aggressive containment measures to slow the spreading. The impact on economic activity will likely be sharp – and could be deep. The depth and duration of the economic impact is uncertain but should be temporary as the outbreak itself will eventually dissipate. That requires a decisive, pre-emptive and coordinated policy response to avoid the disruptions to income streams and financial flows that could cause persistent economic damage – and end the cycle. We wrote in August 2019 about the nearly exhausted monetary policy toolbox and the challenges it poses for dealing with the next downturn. This has now come to the fore – and that’s why it is time to go direct with policy support. Simply using up the limited monetary policy space remaining – interest rates, forward guidance or even quantitative easing – could quickly put the macro focus on the lack of tools left and thus backfire. The only way to address this is to add further lines of defense and make fiscal policy an explicit part of the crisis response toolkit. The first step is to provide frontline public health agencies with necessary financial resources. But a joint effort between monetary and fiscal policy is required to avoid a raft of financial failures at the grassroot level due to demand shortfalls, production disruptions or payment delays that can all lead to cash flow squeezes. Small- and medium-sized enterprises, for example, risk having cash flows cut off if they have to rely solely on support through financial markets. That is why any solutions will need to involve “going direct” with policy – that is, more directly relieving the cash flow pressures facing some sectors of the economy. Authorities in all major economies have to fast-track sizeable, comprehensive and flexible support programs to pre-emptively provide direct financial support to companies and households facing a short-term loss of income. That would prevent these temporary disruptions from turning into a full-blown global recession. Deploying these programs will involve coordination of monetary and fiscal policy. Recognizing that these measures will be temporary justifies an aggressive policy response. The experience of the global financial crisis and aftermath shows that the policy effectiveness would be greatly enhanced if the international community approached these measures as a deliberate package delivered in a coordinated fashion. A comprehensive global response should have the following elements: First, to support households, fiscal measures could also include generous sick-pay support and short-time work schemes to stabilize incomes and to limit job losses – especially where such arrangements were not available before. Several countries are already preparing such measures. Income support can come via adjustments to welfare and labor market programs, such as unemployment insurance. Welfare programs could also be tweaked by temporarily enhancing benefits and reducing waiting times until citizens become eligible. Direct payments to affected households are also an option. Second, to support companies, fiscal authorities could suspend collection of tax revenues and social security contributions to provide temporary cash flow relief to firms and the self-employed while at the same time accelerating outgoing public payments and reducing unpaid bills to the private sector. In some instances, cash grants via local governments and natural disaster relief agencies might be required beyond loans. These are ways to directly provide some relief to company balance sheets that can be quickly implemented within current government programs. Automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to work fully and, if needed, existing fiscal rules could be temporarily suspended. Third, monetary authorities should also be ready to deploy more direct and targeted liquidity support, including expanding funding-for-lending facilities – providing liquidity to commercial banks that is earmarked specifically for lending to corporates hurt by the virus outbreak. Government guarantees can help cover any bank lending at preferential rates to meet the corporate sector’s need for additional working capital. Alternatively, state-owned development banks could be used as a conduit for such lending. In countries with weaker public finances, asset purchase programs could safeguard the government’s funding conditions. A decisive and pre-emptive policy response is essential given the uncertainty around what will likely be material near-term disruptions due to the coronavirus outbreak. For the most part these measures will be fiscal in nature – and some will require coordination between fiscal and monetary authorities. Monetary policy should focus on preventing an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions and ensure the functioning of financial markets. Central banks going it alone with interest rate cuts risk wasting precious policy ammunition. We believe decisive policy action now would help avoid opening the door to more radical ideas and uncontrolled fiscal spending.

       "  'content': ' A commonly held view is that a return sacrifice is needed when adopting sustainable investing. We disagree – and in fact believe the opposite is true. We believe there is a fundamental point that is often overlooked with sustainable investing. There will likely be long transition unfolding over years and decades, driven by investment flows, that will reshape all asset prices. Because these flows are in their early stages, we believe that the full consequences of a shift to sustainable investing are not yet in market prices – and a return advantage can be gained during this transition. Just getting started The past year has seen a marked shift in society’s attitudes toward sustainability. This shift is spurring political pressure, a regulatory push and technological advancements to create the foundations of a more sustainable world, leading to a change in investor behavior and setting in motion a major yet gradual capital reallocation. Society’s long transition toward the practice of sustainable investing is likely to drive market adjustments for years and even decades. This tectonic shift has significant implications for the expected returns and relative pricing of assets not just those perceived to be sustainable but for every asset in the investment universe. The consequences could not just alter existing return drivers or risk premia but create entirely new sources of premia. One commonly held view argues that sustainable investing is not going to offer much return opportunity to investors from a basic financial theory perspective. This view holds that today’s prices should fully reflect the predictable component of future flows into sustainable assets that is, the adoption of sustainable investing is already at a “steady state” reflected in current prices. We believe the commonly held view is not just wrong but that the opposite will occur. The coming capital reallocation is not yet in prices: this long transition in sustainable preferences and practices will make some assets more expensive (those with high sustainability) and others cheaper (those with low sustainability). This means that assets with high sustainability will be rewarded through the long transition period, the opposite of what others posit. All about the flows There are three channels through which sustainability will change investment: profitability, risk and investor flows. The industry is typically focused on the first two: research has helped quantify the impact of sustainability on profitability and risk in different industries. Yet we believe the third channel is underappreciated – and far more important: the impact of major flows driven by the widespread adoption of sustainable investing during the long transition period. Our argument that flows will drive a “sustainability wave” is about much more than just the idea that today’s youth and their preferences affect market pricing. Though this contributes to the story as we discuss below the sustainability wave and its market impact is about a broader shift in preferences spanning all generations and societies. The sustainability wave is not purely about demographics. But it provides a parallel. Just as the baby boom generation’s impact on the economy and financial markets played out through taste preferences and wealth flows, the sustainability wave will play out over decades, remaking economies and industries as capital is reallocated. One contributing factor to the wave is, however, demographically induced: an ongoing transfer of wealth to a younger generation with greater awareness of sustainability. Millennials and Gen Xers are expected to gain a major share of assets. Some might argue that the younger generation’s preference for sustainability may dampen if not reverse as they age. Yet academic literature underscores that the personal experiences of economic fluctuations play an important role in persistently shaping individual preferences, especially at a younger age. As our paper Getting physical highlights, the number of natural disasters causing U.S. $1 billion plus in damages has been on a steady rise. Major negative shocks related to sustainability from hurricanes and wildfires in the U.S. and Australia, heat waves in Europe and flooding around the world may result in a durable shift in the younger generation’s taste towards more sustainable assets. A systematic approach While the transition period toward a new steady state could last decades, the resulting returns we expect during the transition should impact the strategic asset allocations built today. To meet these challenges, a portfolio construction framework needs to allow for: The impact of climate change and other sustainability effects on fundamental macro variables A clear link between the impact of these altered macro variables and the risk and return for all assets A means of allowing for the time-varying nature of the return and risk impact The creation of new sustainability premia that involves identifying factors that exhibit the sustainability premia and discounts within and across various asset classes A systematic means of building portfolios to reflect the inherent uncertainty applied to all future estimates Deriving a set of factors and rewards to sustainability – from which to create these new CMAs – is not trivial. Our flows-based concept is intuitive and drives the sustainability premia. The challenge is quantifying the impact. Our argument is built on the idea that what’s priced now doesn’t reflect what will be priced in the future. We instead identify exposures that capture sustainability using BlackRock’s proprietary sustainability metrics across asset classes. In our framework, whether these metrics have historically explained returns is secondary to whether they capture sustainability. To these identified exposures, we would ascribe a reward or discount by combining estimates of steady-state premia and the time-varying return impacts of the transition period until that steady state is reached. While quantification of this is difficult, there are different parallels from history that are informative. The pace at which markets price in slow-moving effects has precedent.

       "  'abstract': 'We are reducing our overweight equity and credit exposures due to coronavirus outbreaks but maintain benchmark holdings.',\n",
       "  'content': ' We still see the U.S. and global expansion as intact. But the risk is that a broadening of the outbreak undermines fundamentals and triggers a premature end to the economic cycle. Global markets have been roiled by fears over the impact of the coronavirus outbreaks, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hitting record lows and the S&P 500 Index on track for its largest weekly decline since the global financial crisis. We are reducing our global equity and credit exposure to neutral from modestly overweight on a 12-month horizon. The speed and scale of the equity slide shows that markets have already reflected much potential economic impact. That is why we maintain benchmark exposures but think it’s too soon to add risk. The spread of coronavirus outbreaks beyond China has opened up a new global dimension to the epidemic – and potential for a sharper contraction from efforts to contain it. Yet we expect the expansion to remain intact. We see a sharp rebound once potential disruptions to economic activity dissipate, even if there are now material downside risks to the growth trajectory and risk assets may overshoot to the downside due to the heightened uncertainty. This may push some developed economies toward the brink of a technical recession, notably Japan and the euro area – both regions that were already on the cusp. Our base case: This is a temporary shock, albeit one of unknown depth and duration. But the risk is that the disruptions create liquidity crunches that, if not addressed, could trigger a premature end to the economic cycle. A sustained tightening of financial conditions or impairment to market liquidity could be met by coordinated policy easing by major central banks even though many, such as in the euro area and Japan, have limited policy space. Fiscal policy will likely also be an important part of the toolkit, especially in China, with governments ramping up public health spending and providing relief to the hardest hit industries and regions. We see material risks to global supply chains, concentrated in tech, autos and capital goods. Global trade tensions were already leading companies to reassess supply chains. Over time, these supply shocks risk a shift to a macro regime of slow growth and higher inflation as some of the benefits of globalization unwind. We shift our moderate pro-risk stance to a neutral position. An additional source of financial market uncertainty is the historically wide divergence between the policy agendas of the parties in the U.S. presidential election. We advocate portfolio resilience through the quality and min vol equity factors, the ballast properties of government bonds – especially U.S. Treasuries – and cash. Download now '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Inflation jitters We have been flagging higher inflation since the unprecedented policy response to the pandemic, and this prospect is now driving markets. Our core new nominal theme implies that rising inflation will have more benign market implications than in the past. Central banks are likely to lean against any sharp rises in nominal government bond yields. As a result, real interest rates could stay negative into the medium term. This makes for a positive backdrop for risk assets, and keeps us pro risk with tactical overweights in equities and credit. Yet markets have risen significantly, and we see potential for pullbacks driven by pandemic and vaccine rollout dynamics. Globalization rewired The pandemic has accelerated a rewiring of globalization – with a bipolar U.S.-China world order at its center. We see the new U.S. administration bringing greater predictability in trade policies. Climate is likely to become a central policy priority – and an area for potential U.S.-China cooperation. Yet economic, technological and strategic competition with China looks here to stay – and we believe investors need exposures to both poles of global growth. Rising debt A spike in government debt to record levels – a result of a policy revolution in cooperation between fiscal and monetary authorities – was a necessary response to the Covid shock. It may be politically tough for governments to unwind large-scale fiscal support, and the perceived safety premium for holding government bonds could eventually erode. But we are not concerned about these dynamics in the near term as central banks face pressures to maintain a stable, low-rate environment, keeping a lid on debt servicing costs. Unprecedented response The joint fiscal-monetary policy revolution has delivered historic support to help bridge economies to a post-pandemic world when vaccines become more widely available. We have seen an unprecedented rise in peacetime spending, with discretionary fiscal stimulus far exceeding what we saw after the global financial crisis (GFC). The increase in debt under the current shock also exceeds that of the GFC, even in the absence of large-scale bailouts this time. This has happened against a backdrop of much higher debt levels than a decade ago. As a result, debt-to-GDP ratios have soared to record levels globally. Key risks ahead Fiscal and financial dominance are key risks that could be mutually reinforcing. It could become politically difficult for governments to unwind large-scale fiscal support. And raising interest rates will become more politically fraught for central banks against a backdrop of high debt levels. Even a courageous central bank may end up having to backtrack if an attempt to normalize policy were to result in a “taper tantrum” event that significantly tightened financial conditions. A bipolar world order The pandemic has accelerated a rewiring of globalization – with a bipolar U.S.-China world order at its center. We see the Biden administration as bringing greater predictability and taking a different approach on trade and climate policy. Yet overall tensions with China appear set to stay elevated amid ongoing economic, technological and strategic competition – and we believe investors need exposures to both poles of global growth. Globalization rewired, one of the three key investment themes introduced in our 2021 Global Outlook, is about an acceleration of geopolitical transformations. At its center: a bi-polar U.S.-China world order and the remapping of global supply chains. This is not the same as deglobalization. Clear changes ahead We expect a clear change of tenor and tone in the Biden administration’s foreign policy approach, including a shift to working with allies on key issues: China, Russia, Iran, democracy and cyber security. The Biden administration will likely use alliances with groups of countries to engage China. The nomination of veteran Asia specialist Kurt Campbell to serve the new role of Indo-Pacific Coordinator is a signal of such an approach – as well as the administration’s expectation that intense competition is likely to dominate U.S.-China relations. This is taking place as China has emerged stronger from 2020 with its successful containment of the virus and a lead in the economic restart. It has also signed important trade deals including an investment agreement with the European Union, and a regional free trade agreement with Asia-Pacific nations including Japan and South Korea. Climate action Climate is likely to become a central policy priority under the Biden administration – and an area for potential cooperation in U.S.-China relations amid broader tensions around trade and human rights. Frictions may extend to the financial arena, as evidenced in the forced delisting of some Chinese companies in the U.S. market. We see this as a reason for carefully implementing China exposures, perhaps including consideration of greater direct allocations to China-listed securities over time. Yet how to implement China exposures will depend on investor constraints, including political and legal ones. Portfolio insights Strategically, we see assets exposed to Chinese growth as core holdings that are distinct from emerging market exposures. Tactically, we are overweight Asia ex-Japan equities as many Asian countries have been more effective at containing the virus and are further ahead in the economic restart. Risks to China-exposed assets include China’s high debt levels, currency volatility and heightened U.S.-China conflicts. But we believe investors are well compensated for these. BlackRock’s 2021 investment themes The new nominal We see stronger growth and lower real yields as the vaccine-led restart accelerates and central banks limit nominal yields gains even as inflation expectations climb. Inflation will likely have different implications to the past. Strategic implication: We are underweight government bonds and see equities supported by falling real rates. Tactical implication: Our low rate outlook keeps us pro-risk. We like U.S. equities and prefer high yield for income. The first half of 2021 is likely to be choppy. The pandemic challenges public health and the activity restart, while we see more policy support in the U.S. on top of the recent $900 billion fiscal package. We prefer a barbell approach to risk exposures, with selected cyclicals such as U.S. small-caps and emerging market equities on one end and quality assets including U.S. and Asia ex-Japan equities on the other. We also like tech and healthcare. These sectors can benefit from structural trends turbocharged by the pandemic, in our view, and their strong balance sheets and cash flows help provide some resilience against volatility. Yet we recognize U.S. tech could face challenges from greater regulation and corporate taxes. We remain pro-risk overall, favoring overweights in both equities and credit, but see a potentially bumpy path for asset prices broadly, especially as markets have moved a lot since we published our 2021 global outlook in early December. Globalization rewired Covid-19 has accelerated geopolitical transformations such as a bipolar U.S.-China world order and a remaking of global supply chains, placing greater weight on resilience – even at the expense of efficiency. Strategic implication: We favor deliberate country diversification and above-benchmark China exposures. Tactical implication: We like EM equities, especially Asia ex-Japan, and are underweight Europe and Japan. Turbocharged transformations The pandemic has added fuel to pre-existing structural trends such as an increased focus on sustainability, rising inequality within and across nations, and the dominance of e-commerce at the expense of traditional retail. Strategic implication: We prefer sustainable assets amid a growing societal preference for sustainability.

       "  'abstract': 'Amer Bisat and Karen Leiton engage the issue of “what is the optimal emerging markets allocation,” using three critical lenses to provide insight on the topic.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Below are highlights from the full report which goes into greater detail on our views on optimal emerging markets (EM) allocation.In this Emerging Markets Special Topics commentary, we engage the issue of “What is the optimal emerging markets (EM) allocation in a global portfolio?,” which is a question we are frequently asked by clients and consultants. Unfortunately, there is no one way to answer the question, so here we try to approach it from multiple angles. These include examining both fundamental economic and market-based approaches to sizing an emerging markets allocation. In our view, no matter how you cut it, there is an argument that investors are currently underinvested in EM. All three methods we examine in this commentary suggest that the optimal EM share in global portfolios is well above what most allocators currently hold. GDP-weighted Approach to EM Allocation The first approach we examine posits that the size of EM’s allocation in a global portfolio should reflect its relative size in the global economy. The intuition here is that a portfolio of financial assets should mirror the “real” economic importance of its constituents. As such, there are two ways to measure EM’s relative economic importance: EM’s outright share of global GDP (measured in USD), or alternatively EM’s contribution to global GDP growth. In sum, EM presently accounts for a 41% share of global GDP and has been contributing 43% to each year’s global economic growth. Clearly, in recent decades those numbers are dominated by one country: China. Excluding China, EM’s share in global GDP drops to 23% while its contribution to growth falls to 38%. Mean-variance Optimization Approach to EM Allocation Another approach to estimating the optimal EM allocation is to run traditional mean-variance optimizations using historical returns and volatility. That approach calculates the EM weighting that maximizes return while minimizing volatility. In the calculations, we used monthly return data since 1999 and performed the analysis separately for a pure equity portfolio and for a pure fixed income portfolio. For equities, we built a portfolio that included four indices: U.S. equities (S&P 500), European equities (EUR Stoxx), Japanese equities (the Nikkei index) and Emerging Market Equities (MSCI Emerging Markets index). Moreover, for EM, we ran the analysis separately for a portfolio that includes China and one that excludes it. The results for the analysis are displayed in the full report. The quantitative exercise would suggest that the optimal allocation for an equity portfolio is 8% of EM with China included, and excluding China, the share rises slightly to 9%. Allocation approach based on EM’s share in global market indices The final approach to understanding what the optimal emerging markets portfolio allocation may be examines the share of EM in global indices. Our intuition here is that the asset allocation should arguably be driven by the size of EM tradable securities in global financial markets. The broadest metric we looked at includes the ratio of all listed EM issuers. Using that broad definition, listed EM companies have an equity market capitalization equivalent to 31% of global stock market capitalization, and excluding China, the share is around 16%. In fixed income, EM’s share comes to 23% and 10% if one were to exclude China, according to Bank of America research1. However, in our view, the above metric is too broad since it does not control for liquidity, free-float and issue size. We used MSCI and Bloomberg indices to account for those factors. More specifically, for equities, the data shows that the share of EM in MSCI ACWI comes to 11% (8% excluding China). For fixed income, EM accounts for 12% of the Bloomberg Global Bond Aggregate index (IG, HY, Inflation linked, Munis) and ex-China that ratio drops to 8%. The first approach relies on the “real” economic weight of EM. Unadjusted, the approach pointed to an allocation of 40% for EM (including China). However, our quantitative estimate of growth-detracting adjustments suggested to an optimal EM allocation closer to 30%. The second method, based on optimizations of historical returns and volatility, suggested an EM allocation of around 9% for EM equities and another 10% for fixed income. Finally, the third method looked at EM’s index market share. Adjusted for liquidity and other market depth considerations, the resultant optimal EM allocation is around 12% for both equities and bonds. How do those methods compare to actual holdings by investors? For equities, available data suggest an allocation to EM equities of around 6.4%2. For fixed income, available data3 for European investors suggest an average EM allocation of 5% while for US investors, the estimate is around 1-2%. In a separate analysis of the largest global bond funds holdings, J.P. Morgan found that two-thirds of the funds have less than 10% of AUM in EM government debt4. Therefore, in our view, all three methods above suggest that the optimal share of EM in global portfolios is well above what most allocators currently own. '},\n",

But history is instructive, and it tells us that times of pain can be ideal moments to position for future gains. As the second half begins, we see: Market direction driven by Fed machinations Need for diversification and resilience in equity portfolios An underappreciated opportunity in healthcare stocks Market overview and outlook The first five months of the year marked the worst start for the S&P 500 since 1970 ― and the sixth worst back to 1928.* While caution is warranted, we believe the equity risk premium (ERP) continues to make a case for equities. Stock valuations have come down, but company earnings remain solid. This keeps the ERP ― which compares the earnings yield on the S&P 500 to bond yields ― above its historical average. Our models suggest the 10-year Treasury yield would have to rise to 4% or earnings decline by more than 20% for the perceived “margin of safety” in stocks over bonds to disappear. Earnings will slow, but 20% is hard to imagine, even in a recession. The average earnings drop in prior recessions was 13%, with the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) skewing the results. See chart below. All eyes on earningsS&P 500 earnings decline in recessions, 1957-2020 Playing offense through defense While it is important to maintain a long-term lens, particularly when investing for long-term goals, it is also prudent to protect and position portfolios for the prevailing environment ― a key advantage of active management. Today’s uncertainty argues for a focus on stability and resilience. Waiting on the Fed The Fed’s ability to raise interest rates and reduce its balance sheet in a way that neither inflames inflation nor stifles economic growth will have significant bearing on the market backdrop. We are not calling for a recession, but we are cognizant that the risks of a recession are rising: The Fed is tightening monetary policy, bringing an end to “easy money” policies; 30-year mortgage rates have climbed from 3% last year to nearly 6% today; inflation is beginning to erode household savings; and inventories of goods are elevated as both pandemic-induced supply shortages and voracious demand ease. If the Fed tightens too much, the result could be a recession. If it tightens too little, inflation is the greater threat. The ideal scenario runs in the middle, allowing for a soft landing as policy transitions. We are not placing odds on any particular outcome but are generally positioning more defensively. The optimal portfolio to combat inflation is very different from the optimal portfolio for a recession. We advocate using a barbell strategy to position for these competing outcomes. This includes owning energy and financials as inflation fighters, and healthcare for a dose of resilience. We find other traditionally defensive sectors, including utilities and staples, to be expensive relative to the broader market. The weight of inflation Notably, our analysis of sector dynamics during the Great Inflation period of the 1970s found energy, financials and healthcare to be the top performers. While the backdrop is different today, we do believe these three sectors could outpace the broader market once again, with financials potentially doing even better in this cycle given stronger bank balance sheets after restructuring and rigorous stress testing in the wake of the GFC. Inflation surfaced as the perceived greatest risk to equity markets over the next six months in a BlackRock Fundamental Equities survey of more than 1,000 U.S. investors. See chart below.

Pricing pressures abound Global prices for everything from oil and gasoline to cereal and milk are significantly higher this year, escalating pressure on consumers and companies alike. Median global inflation is nearly 8% vs. approximately 3% a year ago1, and the high absolute level of inflation will have lasting effects. High and persistent inflation can become more difficult to eliminate outside of a recession, and those risks are important to assessing credit fundamentals. No longer a rising tide Regime change is difficult to quantify, especially when it is occurring in real time. And yet the shift in monetary policy of both higher interest rates, an end to asset purchases, and in particular a reduction to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet highlight a significant policy shift in response to the highest inflation levels experienced in 40 years. A variable but persistent tailwind of the last many years which has come to an end, and now we’ll see what businesses are truly ready to withstand tightening financial conditions. Winners and losers As companies react to higher input and financing costs, the idiosyncrasies of individual business models begins to diverge. At a time of slowing economic growth, the risks and opportunities can be more pronounced, and offer greater alpha potential to those able to navigate them. Navigating greater uncertainty A wider distribution of outcomes is a function of more uncertainty.

Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product\\'s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

       "  'content': ' Read details of our midyear outlook: The Great Moderation is over The Great Moderation, from mid-1980s until 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, was a remarkable period of stability of both growth and inflation. We were in a demand-driven economy with steadily growing supply. Borrowing binges drove overheating, while collapsing spending drove recessions. Central banks could mitigate both by either raising or cutting rates. That period has ended, in our view. Bracing for volatility This new market environment has echoes of the early 1980s. We are bracing for volatility in this regime. Central banks are rushing to raise rates to contain inflation that’s rooted in production constraints. They are not acknowledging the stark trade-off: crush economic growth or live with inflation. The Fed, for one, is likely to choke off the restart of economic activity - and only change course when the damage emerges. We see this driving high macro and market volatility, with short economic cycles. Equities would suffer if rate hikes trigger a growth downturn. If policymakers tolerate more inflation, bond prices would fall. Either way, the macro backdrop is no longer conducive for a sustained bull market in both stocks and bonds, we believe. We see higher risk premia across the board and think portfolio allocations will need to become more granular and nimble. Living with inflation We think we will be living with inflation. For all the noise about containing inflation, we see policymakers ultimately living with some of it. We remain overweight equities and underweight government bonds in long-term portfolios. We expect investors to demand more compensation to hold long-term bonds in this new regime. We see a high risk of growth stalling and reduce equities to underweight. We now prefer to take risk in credit because we don’t see contained default risk. Positioning for net zero We see the bumpy transition to net-zero carbon emissions shaping the new regime – and believe investors should start positioning for net zero. We think investors can be bullish on both fossil fuels and sustainable assets, as we see a key role for commodities in the transition. Yet our work finds that changing societal preferences can give sustainable assets a return advantage for years to come. Ready to shift views We stay pro-equities on a strategic horizon but are underweight in the short run. Biases built up during the Great Moderation, like buying risk asset dips, won’t work as well as before, in our view. A new regime of greater macro volatility, shorter cycles and more volatile markets, means a dynamic approach to portfolio positioning. Our conviction is that portfolios will need to change more quickly. Ready to shift views Our conviction is that portfolios will need to change more quickly.

       "  'content': ' Historically, roughly every 30 years, a Category 5 hurricane has made landfall in the United States. Only five such hurricanes have ever made landfall since record-keeping began; such is their rarity. The physical damage that such storms cause is devastating, as evidenced by hurricanes like 2005’s Katrina (which made landfall as a Cat 3), or even 2012’s Sandy in NYC, “just” a Cat 1 storm. Financial hurricanes, on the other hand, can cause devastating monetary losses, even as physical losses are (fortunately) minimal. Today, we find ourselves in the midst of a unique financial hurricane: since at least 2000, there has never been a year when both the Bloomberg-Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and the S&P 500 Index of large capitalization equities were negative (which is where we stand in 2022, as of May 10, see Figure 1), and since the creation of the U.S. Long Treasury Agg in 1973, there hasn’t been a year when both stocks and long bonds were down double digits (as they currently stand this year). While there are still too many unknowns for us to say that this is a Category 5 equivalent, like the Global Financial Crisis or like the Great Depression, it is nonetheless a unique and complex “5 category” hurricane, encompassing: 1) inflation (globally, but especially in the U.S.), 2) China lockdowns (and the evolution of policy), 3) the war in Ukraine (and its impact on commodity prices), 4) recession fears (especially in Europe) and 5) a Federal Reserve (Fed) that is tightening financial conditions at the fastest pace in decades. We will examine each of these categories, in turn, and will conclude with thoughts on how to allocate capital in the midst of this storm, in a sense, how to “polish your surfboard” in preparation for the opportunities that should arise once the tempest has calmed. Figure 1: Stock and bond returns are indicative of a rare financial hurricane this year Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 31, 2022 Inflation (globally, but particularly in the U.S.) There is no shortage of reasons for inflation’s push higher this year – commodity shortages due to the war in Ukraine, continued demand for housing amidst strong fundamentals and low inventory and fresh lockdowns in China creating new waves of supply chain issues. Still, there are reasons to believe that several important components may have already peaked. While Chinese ports are backed up, congestion around U.S. ports has eased. Copper is now below where it was a year ago, and the U.S. oil and gas rig count has almost recovered to pre-Covid levels after plunging by 70% during the pandemic, incentivized by the economics of $100-a-barrel oil this year. House prices are almost certain to slow their advance too, in light of mortgage rates that have now surpassed their 2018 peak. While inflation has shown some signs of peaking, its stickiness at this high a level (2022 is likely to average 6.9% according to the Bloomberg consensus) is still a problem for the Fed, and hence for markets (see Figure 2). Figure 2: 2022 inflation expectations are trending in the wrong direction for the Fed Source: Bloomberg, data as of April 26, 2022 Lockdowns in China, and the evolution of policy The global growth impulse from China is especially complex because while it takes the form of a negative supply shock to the U.S.; it is primarily a negative demand shock in China. City-wide lockdowns have virtually ceased day-to-day activities, leading to renewed disruption and delays at the ports, further clogging parts of the global supply chain (see Figure 3). The unclear trajectory of economic growth, Covid developments, as well as uncertain regulatory and geopolitical conditions surrounding China, have led to a great set of uncertainties for investors. Figure 3: Relentless shipping delays are leading to global cost pressures Sources: Goldman Sachs and Freightos, data as of March 22, 2022 The continuing challenge from the Ukraine-Russia situation Wheat, natural gas, crude oil, and a variety of other commodities continue to be buffeted by the interruption to the global commodity trade. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in European natural gas prices (see Figure 4). This near-immediate breakage of trade relations with a major global trading partner may have instigated a “deglobalization wave” that is now being exacerbated by Chinese lockdowns and their associated supply chain disruptions. This deglobalization wave is also creating a tug-of-war in the composition of nominal GDP (as smaller trade quantities create higher prices), which could create business interruptions, a longer-term stickiness to inflation and hence further geopolitical tensions. Yet, putting geopolitics aside, an investor can justifiably feel more comfortable with investments in areas tangential to this concept of a stickier supply environment for commodities. Figure 4: European natural gas prices are up 440% over the past year Source: Bloomberg, data as of May 2, 2022 Potential U.S. recession? Recession has been a buzzword ever since the yield curve inverted in early 2022. Forecasts suggest that the likelihood of a recession has increased dramatically since the beginning of the year, for both the U.S. and for Europe. Simultaneously, consumer confidence has trended downward, largely due to inflation concerns, an ill omen for consumption-oriented economies. Yet there is a labor market-sized hole in the theory of a U.S. recession. The shortages of goods and commodities from abroad extends to a shortage of workers domestically, creating one of the tightest labor markets in history. Not only does a tight labor market continue to support robust consumption, but ironically, this labor shortage and short-term inflationary impulse creates the need for investment in automation and other productivity-enhancing technology that will ultimately be disinflationary in the long run. While both the labor market and corporate investment activity are highly likely to slow from their unsustainably torrid pace, they are unlikely to grind to a halt. In fact, it is quite likely that the labor market stays strong enough for long enough for tomorrow’s businesses and consumers to enjoy the fruits of today’s investments. Interestingly, the tightest labor market in history is also coinciding with U.S. household financial health that is the best in modern history. While sentiment readings may be poor (e.g., consumer confidence), spending is quite the opposite. Through the pandemic, consumers have, on average, paid down debt and grown cash balances. Households saved about $5 trillion during the pandemic, $2.5 trillion of which is now pent-up excess savings. Through March 2022, households have only drawn down about $30 billion from this $2.5 trillion excess savings hoard, leaving plenty of dry powder to absorb price increases without having to change consumption patterns as much as net debt burdens would have suggested in prior cycles. Figure 5: US households could now theoretically repay all indebtedness with cash Source: Federal Reserve, data as of December 31, 2021 So, the data doesn’t suggest an imminent recession in the U.S., but does policy have to reverse its course of the last three years at a speed that ends up engineering an economic downturn in the fight against inflation? That would seem irrational to us, but markets won’t know the ultimate answer for a few months (making for a highly conditional investing environment, as explained in our last Market Insights commentary (If…Then, Making Sense of Uncertainty in Markets). The U.S. is already feeling some of the effects of the hurricane in the goods economy, albeit in what is a well-built house with a strong foundation. The combination of high goods prices and a natural rotation back to services spending (leading to less goods sector demand) could likely spell a goods recession; the good news for the U.S. is that this is only about 20% of GDP and the strength of the other 80% should be more than enough to offset this weakness at the headline level. Markets like one-word answers to complex problems, and it’s possible they may focus on manufacturing’s implied growth slowdown for a few months, but a manufacturing survey is not the tell-all of a much more complex (and more durable) economy (see Figure 6). Figure 6: High goods prices portend manufacturing slowdowns Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics and Institute for Supply Management, data as of March 31, 2022 However, the situation is much different in Europe and China. While the U.S. economy benefits from its services-heavy makeup, its lack of external exposure and its status as an energy exporter, Europe and China do not enjoy such luxuries. Uncertainty around Eurozone and global earnings adds to the challenges of managing a global portfolio (see Figure 7). Positioning today should reflect the fear of at least some slowing global data pervading investor psyche. While being right about an economic forecast is intellectually gratifying, preserving capital by protecting downside in the short-term, while setting up for future upside (polishing one’s surfboard in a hurricane), is more important than being ultimately right on the timing or depth of a potential economic slowdown. Figure 7: Estimates suggest that 40% global earnings growth could become a 16% contraction Source: Piper Sandler, data as of May 3, 2022 Monetary Policy While the absolute highs of inflation are likely behind us, inflation is still much too high and central banks are still much too far behind the curve. The implications are that the Fed will need to continue aggressively tightening monetary policy. While supply chains and geopolitics are out of the Fed’s control, they cannot afford to let house prices rise unabatedly, in a repeat of 2006-07, nor can they let elevated inflation expectations become engrained (see Figure 8). Hence, they are forced to continue down a hawkish path. Figure 8: The food and energy shock has created awful optics between policy rate settings relative to prices Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, data as of March 31, 2022, and Bloomberg, data as of April 28, 2022 While we have probably already seen most of the repricing in the Treasury market, particularly further out the curve, it is hard to bet on interest rates moving materially lower. The path of forward Fed rate hikes is fairly certain over the next few quarters and is well-priced by markets. In contrast, the path forward for both global and domestic central bank liquidity is highly uncertain, and the tail risks for markets are more significant than the broad economy. If liquidity is suddenly contracted proactively (central banks reduce the size of their balance sheets by effectively net selling Treasuries), it removes critical support for the financial economy. Importantly, this process is not linear but is digital, such that credit markets can quickly lurch from “smoothly functioning” to “shuttered.” It is possible that the disruption of smoothly functioning financial markets leads the Fed to stop tightening well before inflation decelerates to its 2% target, which would implicitly signal that the Fed is comfortable with a slightly higher inflation target. Indeed, a broader view of financial conditions today suggests that they are closer to longer term averages than the policy rate alone would suggest (see Figure 9). Credit spreads, the U.S. dollar and an equity repricing have combined to tighten financial conditions by the most since 2018, at an annual pace seen only three other times in the last decade. While it may be necessary to tighten financial conditions even further as a late play to arrest runaway inflation, prolonged tightness in excess of prior peaks could be onerous enough to cause a capital market shutdown. Figure 9: The rapid tightening in financial conditions is more broad-based than the policy rate alone Source: Goldman Sachs, data as of April 25, 2022 Asset allocation in a hurricane During a financial hurricane, an investor’s goal of capital appreciation may need to take a back seat to the goal of capital preservation. An overweight cash allocation can go a long way toward preserving capital, and allowing for future buying opportunities at better prices, a theme that has certainly played out over the last year in fixed income markets. However, we are now getting to a point where deploying some of that cash makes sense, especially in high quality fixed income (Figure 10). Figure 10: The front end has been a safe haven, while the index is having its worst drawdown since the 1970s Source: Bloomberg, data as of April 26, 2022 Some parts of credit markets do also look interesting from a historical perspective, but this is mostly in the investment grade space, and largely due to the simultaneous widening in rates and spreads, pushing yields to their 99th percentile over the period of the last decade. In the lower quality parts of fixed income (high yield), spreads at their 40th percentile haven’t widened sufficiently to compensate investors for the risk of this financial hurricane being worse than expected. This pattern of higher quality assets having better forward return profiles is true in securitized markets as well – high quality CMBS, CLO and ABS spreads have widened more than their low-quality counterparts would suggest. At the bottom of the capital stack, in equities, robust fundamentals and earnings that should benefit from a high nominal GDP environment are in a tug-of-war with valuations that are now at the low end of their range of over the last two decades. On a relative basis, the repricing in credit markets has rendered once attractive free-cash-flow yields in equities as “just okay” today (not because cash flows per se are in question, but due to the dramatically rising discount rate against which future cash flows are measured, see Figure 11). Figure 11: Free-cash-flow yields are the least attractive relative to credit than any time since 2009 Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 31, 2022 During a hurricane of global liquidity contraction, the accompanying volatility can provide for excellent entry points in equities, especially in sectors with stable cash flows that are being liquidated by those in need of cash (see Figure 12). In just the last few weeks, these technical conditions may have resulted in certain equities already undershooting “fair value.” Figure 12: Lower liquidity leads to higher volatility (usually to the downside…) Sources: Bloomberg and Federal Reserve, data as of March 31, 2022 Further, as the hurricane passes through and is on the verge of ending, it is usually the best time to sell insurance. The price of insurance tends to be influenced by recency bias, and often overshoots the fair value of what it should cost to insure a portfolio from losses in tail-risk outcomes. The price of insurance has indeed risen rapidly in recent months: it costs 60% more to buy insurance against the S&P 500 declining 10% than it is to insure against a move higher by 10%, and the option market on some of the largest companies in the world is implying that they move by 40% over the next year – a gain or loss of a whopping $1 trillion in market cap in Apple, for example. In fixed income, the option market is suggesting a 68% chance of a 1.5% move in the 2-year swap rate – a huge range of 2% to 5% given its 3.5% starting point. All things considered, insurance premiums may be one of the most attractive sources of income today (while still allowing one to hold cash), but an investor must make sure to sell insurance only on assets that one would be happy to own at lower prices. Eventually, this financial hurricane too shall pass. During the last two hiking cycles, returns from the second hike to the equivalent policy rate that is being priced by year-end 2022 were accompanied by uniformly positive returns (see Figure 13). The current cycle has more crosscurrents, but we cannot rule out the potential for a rebound in financial assets given the amount of price adjustment that we have just witnessed in the first several months of 2022. So, we think investors would be well advised to find a safe place for this hurricane to pass, but do not stay in that place forever, because when we have enough visibility to know that the hurricane is indeed moving on, some spectacular returns could follow in its wake.

       "  'content': ' For some time now, co-investing covers one of the fastest growing strategies within private market investing. Co-investments, typically alongside private equity managers, offer sophisticated institutional investors and high net-worth individuals the opportunity to gain faster and greater exposure to attractive assets but at better terms — thus providing the potential to achieve more attractive returns. Additionally, and especially when investing in a well-diversified portfolio of co-investments, investors are more diversified across deals and sponsors, thereby decreasing the overall risk and potentially improving risk-adjusted returns even further. Investors or limited partners (LPs) are increasingly enticed by co-investments’ potential for higher expected returns, which is largely a function of lower fees. Providers not only charge lower management and performance fees but also offer risk management benefits, such as additional due diligence, active portfolio construction and a broader diversification across assets. In a syndication process, a general partner (GP) has already closed or is in the process of closing an investment prior to offering co-invest. Syndication processes are typically expedited since the GP has already negotiated the final terms of the transaction. Syndicated co-investments may be available to small investors who can react quickly. The information received in terms of due diligence materials are standardized with limited ability by the LP to shape diligence or the transaction terms. Typically, a GP may approach a sophisticated LP to go after an asset together where deal dynamics are uncertain and the asset may not be won. The LP needs to have a team with direct transaction experience who can sign equity commitment letters in pre-bid situations. The GP looks for an LP who is respectful of timelines, has an experienced team with deep domain expertise. LP has much stronger influence on the transaction structure, pricing and terms, as well as deeper insights into the transaction. Probability distributions of net multiples The figures shown relate to past performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. Source: BlackRock as of 30 June 2021. For additional details on the simulation please refer to the appendix. Visually, the above graphic shows that the left tail of the probability distributions is truncated dramatically when moving from primary funds to synthetic and to actual co-investment funds while offering more upside in the right tail. This clearly speaks for very strong risk-adjusted returns and explains in part the success and growth of co-investments. This work lays out the growth and evolution of the private equity co-investment market in addition to providing an empirical analysis of simulated co-investment funds compared to traditional primary funds across various market cycles. In a search for alpha, institutional investors have increased allocations to private equity in order to meet return targets. In this quest for alpha, investors have increasingly turned to co-investments to better control portfolio construction in addition to obtaining access to attractive investments at an improved fee basis. This paper finds the market still has room to grow given the advantages to both the GP and the LP taking into consideration the performance impact of the private equity premium, fee savings and selection of investments.

       "  'content': \" As a result of the growth of private markets, there is an increasing need to take a more holistic and analytical approach in building private market portfolios, benefitting from the various investment types available and differentiating between more alpha oriented strategies in private markets. For most institutional investors, primary fund commitments form the fundamental component of a well-planned, scalable and diversified private equity program. Opportunistic strategies such as secondaries and co-investments are derived from primaries and now provide a more nuanced approach to construct a private equity program. We focus on these investment types within the private equity market, although we will also touch on the blurring of lines between private equity and other asset classes, as well as overlaps between these investment types. We highlight the benefits of both secondaries and co-investments in a broader private equity portfolio and perform quantitative analyses to examine how these investment types impact performance, pacing, J-curve mitigation and risk-reward characteristics.

We find that a balanced, thoughtfully constructed program of primaries, secondaries and co-investments offers clear synergies and has the potential to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns beyond what each of the three transaction types can achieve in isolation. Ultimately, each investor has their own objectives, hence the optimal mix across transaction types, strategies and geographies will depend on those objectives. \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Many factors may be contributing to inflation, but one structural cause could be an aging population. BlackRock’s Global CIO of Multi-Asset Solutions examines the demographic drivers of inflation and ways to position portfolios.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Much has been made about how inflation—after being in a slumber for more than a decade—has come roaring back. Consumers have seen the prices of things like gasoline, produce, furniture and used cars spike higher, which erodes the value of wages and crimped spending power on a day-to-day basis. Conversations globally have attributed the sudden resurgence of inflation on everything from a green-energy transition to pent-up demand and supply-chain issues. A deeper structural issue that can’t be ignored is an aging global population. The world is getting older. According to 2020 United Nations data, the number of people aged 65 and older is projected to more than double between 2020 and 2050 and reach over 1.5 billion by 2050. That compares with about 727 million in 2020. The fastest growing demographic is actually those in their 80s and older.1 The world is getting older United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Data retrieved in February 2022. Such a seismic demographic shift could bring about profound macroeconomic and investment implications. From a macroeconomic perspective, the significance of an aging society for inflation is visible mainly through two channels. Such trends will likely be associated with a drop in the labour force globally. This development would be the opposite from what we have seen in the last 30-40 years. In their 2020 book, The Great Demographic Reversal, Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan describe a “demographic sweet spot” as one in which the labour force is growing. But on the flipside, the reality of an aging population means the available pool of labour in advanced economies may be declining. A reduction in the share of workers can lead to labour shortages, which may raise the bargaining power of employees and lift wages—all of which is ultimately inflationary. An aging population could further shrink the labor force The World Bank, International Labour Organization. Data as of 21 March 2022. While this has been largely known and observed by economists and demographers for some time, the more striking development in recent years has been that a similar pattern is emerging in some developing economies like China, with signs of worker populations there also shrinking. This is critical because it implies advanced economies may start to struggle to “import” labour from such places either via migration or sourcing goods. The second significant effect of an aging society is a higher percentage of the workforce may be needed in the care sector. This happens to be a sector that is less likely to see efficiency improvements and the disinflationary effects from technology. Basically, it is easier to build an algorithm to automate clerical work than to build a robot than can take care of a human being. Our central scenario for the medium-term is that on average inflation will likely remain higher than in the years post-financial crisis due to structural forces, like the deglobalization trend meant to secure supply chains, the move toward sustainability, as well as this aging population phenomena. So with this more medium-term picture for inflation, it is key to ensure that investment portfolios are well positioned to reflect such a trend. BlackRock’s Multi-Asset Strategies & Solutions group has put our views into practice by maintaining a structurally long position in inflation-linked bonds globally. For portfolios that allow investment in private assets, we see potential in investing in infrastructure assets with a contractual revenue link to inflation. Commodities can also play a role as a hedge for inflation, although not all commodities are created equal. Our team’s proprietary research that was published last year and academic evidence indicate that energy has the strongest inflation-protection benefits, followed by industrial metals and finally agriculture and livestock. There was so much debate early last year over whether inflation will be “sticky” or merely “transitory”. But signs persist that inflation could be part of the economic backdrop for some time, for reasons including the demographic transition I just discussed. Ultimately, this will continue to shape how the investment community thinks about portfolio positioning and construction. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' With inflation at the highest level in decades and interest rates on the rise, equity investors are questioning their next moves. In fact, more than three in five Americans view inflation as the biggest risk facing the U.S. stock market over the next six months, according to a recent BlackRock Fundamental Equities survey of more than 1,000 individual investors.* U.S. Fundamental Equities CIO Tony DeSpirito offers timely perspective. What is the current state of inflation? The Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading of 7.9% as of February represents the highest headline inflation level since 1982. Core CPI, which excludes volatile components such as food and energy, registered at 6.4%. This comes after core inflation has lingered around 2% or below since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008. The COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing recovery have fueled the sharp uptick. An unprecedented and disruptive economic shutdown/reopen cycle has left the supply of goods low and consumer demand for them high as coincident fiscal and monetary stimulus helped to pad pocketbooks and set up a strong spending cycle. Intermittent factory closures around the world, which are continuing with the most recent outbreak of COVID in China, have upset global supply chains and exacerbated the imbalance. The war in Ukraine is only going to add to inflationary pressures. What is your outlook for inflation? We do not see inflation sustaining at the current decades-high level over the long-term, but we do expect it will settle into a range higher than the sub-2% seen in the post-GFC period. This is because some inflation, such as shelter and services inflation, is “sticky” ― meaning it will not work its way out as easily as other inflationary pressures where a rebalance of supply and demand will naturally create price stability. We could see inflation move toward its new long-run trend starting in the second half of this year. If we use the Atlanta Fed’s “Sticky CPI” gauge as the worst-case predictor, we estimate that could put inflation in the 3%-4% range. How have stocks historically fared amid rising inflation? We believe stocks are one of the best places to be in a rising inflation world. Our review of data back to the 1920s finds that equities perform well as long as inflation isn’t out of control ― over 10%, which is historically rare and not our expectation even in this unusual cycle. In above-average inflation environments (5%-10%), value stocks have performed particularly well. What allows value stocks to do better? If you think about investing time horizon, the expectation is that a value stock will return capital to shareholders faster than a growth stock. This is because, by definition, much of the expected cash flows from lower-multiple (value) stocks is front-end loaded. Conversely, growth stocks are considered longer-duration assets with expectations of greater cash flows further into the future. In essence, a higher proportion of the stock’s price comes from far-off cash flows, and that gets discounted by higher rates. This gives value stocks, with more stable near-term cash flows, an upper hand in an inflating environment. In an analysis of growth versus value using data since 1927, we found value has achieved greatest outperformance in periods of moderate to high inflation. It is only when inflation was very low that value performance paled. (See chart below.) A historically strong showing as inflation rises Value outperformance by inflation regime, 1927-2020 Source: BlackRock, with data from the Kenneth R. French Data Library and from Robert J. Shiller. Fama/French data uses the CRSP universe, which includes all companies incorporated in the U.S. and listed on the NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ exchanges. The level of annual inflation is defined as the year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). “Lowest inflation” represents the bottom 20 years of inflation readings; “highest inflation” represents the top 20 years; and “middling inflation” represents the remainder. The numbers below represent the range in inflation readings for each regime. Value outperformance is annualized and calculated across various inflation regimes using annual data from 1927 to 2020. Value outperformance represents the performance of value stocks minus growth stocks, as defined by the Fama/French HML research factor (i.e., “high valuation minus low valuation” using book to price). What does higher inflation mean for growth stocks? Low interest rates and tame inflation in the years after the GFC were a boon for longer-duration assets, including growth stocks. We’ve seen the drag on growth stock performance early this year as the market priced in the impact of higher rates to fight inflation. The flip side is that this dynamic does nothing to dilute the innovation that is powering many of these companies, particularly the proven business models with durable growth characteristics. In many cases, the sell-off was indiscriminate. This suggests many growth stocks, especially those unduly punished beyond what the fundamentals suggest, could present a good value for long-term investors. Which sectors have done well in inflationary times? We’ve done a lot of work around how different sectors and industries have performed in prior inflationary environments, particularly the last critical period centered around the 1970s. Sectors that performed the best included energy, healthcare and financials. Among those that performed the worst: consumer discretionary/staples, utilities and materials. While we don’t see high inflation persisting for the extended length of time that it did five decades ago, we see some sector-level patterns that could repeat (or rhyme), and others where it is less likely. Our findings are summarized in the table below. Source: BlackRock Fundamental Equities, with data from S&P and Russell indices, March 2022.

A stock-by-stock approach Companies generally have been able to manage higher costs, exhibiting pricing power and a willingness to invest in cost-saving measures to propel their businesses forward.

       "  'abstract': 'Every one of the ugliest, headline-grabbing “if, then” scenarios for the global economy and markets has reasonable odds of going the other way to create a rather benign outcome.',\n",
       "  'content': ' It’s quite easy to paint an apocalyptic picture for the global economy these days. If the war in Ukraine were to escalate, skyrocketing commodity inflation could ensue; and if China were to continue to pursue a Zero Covid policy amidst rising case counts, supply chains originating in Asia could get shut down again. Paying higher prices for dwindling quantities would send stagflationary alarm bells ringing through newspaper headlines, even more than they already are. Further, if U.S. consumption were to nonetheless stay strong, despite the cost-push inflation, buoyed by savings and pent-up demand, then the Federal Reserve (Fed) may be emboldened to tighten policy beyond neutral levels, or to withdraw liquidity at a pace that would hold real economic implications. And if the Fed were to aggressively do “whatever it takes” to kill off the recent spike higher in inflation, then a negative feedback loop could form with consumption slowing and financial markets deflating (with recession fears replacing stagflation fears). Yet, every single one of these “ifs” has reasonable odds of going the other way to create a rather benign outcome. If some sort of resolution were to be found in Ukraine, and if China were to pursue an optimization policy oriented around economic stability, then supply-driven, cost-push, inflation could be tamed more naturally. If U.S. consumption were to go from great to merely good, in sympathy with the higher prices already in the system, the Fed could take policy to neutral judiciously, as opposed to quickly, with the luxury of time to then decide whether to go further or not, depending on how economic conditions unfold. The outcome of all this? Inflation expectations would be contained, and a positive feedback loop could form with a resumption of rising real growth, resulting in financial asset prices that would respond to real economy cues (stocks and bonds would complement each other in portfolios, as they historically have, rather than compound losses). Each permutation and combination of these “if/thens” (both ugly and benign) seems to have exerted its own gravitational pull on markets at some point this year, sometimes simultaneously, creating a great deal of uncertainty and a multi-directional backdrop for investing as dizzying and complex as an M.C. Escher staircase (see Figure 1). We think that the outcomes of the “ifs” in question are so extreme and far-reaching that perhaps an investor’s goal of capital appreciation should, for now, be balanced with that of capital preservation, until a few more data points provide some much-needed clarity on the trajectory of the global economy. Figure 1: Relativity, by M.C. Escher Indeed, it would have been very difficult to predict the unprecedented drawdown in fixed income indices, the quick entry and equally speedy exit of the Nasdaq into and out of a bear market, or that commodities, like oil and gold, would be the only major assets in the green through the first quarter of 2022. Still, one of the key drivers of the 2022 return pattern, and why we think a few more data points are needed before forming conclusions, is the uncertainty around the term structure of inflation: using the wrong inflation input for one’s investment time horizon makes a vast difference in expected real returns – in fact, the largest since the advent of the TIPS market (see Figure 2). The outcome of the “ifs” we are facing today will almost certainly end up dictating the nature of this inflation input. Figure 2: Implied real returns on most fixed income assets flip signs depending on the time horizon Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 25, 2022 The Russia-Ukraine War “If” Representing about 12% of both global calories traded and global energy supply, Russia and Ukraine have a significant combined influence on consumer price indices from New Jersey to New Delhi (see Figure 3). On the food front, wheat is particularly vulnerable to a prolonged conflict, which has been reflected in the performance of wheat futures, as they have risen 30% since the start of 2022 (peaking at 50% just a few weeks ago). Figure 3: Russia and Ukraine are large contributors to the global supply of crops and fertilizers Sources: Comtrade and International Food Policy Research Institute, data as of February 24, 2022 As for energy, there was already a substantial “if” around how high prices could go without destroying demand. While oil prices in developed markets are causing consternation, prices in some large emerging markets have reached nosebleed levels in recent weeks (see Figure 4). The unwillingness of companies to spend on capital expenditures (capex), having been scarred by prior episodes of overinvestment, is compounded now by uncertainty around the future of Russian supply, and may keep prices high enough, for long enough, so as to accelerate a longer-term transition to alternative sources of energy. Figure 4: The cure for high prices may be high prices Sources: Bloomberg and ICE, data as of March 18, 2022 The cost-push inflation “If” So, already sticky-high global inflation has been shocked higher, while persistent supply chain bottlenecks and de-globalization are threatening to become stark economic realities. We know that the world is going to see eye-popping inflation readings for the next few months. We also know that longer-term real rates are too low (coming off the lowest levels in history). However, if this near-term inflation shock were to last for a longer period of time than the market is expecting, then long-term nominal rates would have to rise significantly so as not to appear grossly mispriced (see Figure 5). Figure 5: Long-term nominal rates imply deeply negative real returns against short-term inflation Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 28, 2022 The stagflation “If” While food and fuel prices have reached staggering heights amidst geopolitical tensions, they are unlikely to impact the U.S. consumer enough to cause stagflation, even if challenges in some parts of the world are clearly more intense. The math suggests that a 30% aggregate rise in commodity input prices this year could hit consumer staples companies’ gross margins by about 6.4% - a material hit, to be sure, but not nearly a death blow. Should those companies pass on the entirety of that 6.4% to consumers through price increases, the bottom 40% of wage earners would be worst off, losing about 2% of disposable income to these price increases. That could translate into a loss of 0.7% of GDP for the U.S. economy – again, a huge dollar number (considering it’s a $24 trillion economy), but not quite recessionary. In fact, previous wartime and post-war dislocations look similar to the inflationary episode we are facing today (see Figure 6). Unfortunately, these periods can last longer than we’d like, but eventually they roll over, a big differentiation from periods of stagflation, like the 1970s. Figure 6: Wartime price shocks can initially threaten stagflation, but then roll over Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, data as of December 31, 1953 (originally), March 31, 2022 The consumption “If” If price gains in more modest-ticket necessities, like food, aren’t enough to derail the U.S. economy, what about the biggest-ticket necessities, like houses? With significantly higher house prices being met by rising mortgage rates, the concern of less affordable housing is real. Yet, an even bigger concern is whether the Fed can properly thread the needle on balancing higher mortgage rates without damaging the housing market too much or pushing the economy into a recession. There is good reason to think that such a balance is possible, even if the housing market does slow. While a housing slowdown will invite comparisons to the mid- 2000s, today’s market is the opposite of 2006: there is no available supply of homes, especially at reasonable prices (restricting forward demand), amidst the tightest labor market since at least 1970 (meaning reasonably priced homes that do come to market are likely to be snapped up, as displayed in Figure 7). Figure 7: Fewer homes and many jobs today vs. many homes and fewer jobs in 2006 Sources: Mortgage Bankers Association (LHS), data as of March 18, 2022, and Bloomberg (RHS), data as of February 28, 2022 While there are clearly dents in the armor of this post-pandemic economic resurgence, inevitably leading to some degree of economic slowdown, the starting point and backbone of this economy are quite historically prolific, rendering stagflation, recession, or the demise of the U.S. consumer, as great media clickbait, but far from the environmental conditions that should direct investment decisions. Follow Rick Rieder on Twitter The Fed “If” There is also a wide policy angle of attack in balancing higher levels of inflation and lower levels of growth. One of the Fed’s tools is moral suasion. Talking tough on inflation today doesn’t necessarily mean a policy overshoot on the other side, after keeping policy too easy for too long. Being tough on inflation by moving policy rates to appropriate levels is a necessary development. Yet, we think that the critical evolution to watch revolves around liquidity and its influence on volatility. While there is some truly excessive liquidity in the system at present, if too much is removed, too rapidly, it could create a systemic shock by deflating the prices of goods, services and financial assets, as quickly as it inflated them (see Figure 8). Figure 8: 42% of all U.S. M2 liquidity was created in the last 24 months Source: Bloomberg, data as of January 31, 2022 The Europe “If” Despite the grim situation in Ukraine and short-term headwinds in the rest of Europe, there is a case to be made for European assets to do well in the long term, if fiscal and monetary policy can work together virtuously to create an attractive environment for productive investment (particularly, in areas such as energy and defense). While near-term uncertainty and concern over the European economy could very well continue to pressure the euro, monetary policy that is targeted at inflation and fiscal policy supporting energy, climate and immigration (among others) could very well ultimately buoy the currency and attract tangible investment into the region over the intermediate-to-long-term (see Figure 9). Figure 9: Despite the undesirable mix, NGDP in Europe has been rising; still above-average real GDP Source: Bloomberg, data as of December 31, 2021 The economic “If/Thens” lead to a series of investing “If/Thens” Nobody has seen the losses we’ve just been through in many high-quality fixed income indices because these losses have not occurred since the inception of said indices (see Figure 10). The return-carnage in high quality assets this year is a result of a combination of very low yields over the last two years, and the amount of debt issued at those yields, giving fixed income a historically small cushion, alongside tightening monetary policy amidst the historically large shocks that we are experiencing today. A further anticipated tightening by the market, and/or unexpected withdrawal of liquidity by central banks will potentially make these drawdowns even worse. Figure 10: Largest drawdown in the history of the U.S. Treasury Agg Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 25, 2022 Although the near-term trend in investment flows can be negative, and the “if’s” are still very significant, one must consider the underlying supply/demand dynamics for financial assets today (see Figure 11): the need for financial assets (returns) exceeds financial liabilities (payout obligations). And with net worth growth slowing, but still quite high, the need/desire to earn a return on that net worth continues to be historically high. Figure 11: Global liquidity as a share of the Global Aggregate Index Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 24, 2022 We like accumulating assets that are offering a historically attractive return profile, such as the front-end of the high-quality fixed income market, the front-end and belly of credit markets (both Investment Grade and High Yield), municipal bonds, and even parts of emerging market hard currency debt that have taken a beating. These assets are near the cheapest they have been in a decade, and in the case of U.S. corporate credit, could even be considered cheap relative to equities (see Figure 12). Figure 12: U.S. credit screens as attractive relative to equities, a rare phenomenon Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 28, 2022 Note: The IG/HY Free Cash Flow Model takes the Free Cash Flow per share of the S&P 500 and divides it by the blended HY and IG yield to get an intrinsic value for the S&P 500 Yet, fixed income could get cheaper still in an environment fraught with “ifs” and has recently failed to offer diversification benefits against equities, a correlation regime that continues to warrant a cash allocation in portfolios. While there will be incessant chatter about the flattening of the yield curve, implying an underperforming front-end and inviting talk of a recession, it is duration risk that matters most for investors. Front-end yields that optically underperform today do not necessarily translate into underperforming returns tomorrow: in fact, 1-to-3-year bonds have a forward return profile that crushes that of longer duration bonds (see Figure 13). Figure 13: Today, 1- to 3-year bonds have a more reliable income profile than 10-year bonds Source: Bloomberg, data as of March 25, 2022 Hence, investing in today’s markets feels a bit like being a security guard – there is a lot of watching of unprecedented environmental shocks, some of which occur after a long period of waiting for new information. But when periodic disturbances in markets do occur, action becomes necessary. Just as a security guard gets paid to wait, watch and then act, when necessary, today we like owning high-quality, short-duration assets that allow us to capture above-average yields, after the worst drawdowns in decades, while “watching and waiting to act,” with the knowledge that a few more months of data could bring a lot more clarity on which “ifs” transpire into which “thens.” '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Heightened geopolitical and inflationary pressures this year have put a spotlight on commodities, with investors using the asset class for a dual purpose: a potential hedge against inflation and adding diversification to a broader portfolio in a rising rate environment. As a result, we’ve seen an increase in prices and volatility across the commodity asset class as a whole. Commodities and inflationary forces Commodities, as represented by the S&P GSCI — a benchmark of 24 commodities in agriculture, energy and metals — is one of the top-performing asset classes year to date, up 34.52% through March 22nd, outpacing all other asset classes1. Structural drivers - such as strong demand from economies reopening from COVID-19 restrictions, localization of supply chains, and historical under-investment in commodity production — mean that the supply and demand mismatch could persist. Meanwhile, heightened geopolitical risk may be supportive of continued commodity strength. The current disruption in energy and commodity supplies could impact the inflation outlook significantly. 40% of Europe’s natural gas is sourced from Russia; the country is also responsible for 43% of global palladium, while Russia and Ukraine combined account for nearly 30% of global wheat exports.2 We see specific themes in commodities that could benefit from the transition to a low carbon economy. For example, we see persistent demand due to the vital role commodities play in renewable technologies, specifically metals such as copper, nickel, and aluminum. Copper, in particular, will be key to the low carbon transition. The metal is highly conductive and malleable. On average, a battery electric vehicle uses 183 lbs. of copper versus only 18-49 lbs. required by an average internal combustion vehicle.3 We believe exposure to commodities could help hedge against inflation. Notably, commodities like crude oil and natural gas are components within the energy portion of the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation. Not only does energy make up 7.4% of this inflation gauge, but it also impacts the costs many businesses bear in producing goods and services in the economy. 2022 commodities performance vs. S&P 500 & Bloomberg U.S. bond aggregate index Source: Bloomberg, as of March 22, 2022.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. Commodities as portfolio diversifiers On average, since 1997, commodities have historically outperformed the S&P 500 in the first 12 months after the beginning of a rate hiking cycle.5 They have exhibited relatively low correlation to equities and bonds over time, adding diversification to multi-asset portfolios6. Moreover, commodity sectors typically have a low correlation to each other. For instance, precious metals and livestock are two commodities sectors that have been negatively correlated in the last 10 years7. Therefore, broad commodity exposures could provide a source of diversification against equity and bond volatility within a rising environment. We are seeing sentiment towards gold strengthening as geopolitical uncertainty continues. Gold’s low-to-negative correlation to equities has been sought as equity volatility has increased in recent weeks.8 We believe the precious metal could benefit in the case of a negative growth shock — an economic shock that decreases potential GDP caused by the rising commodity prices. A negative growth shock could slow central bank appetite for rate hikes, decreasing the opportunity cost of holding gold in portfolios. ETFs for access to commodity indexes Investors are increasingly using commodities in their portfolios for diversification of returns and to help mitigate other risks in their portfolios, like inflation. Demand for broad, diversified commodities ETFs that give investors access to commodity exposures across the energy, metals, agriculture, and livestock sectors has continued to increase in 2022, bringing in $6 billion YTD after $8.4 billion in 20219. Gold focused ETFs also saw more than $9 billion of inflows as investors seek portfolio resilience. 2022 cumulative commodities flow Source: BlackRock, Bloomberg, as of March 22, 2022.

       "  'abstract': 'In this Real Assets viewpoint, explore key takeaways for investors from the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act, including where private capital can come in to complement public spending.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Key themes for investors The Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (IIJA), passed on November 2021, should result in greater infrastructure investment from private capital in the United States. The Act totals USD $1 tr over the next decade, including USD $550 bn of new spending on top of USD $450 bn that renews existing transportation funding. The funds will be distributed through grants and loans from federal agencies including the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy, as well as in the form of tax credits and other financial incentives. Key takeaways include some of the following: Net positive for investors: A primary goal of the Act was to leverage the effect of Federal programs with private capital, according to Sen. Rob Portman. The Act provides funding for projects that can drive economic growth as well as prepare the U.S. economy for the transition to net-zero, but with the aim of tapping both private equity and private debt. In addition, the legislation made it easier to greenlight projects, thus accelerating the permitting process. Public investment where it is needed: Many of the programs listed in the Act cover assets that are hard for private investors to underwrite due to a combination of high risk and low return. While transportation was the headline, there will be more money flowing to the Department of Energy (DOE). This investment provides important groundwork that can enable future private investment. Potential for new equity investments: The Act unlocks surface transportation (e.g. rail, road, etc.) for new concessions that allow private investors to come in as operators. It also encourages the use of public-private partnerships (PPP), which could lead to even more assets coming to market. 3D’s: The Act aligns with our investment themes: Decarbonization, Digitalization, & Decentralization. Components of new spending from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (category, $ billion USD spending) Source: Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act. August, 2021. Much needed funding for critical projects that encourage growth We believe many of the projects included in the Act should lead to stronger economic growth and open the door for greater private investment in certain infrastructure sectors in the future. These range from cyber-security measures, to electric grid modernization and the development and deployment of new technology such as carbon capture and hydrogen. Private capital currently invests in these on the fringes, but we believe greater public funding and development will make these sectors more investable in the future. Carbon capture, for example, could be a massive opportunity for infrastructure investors but the technology needs improvement to be economical. As the economy moves to net-zero, demands from customers and regulators will force businesses to greatly reduce their emissions. For many industries, carbon capture could be one of the best ways of accomplishing this. Hydrogen fuel is another example of an infrastructure technology that could be in high demand in the future, with the ultimate goal of having hydrogen hubs around the country. Utilities are quickly moving generation to renewable sources, but the two most prominent types of clean energy, solar and wind, are intermittent and peak generation does not always match peak demand. Natural gas ‘peaker’ generators, which utilities use during peak demand times, are one way to fill in the gap, and grid-level batteries can help. However, utilities believe that hydrogen could be the key to mass deployment of renewable energy on the grid scale, but costs need to improve.1 Private companies are investing in hydrogen as a fuel, but government support can hasten the move from the fringe to a more serious component of the US energy stack. Carbon sequestration is essential in the road to net zero by 2050 Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research; as of June 23, 2021. The renewable energy sector did not get as much direct assistance as originally expected, but the sector should benefit from supporting infrastructure. Renewable tax credits, which were included in the first version of the plan released in April were ultimately removed. However, the Act does include plans to increase grid resilience, reduce red tape on approval of transmission and provide necessary infrastructure around storage, including end-of-life recycling of grid-level batteries. Funding for ports should alleviate some supply-chain bottlenecks that is contributing to higher inflation today. The Act also puts aside $7.5bn for electric vehicle charging through grant programs and funding through the States which has been distributed. The focus on EV charging networks in the Act has resulted in more interest by municipalities, utilities and EV charging companies. Real estate should see ancillary benefits While real estate is not explicitly included in the plan, the sector inherently needs strong infrastructure to be useful for tenants. Improvements to roads and bridges are generally positive for all types of real estate. New public and, potentially, private capital supporting intermodal facilities should reduce friction for logistics tenants such as retailers and 3PL companies. Urban apartments and offices should benefit from improved public transit and congestion relief measures. Investment in broadband infrastructure would also help the growth of more tertiary metro areas as this may have previously been a barrier for population inflows. Further, programs around drought response included in the Infra Act will likely be necessary and especially supportive of real estate in the western region. Programs related to flood mitigation and FEMA response should support eastern and southern parts of the United States. The Infra Act could lead to more assets The Act should expand the availability of debt assets by broadening what qualifies as tax-exempt collateral and increasing existing caps. Qualifying broadband and carbon capture facilities are now eligible for tax-exempt status. This should bring more bonds to market backed by these types of assets. Additionally, the Act increases the national cap for tax-exempt highway bonds from USD $15 bn to USD $30 bn. Currently, USD $14.9 bn of the cap is used, according to the Bond Dealers of America, so further expansion will unlock a crucial funding source for state and local governments on their infrastructure. This spending may cause ancillary projects to be funded, which could need additional taxable bonds, although it is likely too early to speculate the potential supply. U.S. Infrastructure debt issuance in 2015 vs. 2021 Source: Inframation, infrastructure debt issuance in 2015 and 2021 The Infra Act creates a path for new equity opportunities. Within the law there is an entire section dedicated to new asset concessions for ‘surface transportation,’ which would give private investors the right to own and operate these assets. Surface transport includes highways, rail and intermodal facilities. It does prevent concession holders from taxing or tolling taxpayers earning less than USD $400k, so investors will likely focus on assets geared more towards businesses, such as intermodal terminals rather than toll roads. Language regarding public-private partnerships (PPP) is also sprinkled throughout the rest of the Infra Act, covering other types of infrastructure. In general, this will contribute to more public-private partnerships in the near term, but it may also be a harbinger of greater use of PPPs in the future within the US. Public-private partnerships with the Federal government have been especially difficult to implement due to red tape, and the law has provisions to lessen this hurdle. There are also many new loan and grant programs available for private investors. For example, the Act authorizes the Department of Energy to extend grants to transmission and generation owners and operators for improving resiliency. Another provides matching funds to implement ‘smart grid’ features. One sign of the potential growth of PPPs is that the Act requires value-for-money analysis on certain highway and railroad projects totaling over USD $750mm. This would require the project sponsor to price out a PPP option before moving ahead with only public funding. While this does not directly increase PPP usage, it opens the door for more growth over the next few years. Download full report '},\n",

       "  'content': ' The U.S. Federal Reserve’s (“Fed”) pivot away from the view that inflation is “transitory” signaled the beginning of the end for the ultra-low rate environment we have come to think of as normal. Financial markets reacted to this new information by aggressively repricing shorter-term interest rates to start the year. The exit from these policies now appear well priced-in for the U.S. as yield curves have flattened to levels typically associated with the end of a tightening cycle. Investors are now debating the terminal rate and what happens if inflation does not fall as much as consensus and the Fed expects. It looks almost certain that the Fed must end the era of quantitative easing (“QE”). Was QE a success? We must wait for quantitative tightening (“QT”) to see. The ultimate judge of more than a decade long experiment in unconventional policies lies in how the Fed can balance its conflicting objectives of maximum employment and stable prices without fully knowing how financial conditions will respond. Past inflationary cycles rarely end well for financial markets. The Russian invasion induced spike in commodity prices holds the potential to further exacerbate what might already be in train: a wage-price spiral. The risks surrounding this scenario have clearly increased and a more cautious outlook for this downside possibility is increasingly warranted. A stagflationary shock The economic and financial impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine represents a stagflationary shock for the global economy. The prices of commodities, including fuel, food and metals are all surging. Stagflation, an economic environment of stagnant growth and rising inflation, was once a long-tail risk, but now appears to be a real possibility. Figure 1 highlights crude oil and European natural gas prices have spiked to multi-year highs in a matter of days. As the Russian-Ukraine conflict continues, higher energy and commodity prices may feed through to broader increases in inflation and—combined with negative sentiment and confidence—a decline in global growth. So far, estimates for those impacts remain modest but hinge critically on the severity of the energy price spike, its duration, and the potential secondary effects. Figure 1: Russian invasion is creating shocks in energy marketsBrent crude oil and European natural gas futures prices Source: Bloomberg, as of 3/8/22. Markets typically price geopolitical risks quickly. However, with no clear near-term off-ramp for the conflict, we may be at the beginning of a more permanent reordering of Russia’s role in the global economy and more uncertainty as the West counteracts these rising tensions. Such ramifications are still being assessed in financial markets particularly on the outlook for the policy response. For Europe, with a more direct hit to both inflation and growth, dramatic shifts in security and energy policy suggest an accommodative fiscal policy response while the European Central Bank (“ECB”) outlook has become more balanced between the inflationary (tighter) and growth (loosening) impacts. For the U.S., higher commodity prices may flow into a longer period of elevated inflation, further bringing into question the forecast for its rapid decline in the second half of 2022. That will keep pressure on the Fed to normalize its currently highly accommodative stance. Flight-to-quality assets, a popular safe haven during periods of rising geopolitical tensions, may be a less sure outcome given the backdrop of tightening monetary policy. Expect more shockwavesThe unprecedented level of sanctions imposed on Russia is tantamount to completely removing the country from the global economy. Government officials and Russian-owned companies have been targeted. Its banking sector has been removed from the SWIFT messaging system—essentially disconnecting it from the financial system. Its capital markets have been cut out of global indices. Foreign private companies have stopped selling products and services in Russia. Even yachts have been seized. The latest move by the U.S. to ban its imports of Russian oil sent oil prices even higher. Extending this ban into Europe particularly in the short run and for Russian gas may not initially be possible, given the current dependency of Europe on Russian gas. However, the realization of the vulnerability has sent European energy and security policy on a new course with significant longer-term consequences. The magnitude of the energy price shock and its length will be key to the economic consequences. Failing to see an easy off-ramp for the crisis, the disruptions to energy markets may prove longer than initially anticipated, raising the uncertainty in the fight to rein in inflation and likely extending its duration. The vaccination for inflation? Vaccines gave us great hope that they could ease the scourge of the health pandemic. Analogously, the market expects the central bank “vaccination” for inflation will do the same. Both the Fed and most economic forecasters expect inflation to steadily return to the pre-COVID levels of around 2%. For central banks, vaccinating against inflation means moving away from the pandemic-era policy prescription of massive liquidity support and persistent negative and zero policy rates. But like the unpredictable peaks and valleys of the virus’s case count curve, markets may face the realization that these inflation vaccines may not be entirely effective against the “variants” of inflation. If so, markets may need to learn to live with more “endemic” inflation rather than a swift to return to “normal” that markets have experienced for the past decade. Retiring “transitory”The start of 2022 has not been kind to the old “transitory” view of inflation. Alongside “still dancing” and “subprime is too small to matter”, Fed Chair Jerome Powell retired “transitory” to the ash heap of historic market quip fails. Now, he has pivoted the Fed to acknowledging a more balanced view of inflation and a need to shift policy to a much less accommodative stance. Incoming data has made this reaction appear even further behind the curve, with continuously elevated readings signaling pressures beyond the supply chain bottlenecks associated with COVID disruptions. This inflation situation is not just a U.S. dilemma. European inflation data has started to break higher, and the ECB seems ready to break its policy commitment to hold rates constant throughout 2022. As a result, global rate expectations have moved significantly higher since the start of the year (Figure 2). Figure 2: Market rapidly shifted to anticipate significant hikes in U.S. and U.K.Global government bond rate expectations by end of 2022 Source: Refinitiv Datastream and BlackRock Investment Institute, as of 3/4/22. Lines calculated by using 100 minus the futures Dec 2022 and Dec 2021 futures prices on 3m Euribor, 3m Sterling, 3m Eurodollar, and 3m euroyen contracts. These market moves stand in contrast to the still benign inflation view held by both central banks and most economic forecasters. Though market expectations stand above official central bank forecasts, both parties anticipate a reduction in inflation back towards long-run goals of 2%. Despite retiring the \"transitory\" label, Fed policy forecasts reflected a transitory view of inflation. However, as inflation continues to be high and with recent energy price shocks, policymakers have clearly highlighted that the risks to inflation are on the upside to these forecasts. The key is whether inflation can actually decline even with above average longer-run real GDP growth, below longer-run unemployment levels, and with negative real policy rates. If not, absent changes in the first two, the Fed will need to set real policy rates higher than zero to bring inflation down or hope the supply side improvements underlying the \"transitory\" view on inflation can alone account for a return to pre-COVID inflation levels. Risks assuming inflation is benignTo use our virus metaphor, one of the key signposts of inflation moving from a spreading “pandemic” to more of a constant “endemic” is firm and worker pricing power. Both companies and workers have discovered they have pricing power (Figure 3). Historically high levels of “quits rate” indicate workers are exercising pricing power through elevated job switching. Similarly, companies report for the first time a strong ability to pass on price increases. Add to that now a more prolonged inflationary environment from the commodity spike, and the risks grow that transitory inflationary becomes entrenched. Figure 3: Company pricing power and worker pricing power breaks out upwardsCompany pricing power and cost of workers Source: Evercore ISI Company Surveys, Bloomberg, BLS, as of 12/31/21. This combination might have already kicked off a wage-price spiral—where rising wages lead firms to pass on price increases and rising prices embolden workers to demand higher wages. The risk is a continuous cycle of inflationary pressures that is endemic and not necessarily benign. Both the benign and endemic inflation scenarios have merit. Looking at Figure 4, the expectations for the path of inflation (yellow line), will rely on the broad strength of its underlying components (red line) and whether the forecasted declines start to show up in late spring and early summer. Policymakers will need to shift their current strategy if their assumptions do not play out. Figure 4: The rise and (forecasted) fall of inflationU.S. Trimmed Mean PCE and Core PCE inflation rates Source: Bloomberg, as of 1/31/22. Gray area is projected through June 2023. Determining the dosageThe surprisingly strong inflation data and its belated recognition by global central banks still only shows up in markets as an expectation for a faster move towards normalization—not a materially higher level of rates. Where normalization ends up remains relatively unchanged. Market expectations in the U.S. now price in a 25 bp hike at each meeting beginning in March. In Europe, the market initially priced in 50 bps worth of hikes by the end of the year before unwinding those expectations in face of the Russian invasion. Figure 5 highlights in the U.S., that measured in 2 years forward, the difference between the yield on 2-year and 10-year maturity bonds is essentially zero. This is one example of how yield curves have already flattened to a level typically associated with a level expected at the end of the tightening cycle. Figure 5: Yield curve prices in a full tightening cycle before the first tightening has even startedFed Funds Rate and steepness of yield curve (2s10s) Source: Bloomberg, as of 3/4/22. At the end of 2021, the Fed\\'s terminal rate forecasts had projected long-term policy rates around 2.5%. Coupled with the median longer-run inflation forecast of 2.5% (on CPI equivalent basis) implies a terminal zero real Fed Funds rate. All those estimates are likely to change in future Statement of Economic Projection releases and the bias is towards higher inflation forecasts and a higher path of policy rates along the way. Whether the Fed projects that the terminal rate returns to pre-COVID levels will be a key determinant of longer maturity yields performance. However, looking back through historical tightening cycles one lesson becomes clear: Fed policy rates typically end up eventually at a level above inflation in order to bring that inflation back down. More persistent inflation in the longer-run may imply a need for either a higher terminal rate or a higher rate along the way to terminal that actually tightens policy in order to bring inflation back down to that 2% longer-run forecast. Was QE a success? That depends on QT 2022 may mark the end of the historic global central bank experiment we have come to call quantitative easing (“QE”). Undoubtedly, QE saved the world’s economies from certain disaster in 2008 and 2020, but knowing if it was a success will depend on the exit strategy: quantitative tightening (“QT”). Inflation and geopolitics make QT much more difficult for central banks. So far, the forecast looks good, but a more cautious outlook may be warranted when considering the sheer size and reach of QE programs. Markets have become accustomed to over a decade of massive central bank balance sheet expansions supporting an asset inflation program geared around principles of the “portfolio rebalance” channel. Think of portfolio rebalance as the result of central bank policies that influence investors to shift their investments away from safe-haven assets towards assets with higher expected returns. The effect of portfolio rebalance can be seen in capital markets and in real assets like housing. Recall that the Fed took a similar path to combat the Global Financial Crisis (“GFC”). Accommodative policies helped to stabilize and then ease financial conditions. The appeal of safe-haven assets declined, and the attractiveness of risky assets grew. This asset reflation helped restore the confidence needed to support a consumption-based economy. During COVID, portfolio rebalance was even more immediate and effective as it was coupled by enormous fiscal policy support including direct transfers. That helped to support a rapid recovery in wealth in assets and maintained consumer consumption power as seen in Figure 6 with the surge in savings rates and subsequent decline once the spending kicked in as the worst COVID fears were averted. During COVID, portfolio rebalance was even more immediate and effective as it was coupled by enormous fiscal policy support including direct transfers. That helped to support a rapid recovery in wealth in assets and maintained consumer consumption power. Figure 6 demonstrates the surge in savings rates and subsequent decline once consumer spending restarted as the worst COVID fears were averted. Figure 6: QE helped the recovery in wealth after GFC and COVID. What happens when it’s reversed?U.S. household personal savings and net worth Source: Bloomberg, as of 12/31/21. The (de facto) third policy objectiveThe problem with the QE-era policy of relying on portfolio rebalance is that it moves financial conditions into a de facto third policy objective and constraint. Because the policy transmission function relies on financial conditions (i.e. stable interest rates and rising stock markets), those aspects become additional constraints to traditional policy objectives (inflation and employment). Policymakers can’t raise rates suddenly and dramatically to fight off inflation because it could cause a severe decline in valuations of risky assets like stocks. Investors understand this, and increasingly factor policy support into their investment decisions. The results have been mutually beneficial as the rise in measured wealth in the U.S. is beyond any historical comparisons. Growth in the U.S. today relies on consumption, and wealth effect fueled confidence can drive up or down that confidence. Using the portfolio rebalance channel post GFC in 2008 both recognized and codified this relationship. But in doing so, the Fed made normalizing highly accommodative policy through balance sheet reductions more difficult. The 2013 Taper Tantrum proved market expectations correct that when faced with too rapid of a tightening in financial conditions, the Fed would pull back on policy normalization. Normalizing now becomes much more challenging for the Fed due to inflation. In 2013, inflation was still low, limiting any perceived cost from slowing normalization. Today, the Fed needs to thread the needle even more carefully between tightening enough to look credible on fighting inflation without pushing financial markets into a panic, harming confidence, and risking a recession. Portfolio construction implications We see two scenarios where inflation significantly impacts asset allocation decisions. The first is a return to the “secular stagnation” of the 2010s when inflation and growth were consistent but low. The second scenario is one where we must learn to live with higher levels of uncertainty around both inflation and growth. A return to secular stagnationThe market expects inflation and growth to return to the pre-COVID level of 2% by 2024. This low growth, low inflation environment led primarily to persistent zero and negative real interest rate policies. Flat term premia for inflation risk in an environment of low and stable inflation imply similarly low real rates of interest on longer-maturity bonds. Low real yields imply low expected real returns from bonds. And low safe asset returns lead to the outward shift in risk taking in pursuit of higher returns—the portfolio rebalance effect. Analog to this, the equity market saw the persistent outperformance of growth stocks over value stocks in an era decidedly lacking in (nominal) growth opportunities. We are well acquainted with this market environment. Living with inflation and growth uncertaintyBut what about the alternative scenario where inflation fails to fall back to pre-COVID levels? For the Fed to just keep policy close to neutral, higher inflation implies higher terminal rates. A 3% inflation rate implies a policy rate of 3.25-3.50%—a full 100 bps higher than currently priced—just to get back to neutral. You might need to actually get policy tight to achieve stable inflation. That requires moving policy rates above the level of inflation. But even a small real positive interest rate at the short end might cascade across financial markets in ways that tighten financial conditions aggressively. Either that forces the Fed’s hand to ease back on tightening or makes the smaller amount of tightening that much more effective as it transmits through financial conditions. The portfolio rebalance effect could now go in the opposite direction with risk assets becoming less appealing and the perceived loss of wealth hurting confidence and spending. How much sensitivity to financial conditions has over a decade of unconventional QE policy sown? No one can be certain, but the impact of portfolio risk shifting in response to easing financial conditions has been slow and methodical over the decade. Behavioral finance highlights the reverse is unlikely to be similar. Loss aversion means a more rapid rebalance—which partially explains the “tantrum” like behavior we often see in financial markets. Markets grind upwards and gap downwards. Such risks are now much more likely given the Fed no longer has all three of its main policy objectives aligned. Taking the fight to inflation means risking both full employment and financial stability. Managing the side effects of an inflation vaccinationInvesting in this shifting environment requires recognizing the new risks. Investors should evaluate allocations relative to forecasted future risks and rely less on past results as a guide. For stock and bond allocations, it is imperative to question the health of historical negative correlations given the toll that inflation and rising rates can have on bond returns. Many investors are entering an environment they have little to zero experience navigating. That leads to the search for solutions between alternative asset classes and alternative investment strategies. In asset classes, the market has now moved to fully price in meeting-by-meeting hikes in 2022 (Figure 7), improving the risk reward to the short end of the yield curve. Longer-maturity assets retain their flight to quality benefits but may become more vulnerable as they approach the terminal rate if inflation fails to fall as much as forecast. Higher credit risk assets, such as high yield and emerging market debt, look less appealing given the higher yields available in risk-free rates. However, widening in credit spreads is helping by providing some more risk premia to a recessionary or stagflationary outlook. For the near-term, we find safer assets in Investment Grade and MBS more attractive given their higher exposure to risk-free rates and less credit spread exposure. Figure 7: Meeting-by-meeting hikes expectedInterest rate at YE 2022 and implied number of hikes Source: Bloomberg, as of 3/4/22. The Russian invasion coming on top of the already difficult inflationary outlook further raises the uncertainty for both risk-free and risky assets. In such an environment, it may be prudent to augment portfolio asset allocations, which are dominated by “beta” risk, with “alpha” return sources. New sources of diversification and return may be needed as inflation undermines the traditional diversifying properties of bonds. Download commentary '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'What is the path for fiscal and monetary policy in 2022? Rick Rieder discusses his outlook and explains why demand for fixed income will continue to exceed expectations, holding yields in check even amid historically high inflation.',\n",
       "  'content': ' A Q&A with Rick Rieder Q: What is your outlook for 2022 for your asset class? In our view, demand for fixed income will continue to exceed expectations, generally holding yields in check at higher levels than we have been used to over the past couple of years amid historically high inflation, but when the dust settles, we’ll see real rates that are still at historically low levels. That’s partly because corporate pension funds are sitting on the highest average funding status in almost two decades, prompting a reallocation out of risky assets and into risk-free securities, like long duration Treasury bonds. At the same time, nominal growth is also the highest it has been in decades, driven by an immense stock of liquidity, meaning risky spreads can stay well contained for longer since corporate default fears can be kept at bay due to rising earnings. We think the Bloomberg-Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, a hybrid of both risk-free and risky assets, should rightfully back up in 2022, in sympathy with strong growth, which we’ve already started to see early this year. So, it’s hard to see a promising return coming from this index in 2022. Still, with both risk-free yields and risky spreads staying relatively contained, due to other supporting factors, it’s also hard to see investors suffering a crippling loss in this broad index. So, we’re still optimistic about an astute investor’s ability to generate a positive return in fixed income, despite the Aggregate index likely not straying too far from flat, but it’s going to require a well-calibrated, and active, approach and the ability to engage market segments beyond those included in the index. Q: How will fiscal policy and focused spending in the U.S. (can acknowledge other countries as well) impact markets and drive growth, and what are some of the knock-on effects (i.e., inflation, tightening labor markets, debt levels, etc.)? As my colleague Bob Miller has recently argued, new fiscal policy support may no longer be likely, but in our view the probability of fiscal tightening in the next three years is near zero. That places the burden of refining policy on the Federal Reserve, and policy normalization in 2022 will be in the context of a second consecutive year of impressive nominal GDP growth (see graph below), making the composition of that growth, namely the quantities and prices components, of critical importance for investors. Expectations for nominal growth in 2022 are historically high Bloomberg, data as of December 8, 2021. The supply of labor will determine the evolution of the labor market, rather than demand. Conservatively, assuming 200k-400k monthly nonfarm payroll gains over the course of 2022, wage growth that is in-line with that of the last 12 months, and no change in hours worked, we would witness an aggregate income gain for the labor force of about 7% over the course of 2022. And remarkably, in that event aggregate income would have grown by more than 14% since the pandemic began in February 2020. Yet this also means that about three million people will need to be added to the labor force – an effective “passing of the income baton” from fiscal stimulus to wages, a process that is well underway. While the numbers are volatile, non-seasonally adjusted payroll data suggests that more than a half million employees are being added to payrolls each month in 2021, which would likely be even stronger absent supply constraints. While we are seeing early signs of moderation on supply-chain stresses, economic velocity is now gaining support from increased commercial and industrial lending, and consumer lending, which can keep upward pressure on prices for several more months. Our projection is for Core PCE inflation to ultimately migrate back to the 2.5% to 3.5% range by year-end, as commodity prices plateau near these elevated levels and as many of the logistical bottlenecks loosen up. However, we are preparing for more headline-grabbing inflation data points that could send the media, and some traders, into a tailspin. Moreover, there’s also clearly some inflation-stickiness from persistently higher wages and a corporate sector that is in the luxurious position of being able to raise prices almost at will. Q: How do you expect fiscal spend and monetary policy forecasts to impact your remit, both from a tactical & a long term perspective? Tactically, where is the market mispricing risk? Very important to 2022’s market path is how the Fed responds in the months ahead, especially in the face of these potentially uncomfortable inflation readings. The Fed’s policy response to the pandemic was heroic, and their ongoing accommodation has been instrumental in enabling the real economy to withstand waves of new Covid variants. But with real-economy confidence now sufficiently restored, the Fed needs to migrate monetary policy back toward neutral; before pausing to determine if more restrictive monetary policy is required. In our view, one of the market’s riskiest blind spots for this year will be navigating portfolio allocation changes as the Fed evolves its policy stance. Historically speaking, in terms of monetary policy, “tightening,” or “over-tightening,” was about corralling excessive credit growth (demand that was fueled by credit). However, today’s conditions are precisely the opposite: U.S. consumers have been paying down credit for a decade. There has been very little credit growth, much less excessive growth, largely due to an influx of cash via pandemic stimulus measures (indeed, there is about $2.5 trillion of excess savings on consumer balance sheets right now). From our perspective, the Fed’s policy toolkit should consist of rate hikes as well as some reduction in the central bank’s balance sheet. On rates, targeting the pre-Covid level of 1.50% as an initial destination seems prudent, with the mantra of ‘data dependence’ setting a high hurdle to adjust to either more accommodative, or restrictive, levels. We subscribe the economic theories that policy “works with long and variable lags,” and that inflation itself tends to be a lagging indicator. With that perspective, we support the Fed setting a course to an achievable resting place as a good first step on this policy journey. The velocity of money is set to bounce from historic, pandemic-induced lows The modern history of US M2 Velocity Bloomberg, data as of September 30, 2021. Stepping back from the policy path, we think the real economy has some tangible momentum behind it. Indeed, we think M2 velocity is set to bounce sharply from its lowest level in history (see graph above), buoyed by still strong sentiment in both the real and financial economies. In fact, the equation of exchange suggests that a small mean-reversion in velocity, in light of the recent large increase in the monetary base, can create gaudy nominal growth outcomes over time. The return of velocity may have already begun as October was the first post-Covid month without any new excess savings (but cumulative savings remain around $2.5 trillion), and after an anemic 18 months for consumer and real estate loan growth, a $1.6 trillion gap in bank lending has developed. Therefore, there is ample space for credit creation to pick up the growth baton once QE ends in 2022, in our view. In short, the Fed operates on top of the most dynamic, and self-correcting, economy in the history of the world. Cushioning the system is critical when a major shock occurs (e.g., a historic and unpredictable global pandemic), but otherwise, the Fed’s stated destination of price, market and economic stability is probably best reached by operating with policy stability, while allowing the vibrant, innovative and flexible U.S. economy to recalibrate organically. Q3: Which asset classes and sectors are best positioned to benefit from the investment in new technology and energy infrastructures underpinning the net-zero transition? While global growth will be robust, parts of the tech sector are set to grow exponentially over the next decade. Virtual reality, augmented reality, and the metaverse are going to be concepts that we hear more and more about, and in which early investors will likely be rewarded. Technology continues to permeate the healthcare industry too: medical investment is set to soar in a post-Covid world. Last but not least, as you asked about energy infrastructure in the context of the net-zero transition, this is going to be an important secular investment theme and we’re undoubtedly going to continue to get weather events to reinforce that theme. In our view, staying in front of these structural forces is imperative, but especially in the equity segment of the capital structure Ever evolving climate-focused policy initiatives will continue to play a very large role in dictating where investment dollars are allocated, with a significant feedback to how and where prices are set, and profits are earned. Q: What are your top positioning ideas heading into 2022? Given our view that the Aggregate index is likely to end the year in moderately negative territory, we think it’s important to be able to engage market segments beyond those included in the index, including those below investment grade. More specifically, some of the yields available in U.S. and European credit sectors are not terribly far from being able to reach that 3% to 5% target, especially if one is willing to dip into high yield segments. Further, emerging markets yields are even higher, but emerging markets positions need to be sized appropriately, given their volatility. And while Emerging Markets were best avoided last year (excluding China), the proactive increases in policy rates from EM central banks to fend off inflation have now created an attractive opportunity set of real rates to buy in 2022, albeit with patience and tactical entry points needed as noise from Fed tightening can cloud the vision here. And as markets have evolved over the past month, we now see more decent value in the short-to-belly segment of the U.S. Treasury market, where tightened policy is fairly priced, and yields offer some protection against downside for the first time since the onset of Covid. Of course, we must remain aware of the potential for an overly aggressive Fed to overshoot, which could press these yields still moderately higher. Additionally, the very back-end of the Treasury curve, while it can be a more volatile trading vehicle, nevertheless can provide a decent entry point today to defease liabilities for long-term managers. Bank loans can also perform well with a strong economy and modestly higher rates. And bespoke securitized assets in commercial real estate, consumer credit and CLOs should round out investors’ fixed income portfolios, with meaningful support from vibrant economic cash flows and an enormous pool of cash that needs attractive returns in a still low-yielding world. The liquidity injections of 2020-21 underpin a sticky high growth rate, or the “g” variable in the terminal value equation. As a result, organic growth in 2022 will be enough for equity markets to post a decent return for the fourth consecutive year, but as mentioned likely a lower return than the exceptional performance of the last few years. Still, too many market participants are solely focused on inflation, but if there’s a 1970s parallel that’s useful today, it’s how extreme policy actions can influence market returns for a long time (see graph below). In 1980, a high discount rate made the risk-free rate a superior investment for years afterward, and in 2022, the liquidity injections of the last two years will likely keep growth, and asset prices, high for several years hence.

       "  'content': ' Key themes: 1. Policy normalization and living with inflation Markets have started the new year on a jittery note, with worries centering on Fed rate increases and policy normalization. These moves are worth putting into context. Long-term rates remain at the low end of their historical ranges, with the real rate on the 10-year Treasury at roughly -0.75%. Second, although markets now expect rate increases to start sooner than they did a few months ago, the expected cumulative increase in rates over the next three years is essentially the same as it was before the Fed\\'s hawkish pivot. Such an increase would represent the most muted inflation response in decades. We see quantitative tightening (QT) – the shrinking of the Fed’s balance sheet - working mostly through the term premium, the extra compensation investors demand for the risk of holding government bonds. The 2018-19 experience suggests a small impact from QT alone. Yet in the context of rising inflation, QT could add to a broader narrative around the need for greater compensation from fixed income relative to risk assets. This new regime implies a more fundamental asset reallocation. The Fed might be contributing to this reallocation rather than causing it. The focus for monetary policy in 2022 is not on hitting the brakes but on taking the foot off the gas and returning to a more neutral policy stance. 2. Cutting through confusion There are no historical parallels to today’s confluence of events – the economic restart, the appearance of new virus strains, supply-driven inflation and the development of new central bank frameworks. As a result, the current environment is marked by confusion. Cutting through this confusion is key. To do so, it is essential to identify risks in the new regime. We see three main risks. The first risk is that a global resurgence in COVID-19 infections could delay the restart of economic activity. This problem could be particularly acute in China if its zero-COVID approach results in repeated shutdowns. The Omicron strain appears less severe than other variants in populations with high vaccination and immunity rates. Moreover, evidence from almost two years of the pandemic shows that successive waves of the virus have had less and less impact on GDP – a positive for the growth outlook. We expect new virus strains to delay, but not derail, the restart. The second risk is that central banks could revert to previous policy responses in the face of persistent inflation pressures. Finally, inflation expectations could diverge significantly from policy targets in the post-COVID confusion, forcing central banks to react aggressively. This development could lead to stagflation — high inflation becoming persistent amid stagnating activity. 3. Navigating net zero Climate change and the race for the world to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 also play into the general confusion. There is a popular notion that tackling climate change may lead to higher economic costs and inflation. We don’t agree. Yes, the outlook would be better if climate change didn’t exist. But that’s not an option; climate change is real. A smooth net-zero transition, therefore, has to imply higher growth and lower inflation than any alternative, in our view. No climate action or a disorderly transition suggests lower growth and higher inflation. The energy crunch in late 2021 revealed that the transition so far has been lopsided: Reduced investment in fossil fuels has not been offset by a boost to investment in alternative energy and its infrastructure. A smoother and more balanced transition will not only need clean energy but also new technologies to store and distribute it. In our view, demand for fixed income will continue to exceed expectations. One reason: Corporate pension funds, at their highest average funding status in almost two decades, are likely to reallocate out of risky assets and into risk-free securities. We expect strong demand to hold yields in check, albeit at higher levels than in recent years amid historically high inflation. When the dust settles, we expect real rates to remain historically low. Risk spreads also should stay contained as strong nominal growth keeps fear of corporate defaults at bay. We think yields in the Bloomberg-Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, a hybrid of risk-free and risky assets, should rise in 2022. But if both risk-free yields and risky spreads stay relatively contained, as we expect, this broad index looks unlikely to deal investors crippling losses. Moreover, we’re optimistic about astute active investors’ ability to generate a positive return in fixed income. U.S. fiscal spending and central bank policy outlook Although new fiscal policy support may no longer be likely, in our view the risk of fiscal tightening in the next three years is near zero. The policy burden will be on the Federal Reserve. The Fed is likely to normalize monetary policy in 2022 only in the event of a second consecutive year of impressive nominal GDP growth (see table below). For investors, how much of that growth comes from price increases versus real growth will be critical. In our view, one of the greatest challenges this year will be navigating changes to portfolio allocations as the Fed evolves its policy stance. Expectations for nominal growth in 2022 are historically high Source: Blooomberg, data as of December 8, 2021. Although new fiscal policy support may no longer be likely, in our view the risk of fiscal tightening in the next three years is near zero. The policy burden will be on the Federal Reserve. The Fed has begun to normalize monetary policy in the context of a second consecutive year of impressive nominal GDP growth (see table below). For investors, how much of that growth comes from price increases versus real growth will be critical. In our view, one of the greatest challenges this year will be navigating changes to portfolio allocations as the Fed evolves its policy stance. We think we have officially begun a two-stage process of gradual departure from emergency monetary policy conditions. The first stage being a return to a more neutral, normal monetary policy and then, secondly, a potentially more restrictive policy to address what has clearly been surprisingly high and sticky levels of inflation. First, in getting to neutral we think that over the next year and a half the Fed will bring policy rates to just below the level of potential growth (between 1.5% and 2% Fed Funds) and will allow for the run-off of the extremely large “excess-excess reserves” sitting in the banking system. It is clear at this point that the Fed has inflation firmly in its sights, despite the still maturing nature of this economic recovery, but it has also very much kept the door open to adjust policy if the economy slows from here. The velocity of money is set to bounce from historic, pandemic-induced lows The modern history of US M2 Velocity Source: Bloomberg, data as of September 30, 2021. The real economy has momentum. We think M2 velocity will bounce sharply from its lowest level in history (see graph above), buoyed by strong sentiment in both the real and financial economies, and we think credit creation could drive growth after QE ends in 2022. Accelerants of growth: technology and the net-zero economy Parts of the tech sector are set to grow exponentially over the next decade. Early investors in virtual reality, augmented reality, and similar areas are likely to be rewarded. Medical investment is set to soar, and energy infrastructure will be an important secular theme for the net-zero transition. Portfolio implications We think investors need to be able to engage market segments beyond those in the Aggregate index, including those below investment grade. We now see value in the short-to-belly segment of the U.S. Treasury market, where yields offer some downside protection for the first time since the onset of COVID. Bank loans also may perform well with a strong economy and modestly higher rates. Bespoke securitized assets in commercial real estate, consumer credit and CLOs should round out investors’ fixed income portfolios. The era in which policy floated all boats is ending. Sector selection will be key, as will deciphering dispersion within each sector. The paths of inflation and interest rates, megatrends such as digitization and decarbonization, and numerous sub-themes all look to have a profound effect on alternatives and private markets in 2022. Regional growth and inflation data are likely to result in diverging monetary policies: tightening in the U.S., the European Central Bank likely staying on hold, and the People’s Bank of China easing due to slower growth. Risk of policy error has risen, in our view, which may impact credit conditions across regions. Meanwhile, U.S. fiscal spending plans could have an outsized impact in sectors like infrastructure and healthcare, which are political priorities. That said, we are likely to see less cooperation across the political aisle as the U.S. approaches a contentious midterm election. Real assets This year is set for a broader, stronger upswing in real assets, marked by a fast rebound upon reopening and a slow rebuild to recover lost capacity. We see the cyclical rebound, technological changes and the response to climate change as three dominant drivers of the real assets outlook. At the same time, we expect the market rebound to play out differently in economies around the world, due to variations in reopening strategies, a longer-term push toward re-shored supply chains, differences across sectors, and investment shifts from other asset classes to achieve higher and more resilient yields. Infrastructure The recently passed Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act (the Act) should result in greater infrastructure investment from private capital in the U.S. We believe many of the projects included in the Act should lead to stronger economic growth and open the door for greater private investment in certain infrastructure sectors. These projects range from cyber security measures to electric grid modernization and carbon capture. The Act totals USD $1 tr over the next decade, including USD $550 bn of new spending on top of USD $450 bn that renews existing transportation funding. The funds will be distributed through grants and loans from federal agencies including the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy, tax credits and other financial incentives. The Act unlocks surface transportation for new concessions that allow private investors to come in as operators. It also encourages the use of public-private partnerships (PPP), which could lead to even more assets coming to market. Components of new spending from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (category, $ billion USD spending) Source: Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act. August, 2021. The Act also should lead to more private activity bond issuance collateralized by infrastructure assets. This process will be accomplished by allowing qualified broadband and carbon capture to become eligible for tax-exempt status, and by doubling the cap on highway tax-exempt bonds from USD $15 bn to USD $30 bn. New funding for projects elsewhere in the Act could lead to additional taxable supply. Additionally, new equity investments by private investors will create further need for infrastructure debt during the coming decade. U.S. Infrastructure debt issuance in 2015 vs. 2020 Source: Inframation, infrastructure debt issuance in U.S. in 2015 and 2020 The massive and long-running move from fossil fuels to renewables is broadening beyond wind and solar power generation, as more power segments — particularly blue and green hydrogen, carbon capture, electric vehicle charging and battery storage – take advantage of falling costs, rising scale economies and improving commercial viability. The ability to reduce the carbon footprint of cars, power plants and factories presents new commercial opportunities to achieve net zero, alongside the big and essential buildout in renewable power. For example, carbon capture could become a massive opportunity for infrastructure investors, but the technology needs improvement to be economical. Carbon sequestration is essential in the road to net zero by 2050 Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research; as of June 23, 2021. Hydrogen fuel is another example of an infrastructure technology that could be in high demand in the future with adequate funding from the Act. Utilities are quickly moving generation to renewable sources, but the two most prominent types of clean energy, solar and wind, are intermittent, and peak generation does not always match peak demand. Natural gas \"peaker\" generators, which utilities use during peak demand times, are one way to fill in the gap, and grid-level batteries can help, but both solutions have limitations. Utilities believe that hydrogen could be the key to mass deployment of renewable energy on the grid scale, but its efficiency needs to improve.1 Private companies are investing in hydrogen as a fuel, but government support can hasten the move from the fringe to a more serious component of the U.S. energy stack. 2021 was remarkable in many respects. Value rivaled growth for the first time in half a decade, earnings growth and positive earnings surprises were historically high, and inflation readings exceeded any seen by many present-day investors. What next? We see growth and value running neck and neck in 2022, offering opportunity for both investment styles. Earnings should remain strong as companies look to meet pent-up demand for products and services. Earnings surprises, on the other hand, are already moderating toward the long-run trend (see chart below). Conversely, inflation may continue to overdeliver. While inflation is a concern and a source of volatility, it also makes stocks the most compelling choice among the major asset classes. Individual companies will manage through a high-inflation environment in different ways, highlighting the importance of a stock-by-stock approach. 2022 earning outlook: Less surprising, more normalizing S&P 500 earning per share (EPS) surprise, 2003-2021 Source: BlackRock Fundamental Equities, with data from FactSet as of Nov. 10, 2021.

Inflation impediments Inflation is our top concern. Companies have been more than able to pass on rising costs to this point, but we’re watching inflation’s potential to squeeze profit margins, particularly if consumers become less willing to pay up for goods and services. Inflation’s impact on monetary policy is an even bigger consideration. The greatest threat to stocks’ risk-reward prospects is the possibility that nominal rates rise to the point where real interest rates are no longer negative. Despite these concerns, stocks are one of the best places to be in a world with rising inflation. Our review of data back to the 1920s finds that equities have performed well during inflationary environments when inflation wasn’t out of control (over 10%). Value stocks have performed particularly well in moderate inflation environments (5%-10%). Fiscal and monetary policy support Swift, significant and globally coordinated fiscal and monetary policy stimulus arrived early in the COVID-19 crisis and has continued throughout it, propping up economies and staving off financial crisis. Central banks are now making strategic moves away from emergency measures. In the U.S., the Fed has started to taper its monthly asset purchases, while contemplating interest rate hikes but not immediately enacting them. We acknowledge the strong risk that inflation may force the Fed to act sooner rather than later. Yet it is important to note that rates would be rising from a historically low base, and real rates are likely to remain negative. This backdrop would remain supportive for stocks. Cash comes in from the sidelines Both businesses and individuals held cash aside amid the height of the pandemic uncertainty. As confidence returned in 2021, companies deployed excess cash, with half of dividend payers in the Russell 1000 Index raising or initiating a dividend. We see even better prospects for capital returns through share buybacks and growing dividends in 2022. Household balance sheets are in good shape, unemployment is down, and wages are up. Excess cash has been finding its way into equity markets, with equity ETFs and mutual funds attracting more in 2021 than in the past 19 years combined, according to analysis from BofA Global Research and EPFR data. Although the bulk this trend may have occurred, we see room for more. The pandemic led to historic levels of fiscal stimulus being pumped into the economy. Efforts including unemployment benefits, business loans and stimulus checks helped strengthen balance sheets across the country and avoid the prolonged effects of a financial crisis. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have been building both within the U.S. and outside. Prices of commodities like oil and gasoline have climbed due to supply-chain issues and an ongoing clean-energy transition. Such changes have prompted investors to seek inflation protection in areas like commodities and real estate investment trusts (REITS). The most prominent impact on financial markets has been negative real rates in fixed-income investments. Institutional investors, trying to make up for those lost returns, have turned to alternative markets like private equity, private credit and real estate. Fiscal spend and inflation protection Our bird’s-eye view is that fiscal spending will continue to be good for growth but that repercussions tied to inflation will be with us for some time. To track the impact of the Omicron variant on shipping and other economic activity, we are monitoring indicators such as container shipping. Goods prices have been an important source of inflation over the course of the pandemic – a key difference from the previous decade. As Omicron cases peak, consumption could rotate away from goods and towards services. If this shift is sustained, there is room for goods demand to decline relative to services. U.S. Core Goods CPI vs. Core Services CPI: 2010-2020 Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics; as of January 2022. Commodities can provide inflation protection, with our research showing that energy markets have the strongest inflation-protection benefits, while industrial metals give moderate protection, and agriculture and livestock give very minimal protection. We’ve also found that real estate investment trusts, which are thought to provide an inflation hedge, don’t consistently provide protection during periods of rapid price increases. In the current market environment with accelerating inflation, investors have been sobered by the full valuations in equities and fixed income, and market volatility that has been creeping higher. Furthermore, investors are increasingly questioning the assumption that stock and bond markets are negatively correlated, weakening the diversifying properties of fixed income investments. Hence, there are more investors seeking out alternatives to tap into a broader series of returns with lower balance sheet volatility. The role of alternatives in 2022 Different institutions can have varying priorities, ranging from inflation hedging to liquidity requirements. However, these goals have often conflicted with the negative interest-rate environment in the public markets. That’s increased the need by institutions to deepen their commitments to alternative investments, such as private credit and real estate. Private credit and diversifying hedge-fund strategies can serve as replacements for fixed-income in diversified portfolios. These exposures hold the potential to deliver annual returns in the high single digits to low double digits, with benefits for a portfolio’s diversification. We believe investors should weigh concerns about illiquidity against the potential for poor performance in core fixed income. In some cases, private equity and real assets such as real estate and infrastructure can help reduce reliance on public investments. Within real assets, we’ve found that investors—depending on their needs and risk profile--can find steady cash-flow-generating assets, such as apartment buildings, or delve into special-situation and relative value investments, like distressed commercial properties. Real estate and infrastructure also present opportunities for investing with an ESG lens. For instance, some institutions have been investing in infrastructure opportunities like solar plants, wind farms and clean-energy facilities. In these volatile and inflationary times, what’s been key is to find brick-and-mortar assets to add diversification, while also aligning with the longer-term goals of institutions if they have broader aims in ESG.

       "  'content': ' Applying a long-term lens We enter 2022 with a lot to consider. The paths of inflation and interest rates, the profound effects of megatrends such as digitization and decarbonization and numerous sub-themes all demand our immediate attention. As private market investors we view this landscape with our own long-term lens. Our search is for idiosyncratic, resilient exposures within broad long-term trends. We see the world as: Within private markets, getting the trend right is only the first step. With investments that are typically hand-picked and actively managed, execution and underwriting are critical. The market regime is unusual but underwriting resilient risk-adjusted returns will always be at the heart of private market investing. Our key takeaways We believe that private markets risk premia are still attractive and can offer portfolio resilience. We expect megatrends to benefit this vintage of private markets investments, but see selection as increasingly important. The path to net zero is a major opportunity. Navigating the pathway will be an essential element of investment success. Vintage investing remains a powerful tool. Portfolio perspectives Portfolio construction is an increasingly important driver of returns. Below, we show how a private market portfolio can incorporate the themes presented in our 2022 Outlook. This is an illustrative exercise rather than an investment recommendation. The starting point is a market-weighted portfolio, where allocations are sized proportionally to the assets under management in the corresponding sectors of the Preqin universe. In the thematic portfolio, we increased our exposure to infrastructure and real estate to reflect the decarbonization and digitization themes and relative value we see in these sectors. The thematic portfolio retains exposure to technology and healthcare through its allocations to private equity and credit, while the increased weightings in infrastructure and real estate significantly reduce overall risk.

The material was prepared without regard to specific objectives, financial situation or needs of any investor. In our opinion, the year 2022 is set for a broader and stronger real asset market upswing. We think this cycle will be best understood by taking a 3D perspective. For real assets as a whole, we see the cyclical rebound, technological change and the response to climate change as three dominant drivers. At the same time, the market is driven by a decoupled rebound due to variations in reopening strategies and a longer-term push towards re-shored supply chains; a differentiated market upswing across sectors; and a competitive deployment stage, due to abundant capital moving into real assets, partly reflecting a shift from other asset classes for relatively higher and more resilient yields. For infrastructure markets, the 3Ds are decarbonization, digitalization and decentralization. The push to decarbonize the global economy requires a massive energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables, not just with the mainstays of solar and wind, but increasingly with carbon capture, battery storage and blue and green hydrogen. The digital world continues to transform our daily lives, with online work, shopping, schooling and entertainment markedly accelerated by the pandemic, as robotics and automation deliver genuine productivity gains. Moreover, infrastructure services are decentralizing on several fronts, as location becomes less important for virtual work and shopping, and as holdings diversify for resilience and operational efficiency. For real estate markets, the 3Ds of infrastructure are similarly applicable, while we see several additional drivers at work. In particular, the wide and sustained divergence in performance between the winners (sheds and beds) and losers (hotels and retail) are likely to be sustained for now, providing considerable scope for alpha from sector selection. At the same time, distressed and dislocated real estate segments are starting to show signs of deep value, although these opportunities need on-the-ground, off-market sourcing capabilities to unlock. Looking further ahead, long-run demographic drivers remain all- important, with local differences in population and ageing trends making compelling cases for childcare centers in Australia, multifamily housing in the U.S. and senior living in Japan. Three dimensions of change Uneven cyclical recoveries, tech disruption and climate risks are all impacting markets Source: BlackRock, as of December 2021. Following the re-opening rebound last year, we expect strong but decelerating growth in 2022, which remains a positive economic backdrop for credit. We expect that growth next year will differ meaningfully across regions, contributing to a wider range of outcomes. Credit markets remain a critical source of income for investors, and we believe both public and private credit should be a core holding in portfolios. The scale and complexity of global credit markets are growing rapidly, and supply chain issues, labor shortages, cost inflation and gradual tightening of financial conditions should drive higher dispersion across sectors and among issuers. Accelerating secular trends are impacting both issuers and investors in global credit markets. For issuers, capital is more widely available in both public and private forms, which has contributed to historically low default rates and the ongoing convergence of public and private markets as companies seek the capital best aligned to their particular needs. As businesses adapt to these opportunities, the greater availability and flexibility of capital may make credit cycles smaller, more frequent and sector-specific as conditions become increasingly dependent on sector dynamics. The higher yield and proportion of return from income coupled with lower interest-rate sensitivity keeps credit attractive relative to fixed income assets, in our view. Private debt is a growing source of finance Total debt outstanding excluding dry powder (US$m notional) Source: JP Morgan, Preqin Ltd. as of 27 October 2021. Private debt amounts exclude dry powder. U.S. HY/LL = JP Morgan U.S. High Yield and Leveraged Loan Indices. European HY/LL = JP Morgan European High Yield and Leveraged Loan Indices. Our outlook for 2022 is one of cautious optimism. Private equity as an asset class has demonstrated its resilience in the last two years. Valuations remain full, even for companies that have had to bounce back from the pandemic’s effects. Transactions continue to grow in size and are becoming increasingly global. We believe there is room for continued growth and we expect the current rapid pace of investment to continue in 2022, supported by low interest rates, open capital markets and an abundance of dry powder after two years of strong fundraising. The size of the private equity market has tripled in the last decade, from nearly US$2 trillion in 2010 to over US$6 trillion in November 2021, according to Preqin. The number of active private equity investors has tripled as well, as access is democratized and increasingly multi-dimensional. While many may worry we have reached a peak, we see little evidence for a slowdown in the short term. In fact, we see room for growth, as private equity evolves and enlarges its still comparatively small share of the overall equity markets through tools such as secondaries and more flexible structures. Secondaries have proven a practical tool for efficient portfolio management, as well as an effective tool for GPs or LPs seeking liquidity. The increased number of GP-led non-traditional secondaries in 2021 shows the desire for innovative structures, as GPs explore secondary capital as an avenue to achieve liquidity in specific companies. In effect, secondary capital allows GPs to own assets for up to 8-10 years versus a traditional hold period of four years. Both LPs and GPs continue to seek creative and scalable ways to unlock greater value and extend the longevity of strong companies in their portfolios. The growth of longer-term funds, fund extensions facilitated by the secondary market and continuation vehicles or annex funds into which GPs roll existing investments are all signs of an evolving and increasingly versatile market.

       "  'content': ' This piece was originally published in Fortune on 12/17/21. Americans are industrious people. When we were forced into quarantine last year, we quickly figured out how to carry on from our living rooms and our kitchens. Thanks to the power of the internet, we stayed connected to work, school, friends, and family. We didn’t all have the same tools, however. The digital divide became blisteringly apparent during COVID, as nearly 20% of American households were disconnected from the internet. Typical work-arounds like Wi-Fi at offices, schools, and cafes were not available during the quarantine. So while most Americans kept learning and working remotely, those without broadband fell far behind. It’s obvious by now that the internet is not a luxury. Just like electricity, internet access is essential to modern life. We’ve also learned from the experience of home schooling that the internet is critical to providing equal access to education. Yet too many people still don’t have access. We now have an opportunity to fix this. The historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will upgrade nearly all parts of our country’s infrastructure, including US$65 billion dedicated to improving broadband access. But US$65 billion only goes so far. Even with the expected build-out, current speeds won’t improve much, and slow connections are a big obstacle to remote work and learning. How can we expect people to pull themselves up from their bootstraps if they don’t have access to the internet? This paradigm applies across most parts of the legislation - aviation, renewable energy, waste management, water conservation, and especially public transport. The bill’s investment will get us far, but not quite far enough. The underlying issue is that the US simply does not spend enough to build and maintain high quality infrastructure. We’re the largest economy in the world, yet we lag almost all G20 nations in infrastructure spending, and we rank below average in infrastructure quality rankings. There is an obvious solution here: we need more private funding alongside the public spending. Fortunately, private investors not only have the capital, they also have strong desire to invest in our country’s infrastructure. To put this in context, the legislation allocates US$1.2 trillion in spending, versus the infrastructure funding gap of US$2.6 trillion. US institutional investors could easily make up the shortfall – after all, they represent over US$20 trillion in capacity, some of which is already allocated to infrastructure. (US investors today deploy more to international projects because there are not enough domestic opportunities.) There’s also a misperception that allowing the investment community to participate in these projects will pad the wallets of the super-rich. This is simply untrue and we’ve got to get over it. The vast majority of institutional investment in the US comes from pensions, 401(k)s, and non-profits like foundations, endowments and hospitals. Generating a return on these investments supports retirement, education, philanthropy and healthcare. Infrastructure, in particular, is important for retirement accounts because they have similar timelines. The income streams from projects such as roads and bridges match up nicely against long-term retirement benefits. Infrastructure also aligns with institutional investors’ values. Many universities would like to lower their carbon emissions, and would gladly provide capital to invest in decarbonization pipelines if the opportunities were available. Other investors would help close the digital divide by funding projects that support broadband expansion, satellite internet and fiber. Private investment would also increase accountability and fill gaps with high quality expertise not always available in the public sector. Studies have found that when the private sector is involved, infrastructure projects are more likely to meet deadlines and stay within budget. We have a blueprint for how successful this can be. Canadian pensions have long leveraged infrastructure investments to get retirement dollars to their participants. They view infrastructure as a standalone asset class and allocate significant capital to it, and the Canadian government facilitates this with oversight and support from an infrastructure bank. If we can get all these parts to work similarly in the US, we can fund more improvements that will benefit all Americans. Currently, the legislation does offer a few openings for private public partnerships. We need to encourage the government to incorporate private funding as it administers these projects, and to guide public and private enterprise to work as partners. This would be a winning arrangement that would bring a true alignment of interests and, best of all, would create a shared stake in the future of our country. Read this piece on Fortune.

But history is instructive, and it tells us that times of pain can be ideal moments to position for future gains. As the second half begins, we see: Market direction driven by Fed machinations Need for diversification and resilience in equity portfolios An underappreciated opportunity in healthcare stocks Market overview and outlook The first five months of the year marked the worst start for the S&P 500 since 1970 ― and the sixth worst back to 1928.* While caution is warranted, we believe the equity risk premium (ERP) continues to make a case for equities. Stock valuations have come down, but company earnings remain solid. This keeps the ERP ― which compares the earnings yield on the S&P 500 to bond yields ― above its historical average. Our models suggest the 10-year Treasury yield would have to rise to 4% or earnings decline by more than 20% for the perceived “margin of safety” in stocks over bonds to disappear. Earnings will slow, but 20% is hard to imagine, even in a recession. The average earnings drop in prior recessions was 13%, with the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) skewing the results. See chart below. All eyes on earningsS&P 500 earnings decline in recessions, 1957-2020 Playing offense through defense While it is important to maintain a long-term lens, particularly when investing for long-term goals, it is also prudent to protect and position portfolios for the prevailing environment ― a key advantage of active management. Today’s uncertainty argues for a focus on stability and resilience. Waiting on the Fed The Fed’s ability to raise interest rates and reduce its balance sheet in a way that neither inflames inflation nor stifles economic growth will have significant bearing on the market backdrop. We are not calling for a recession, but we are cognizant that the risks of a recession are rising: The Fed is tightening monetary policy, bringing an end to “easy money” policies; 30-year mortgage rates have climbed from 3% last year to nearly 6% today; inflation is beginning to erode household savings; and inventories of goods are elevated as both pandemic-induced supply shortages and voracious demand ease. If the Fed tightens too much, the result could be a recession. If it tightens too little, inflation is the greater threat. The ideal scenario runs in the middle, allowing for a soft landing as policy transitions. We are not placing odds on any particular outcome but are generally positioning more defensively. The optimal portfolio to combat inflation is very different from the optimal portfolio for a recession. We advocate using a barbell strategy to position for these competing outcomes. This includes owning energy and financials as inflation fighters, and healthcare for a dose of resilience. We find other traditionally defensive sectors, including utilities and staples, to be expensive relative to the broader market. The weight of inflation Notably, our analysis of sector dynamics during the Great Inflation period of the 1970s found energy, financials and healthcare to be the top performers. While the backdrop is different today, we do believe these three sectors could outpace the broader market once again, with financials potentially doing even better in this cycle given stronger bank balance sheets after restructuring and rigorous stress testing in the wake of the GFC. Inflation surfaced as the perceived greatest risk to equity markets over the next six months in a BlackRock Fundamental Equities survey of more than 1,000 U.S. investors. See chart below. What are Americans doing in the face of higher prices? 50% reported reducing their discretionary spending while 26% said they have made no changes. Inflation seen as biggest risk to stocksTop-five concerns among investors surveyed, May 2022 Maintaining a long-term lens Uncertainty is high and daily volatility can test investors’ fortitude. We believe these are the moments when active, fundamental-based stock selection and thoughtful portfolio construction can provide a measure of solace and have a profound impact in the pursuit of long-term financial goals.

       "  'content': ' In the 1985 cult classic “Back to the Future,” actor Michael J. Fox plays a teenager who travels back in time and gets stuck in the past, trying desperately to return “back to the future.” For investors, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ latest inflation report may raise feelings of déjà vu and concerns about economies, and subsequently markets, being stuck in their own time warp; a return to the inflationary 1970s. However, this isn’t the first time the world has been worried about a return to the 1970s. In fact, ever since the 1970s, almost any period of above-consensus inflation has been met with headlines that have alluded to the 1970s in some form or other, a trend perfectly encapsulated in The Economist cover from mid-2004 (see Figure 1). Suffice to say, the 1970s aren’t usually the first thing that comes to mind when we look back at the 2000s from today’s vantage point. Figure 1: 1970s-fearing headlines are not a new phenomenon Source: The Economist, June 19, 2004 Still, maybe 2021 is less different than before, as there are some apparent similarities? We’ve witnessed the end of a long war (Vietnam in the 1970s versus Afghanistan in 2021), we’re in a supply chain crisis (the 1970s was a decade known for shortages) and in the midst of a cold war (substitute the Soviet Union for China). Yet, despite these similarities, there are three main reasons why economies aren’t going back to the 1970s. Three Key Reasons This Isn’t the 1970s for the Economy First, organic demand growth in terms of new disposable income is not going back to the 1970s. In the United States, the share of new workers, as measured by the 15-34 year age group, peaked in 1980 alongside inflation. That age group is an important driver of growth and inflation because, on average, they make several critical first-time purchases, buying their first car, having their first child and buying their first house, often on credit. Separately, another source of new disposable income, female participation in the labor force, had its greatest gain in the 1970s. So, while demand is certainly exceptional today (as we described in our previous commentary, Halloween and Christmas for Markets, these 1970s-era drivers were one-time phenomena. Second, supply and consumption patterns have changed dramatically since the 1970s and are unlikely to reverse course. The development of the global supply chain had two pivotal moments: first, when Deng Xiaopeng opened up China’s economy in 1979, and second, when China joined the WTO in 2001. Each time, world trade inflected higher, dwarfing GDP growth (see Figure 2). These events allowed huge quantities of new supply to enter the global economy, from goods to labor, both flattening the supply curve and pushing it to the right. This deflationary impact of globalization on goods, decade after decade, has allowed consumption to be increasingly oriented around services – until very recently, as the pandemic has temporarily disrupted the consumption of a variety of services. But today’s supply chain bottlenecks, the result of an unusual two-year surge in goods demand, do not foreshadow a systemic unwind of the structure of the global economy, in our view, or of modern consumption patterns (think Millennials’ love of “experiences”). Figure 2: It’s hard to see world trade going back to the 1970s Source: International Monetary Fund, data as of July 31, 2021 Third, we can’t talk about the 1970s without mentioning how influential oil prices were, and how unlikely it is for those influences to repeat themselves. Over the course of that decade, oil prices went from about USD$2 to USD$32, and it’s difficult to see that 16-fold gain in oil prices happening again, given the unique shocks that drove it then, from the end of Bretton Woods to the Iranian Revolution (see Figure 3). In the case of the former, currencies that have been unpegged from a gold standard cannot then be unpegged again. And in the case of the latter, new oil-supply-shock absorbers have been introduced since then: namely OPEC and the rise of the U.S. shale industry. In fact, through a 1970s lens, oil has been stable for decades. Meanwhile, the consumer’s wallet has continued growing alongside, such that consumption is a lot less energy intensive today than it was then. Indeed, gasoline is only about 2% of the U.S. consumer’s wallet today, down from about 6% in 1980. Thus, higher energy prices this winter can lift energy asset prices, in our view, but won’t destroy the consumer’s pocketbook. Figure 3: Through a 1970’s lens, oil has been stable for decades Source: Bloomberg, data as of October 31, 2021 Yet Are There Market and Policy Parallels to the ‘70s? So, economies won’t go back to the 1970s – but it’s a bit more complicated for markets. When real yields are too high or too low, they can flip the traditional stock/bond correlation. In the 1970s, real yields were deeply negative, as they are now. That “1970s style” stock/bond correlation is a worry because modern portfolios are built on risk parity-like characteristics (meaning bond yields are expected to decline when stock prices decline), but current yield levels don’t leave as much room for fixed income to make as much of a positive contribution to portfolios as it has in recent decades. On a shorter lookback, the deeply entrenched long-term correlation between U.S. equity markets (proxied by the S&P 500 here) and U.S. Treasuries has broken down (see Figure 4), injecting volatility into portfolios. In the absence of duration as a reliable hedge, portfolios may need to own volatility through options, or simply hold more cash instead (a measure we previously described in our commentary, The Queen’s Gambit Declined). Figure 4: Correlation between S&P 500 return and 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield Sources: Bloomberg and BlackRock, data as of October 31, 2021 In our view, the single biggest parallel between the 1970s and the 2020s is not inflation, but the ability of extreme monetary policy to influence future market returns. The shock-and-awe policy of the late 1970s came in the form of a policy rate hiking cycle that culminated in a 20% Federal Funds rate to combat inflation. So far in the 2020s, it’s been a doubling of the monetary base – essentially printing USD$3 trillion – to stimulate consumption (Figure 5). Figure 5: Different decade, similar shock-and-awe policy response Source: Federal Reserve, data as of October 31, 2021 Lessons Learned From History Fascinatingly, both these policy measures create the same forward influence on the denominator of the terminal value equation: the discount rate less the growth rate, or “r-g.” By 1980, a high Fed Funds rate meant that portfolios should be oriented around a falling discount rate (“r”) for years afterward, while today’s liquidity regime means that portfolios should be oriented around a sticky high growth rate (“g”) – again, potentially lasting for years. A declining “r,” or a rising “g,” are both supportive of asset prices, mathematically speaking, but the former makes assets with high fixed interest rates exceptionally attractive, while the latter supports assets with cash flows that can capture higher growth rates. So, when it comes to asset allocation, the 1970s do in fact offer a valuable lesson for portfolios in 2021, just not quite a parallel, rather than a yin/yang image: overweight nominal assets in 1980, but overweight real assets today. Indeed, the harder it is for an asset to be printed, the more “real” it is, and if it can generate a steady stream of cash flow, then all the better. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Overview Investors are faced with identifying which companies across industries are best positioned for a new economy shaped by the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement. In this paper, we explore building a Paris-aligned equity strategy as part of a broader multi-asset portfolio and the impact on alpha generation from incorporating sustainable insights. Climate-aware alpha drivers Companies meeting the ambitions set out in the Paris Agreement are increasingly benefiting from higher demand and increased firm value. Climate-aware alphas including carbon resource efficiency, green patents, and corporate target setting are linked to quality measures such as productivity and profitability. Take carbon emissions as an example – firm-level data demonstrates that companies with lower carbon intensity exhibit higher excess returns on average. These companies tend to have a lower cost of capital, higher productivity, and increased efficiency making them better positioned for alpha generation. A critical step to net zero: Decarbonization Along with analyzing carbon emissions data at the company level, incorporating carbon reduction targets at the portfolio level enhances climate outcomes and adds to portfolio returns. Using a minimum requirement of 50% relative carbon reduction vs. the benchmark along with a 7% per annum decarbonization rate allows investors to achieve a true Paris-aligned portfolio forging a path of continued reduction in carbon emissions. Decarbonization path of a portfolio Source: BlackRock, as of June 2021. For illustrative purposes only. The graph shows an illustrative decarbonization path of a Paris-aligned portfolio. Capitalizing on the climate transition Limiting global warming to well below 2ºC and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 are sizable goals that are required in order to avoid the devastating impact of climate change. The reallocation of capital towards technologies, companies and countries fundamental for the energy transition calls for an evolved approach to building equity portfolios. In our view, a Paris-aligned framework considering sustainability alongside traditional risk and return objectives is crucial for capitalizing on the economic shift taking place. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Multi-asset investors: Moving from climate pledges to practice The Paris Agreement seeks to reduce emissions to limit the global temperature increase. This is often equated to transitioning to a “net zero” global economy by 2050. Investors globally are focusing on decarbonization. In March 2021, 22 asset owners with US$1.2 trillion in assets committed to cutting their portfolios’ carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.1 Because so few companies are currently aligned to net zero, we believe it’s impractical to build a diversified net zero portfolio. Rather, aligning a portfolio requires a multi-year pathway. Despite potential benefits to those who are early to the era of climate investing, aligning multi-asset portfolios to net zero comes with unique challenges and is achieved by evolving the integration of ESG considerations into the investment process. A framework is, therefore, our preferred approach as opposed to a single investment decision. This framework should facilitate change but be flexible enough to adapt to the portfolio’s progress in meeting decarbonization targets. Carbon metrics across asset classes To build a portfolio that is aligned to the objectives of the Paris Agreement, we start by assessing various carbon metrics including absolute emissions and emissions intensity. For illustrative purposes, we review absolute emissions and emissions relative to enterprise value for a strategic asset allocation for a UK Defined Contribution pension scheme. We find that the two approaches are complementary. One striking observation is the absolute emissions. Getting this to net zero is a huge task. Intensity allows a more considered view as it adjusts for the size of the underlying companies on a like-for-like basis. We also observe some key implications for multi-asset investors: firstly, no asset class is the same. Different asset classes will have different pathways. Emerging markets, for example, are associated with a higher emissions intensity than developed markets. However, these carbon metrics should serve as a monitoring function rather than an input to dictate investment decisions. these metrics only show part of the picture: a historic snapshot of how these asset classes look today and therefore what the starting point is for the investor. We therefore advocate the use of these metrics for reporting and monitoring purposes. Using forward-looking metrics alongside these will be crucial in the design of the investment strategy. Evolving portfolio monitoring to include “decarbonization milestones” The design of an overarching strategy to align with the Paris Agreement will vary as a function of the portfolio’s asset allocation and investors’ different risk/return objectives. Therefore, there will be no “one size fits all” approach, although there is a common framework that multi-asset investors can apply to their portfolios. Firstly, we advocate setting interim milestones between now and 2050. The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, for example, has proposed setting interim targets for 2030 in order to reduce the uncertainty associated with achieving the appropriate “decarbonization pathway”. We also propose an annual review to ensure the portfolio is on track. This will be in part to ensure that companies who have set targets are meeting them and if not, to set a remediation process (such as through engaging with the company). It is also an opportunity to monitor whether there are new companies setting targets, since this may increase the level of confidence that the decarbonization rate can be met at the overall asset class level. An implementation plan that assesses a range of building blocks In order to build diversified portfolios, we blend index, factor and alpha-seeking strategies. Each building block has its own characteristics and complements the others. Investors can select building blocks that explicitly align with the Paris Agreement. Understanding how each asset class fares today and combining that with forward-looking decarbonization rates guides investors towards which asset classes are most crucial to replace today. Those that are not replaced may still be influenced by a clear voting and engagement policy. We use indexes in portfolio construction to access broad market exposures in a cost-efficient manner. Some screened approaches that eliminate exposure to certain business areas or optimization strategies that seek to enhance the sustainable features within a stated tracking error. Next, factor portfolios invest in broad and persistent drivers of return. Like indexes, factor portfolios can align to the Paris Agreement by systematically incorporating minimum standards for decarbonization and more. Finally, we can use alpha-seeking strategies to access exposures which contribute to the transition with the benefit of potentially brining emissions down and generating alpha. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Had the modern beach ball existed in ancient Greece, many at that time may have had difficulty in understanding why it took so much effort to push it underwater, and why, upon being released underwater, it would jump dramatically from the water before floating in equilibrium at the surface. That is, until Greek mathematician and polymath Archimedes discovered the principle of buoyancy around the year 212 B.C. In some respects, a negative real yield resembles a beach ball being held underwater, in the sense that they are both below their equilibrium levels. Historically, real yields have been correlated with real economic growth, but in 2021 real growth is on track to post its highest reading since World War II, while real yields are at their lowest point in history (see Figure 1). In our analogy, this would create the equivalent of a massive buoyant force on a fully submerged beach ball. In the world of physics, Archimedes’ Principle would allow us to calculate this exact buoyant force, based on factors like the size of the ball and the extent to which it has been submerged, but it is a little more complicated in the world of real yields and portfolios. The financial markets today are huge (certainly much bigger than at any time in history), and the hands pushing real yields down (the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank) are extremely strong. Figure 1: U.S. real yields are near historically low levels, like a beach ball being held underwater Source: Bloomberg, data as of September 14, 2021 Two decades of dramatic market change Interestingly, while real yields are at record lows, the supply of financial assets is at record highs, suggesting a robust demand for income. In the month of September alone, $625 billion of new supply is expected across U.S. Treasury, credit and equity markets, which is considerably greater than the $400 billion monthly average in recent years, according to BlackRock Capital Markets data, as of September 12, 2021. That fact certainly places a potential $15 billion-a-month Fed asset purchase taper into perspective (as it would represent a mere 2% of September’s supply) and it illustrates that quantitative easing (QE) in general is perhaps needlessly competing with organic demand for fixed income assets to keep yields at unsustainably low levels. Central banks’ intent to hold the “real rate beach ball” underwater belies some of the changes that our economy has undergone in just the last two decades. As we remember the 20-year anniversary of 9/11 this month, we are awestruck by some of the changes to markets since that time. Some of those changes include, the evolving nature of e-commerce, the way we interact with each other on social media (spending three hours and 43 minutes each day on our devices, on average) and the huge role China now plays in the global economy. In fact, China has grown its GDP 17x since entering the WTO in 2001, which should perhaps outweigh the Fed taper discussion in terms of long-term investment implications, in our view. Still, arguably the most significant change in financial markets over the last two decades has been one of the most subtle: the onset of the “Liquidity Era” (as we wrote about in The Policy Liquidity Monopoly). Pre-9/11, the real economy was the independent variable that drove financial economy outcomes. However, today it’s the financial economy that is the independent variable driving real economy outcomes. Indeed, liquidity provision has become the primary tool of global monetary policy (rather than interest rate manipulation), through channels like wealth effects, as evidenced by the more than doubling in size of global financial markets relative to world GDP over the last 20 years. It is in this context that we face a liquidity cliff today: having injected nearly $1.5 trillion year-to-date through August, the U.S. Treasury will likely make large liquidity withdrawals before year-end, which could actually transcend ongoing Fed asset purchases. Thus, the flow of liquidity is set to wane demonstrably at a time when real rates are priced through fair value. Yet even with new liquidity injections becoming greatly diminished, the existing stock of liquidity, both domestically and globally, is historic, with investors who are sitting on cash salivating over any yield, or return potential, of reasonable quality that looks to be available. In fact, growth in cash has far outpaced growth in loan demand since the onset of the pandemic, leaving banks flush with deposits and starved for yield (see Figure 2). As a result, trillions of dollars in bank deposits continue to compete with traditional fixed income investors for relatively scarce high-quality assets. Figure 2: U.S. cash deposits have greatly outstripped loan growth Sources: Federal Reserve and Bloomberg, data as of August 31, 2021 Indeed, there is so much cash (liquidity) in the world and such low yields that one might even forget that in an equilibrium state the “beach ball” floats on the surface of the water. Having posted roughly a 12% total return year-to-date, through September 14, the 60/40 balanced portfolio (60% S&P 500, 40% U.S. Aggregate Bond) is on pace to beat 2020’s handsome return of 14%. But unlike in 2019 and 2020, in which both the equity and fixed income sides of the portfolio contributed to total returns, in 2021 so far only the equity portion has made a positive contribution. The fact is that from these levels of yield, it is extremely difficult to preserve purchasing power in fixed income, revealing the difficulty in getting the “40%” of the balanced portfolio to contribute to price returns. Why is such easy policy being maintained? Some believe that technology will eliminate jobs that were lost during the pandemic, such that job growth will slow from here, rendering a full recovery in labor force participation impossible. However, historical newspaper records show that this fear of technology “stealing jobs” has been around for centuries, as every new technology has replaced an older one, with no evidence of a decline in aggregate jobs available (in fact, they have grown in line with population growth). The reality of the labor market today is quite the opposite of this dire view: labor supply is more constrained relative to demand than ever before. There are 70% more job openings than there were pre-pandemic and 10% fewer people looking for work – the largest gap between those measures in history. Others argue that if inflation is transitory that should mitigate risks to keeping policy easy (in other words, letting the economy run hot). In our view, while recent inflation should moderate toward historical averages over time, the risk of deflation at this stage seems even more remote, given how far above trend inflation stands today (see Figure 3). So, the balance of probabilities actually suggests a normalization of policy could be a risk-mitigant rather than the other way around, when it comes to price stability. Figure 3: Core CPI is running considerably higher than Its pre-covid trend Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, data as of August 31, 2021 Another, potentially greater, risk of keeping policy too easy for too long is financial asset inflation. While valuations in housing and stock markets are not in bubble territory yet, in our estimation, keeping policy too easy for too long may create the risk of financial instability going forward. Given how the financial economy has become the independent variable driving real economy outcomes, a volatile financial economy could create unstable real economy outcomes. Indeed, house prices are less affordable (relative to income levels) than at any time since the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, resulting in declining consumer confidence of late. The main problem today is a supply shortage, not one of weak demand, and supply can’t be “stimulated” by monetary policy in the way that demand can. If central banks don’t gradually normalize policy, demand can continue to push higher, well through supply availability (of goods, services, houses, labor, etc.), creating a risky and unnecessary inflationary shock – at the very least in financial assets. Hence, we need to think about portfolio balance in 2021 in the context of drastically different environmental conditions relative to history - where supply is weighing on growth, and not demand – with demand for goods, services, and assets being pushed higher via further policy liquidity injections. So, how do we manage a portfolio in light of these crosscurrents? Rather than suggesting a greater risk premium be applied to equities, low interest rates and strong growth can be a powerful cocktail for risky assets. If interest rates are capped to the upside by waiting on a pre-pandemic notion of full employment, textbook financial analysis suggests that it can create powerful convexity in the terminal value of equities. Historically, risk-free rates would approximate terminal growth, both reflecting the same economy, and keeping a company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) somewhat in line with its terminal growth rate. But Fed policy essentially has the terminal growth rate acting as a ceiling for the cost of debt (a component in the WACC), creating massive convexity in the terminal value because the cost of debt can go below, but not above, the terminal growth rate (see Figure 4). Figure 4: Recent fed policy essentially sets economic growth rate as ceiling for risk-free cost of debt Source: Bloomberg, data as of September 14, 2021 So, despite the 60/40 portfolio being “imbalanced” (where the 40% fixed income allocation has been underperforming relative to history), the same low-rate and high-growth backdrop that is creating this imbalance also gives us some comfort in the power of an equity allocation. We take further comfort in the fact that recent equity performance has not been just a market phenomenon – book value has also been accreting at the fastest pace in decades. In fact, the average level of S&P 500 return on equity (ROE) never dipped below 15% throughout the pandemic and it is expected to reach a record 23% by the end of 2021, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates, as of September 10 (see Figure 5). If book value continues to accrete higher at this pace, the media’s fascination with records may be satiated for a long time to come, as equity market values rise in tandem to fresh record high levels. Figure 5: The SPX return on equity has remained remarkably strong throughout the pandemic Source: Bloomberg, data as of September 10, 2021 Some companies are significantly outperforming even the lofty ROE gains of the index. The equity of companies that are on the “right side” of megatrends, especially in the technology and healthcare sectors, have historically been the greatest beneficiaries of high-growth and low-rate environments (see Figure 6). And there has arguably never been a better environment for book value accretion, and hence return, for these kinds of companies. We like companies with long forward trajectories of growing cash flows and strong balance sheets that are investing significantly on capital expenditures (capex) and research & development (R&D) to drive growth. The combination of long-term investment, plentiful cash, and low debt burdens suggests a medium-term permanence to cash flow growth. Such companies have come to dominate the market capitalization leaderboard in the S&P 500 over the last 20 years. That trend is likely to continue, as technology-enabled creative destruction continues to keep opportunities open for new companies to disrupt old ones, also resulting in exciting private and venture investments on the horizon. Of course, with the many headline risks facing markets today (China worries, debt ceiling debates, Fed asset purchase tapering), alongside some supply-chain troubles and slower economic growth (at a time of year when investment conviction and risk-taking tend to be lower), the risk of equity markets pricing down 5%, or so, has moved higher. Still, we think any short-term disruption is likely to be modest before equities continue to move higher. Figure 6: Return on equity of key sectors can be even greater Source: Bloomberg, data as of August 9, 2021 China is another area that we think stands out, for having an inconsistent representation in the global economy versus the financial markets. While China is slated to make up about 20% of the global economy five years from now, up from 18% today (see Figure 7), and a close second to the U.S. in its overall economic size, at $24 trillion versus $28 trillion (International Monetary Fund estimates, as of December 31, 2020), its representation in global indices is a mere 4% in the MSCI All Country World Index and a slightly better 7% in the Global Aggregate bond index. Currently, only three of the top 100 companies in the world (by market capitalization) are China-based today, yet China is the second largest source of unicorns (startups with a >$1 billion valuation), after the U.S. That suggests that places like China may offer targeted, high-growth opportunities for investment, albeit with some patience in the broader market, amidst an evolving regulatory framework. In the short run, we think it’s important to remain cautious about where and how one takes advantage of investment opportunities in China, but it’s also a time when longer-term opportunities are presenting themselves. Figure 7: China’s rapidly growing share of economic activity isn’t yet reflected in equity and bond index representation Source: International Monetary Fund, data as of December 31, 2020 The phenomenon of central banks crowding investors out of high-quality fixed income suggests that portfolio balance should indeed mean owning less of the low yielding, high-quality, part of the investment universe, with a larger allocation to yields that look more reasonable relative to inflation expectations, particularly in bespoke and less-liquid regions of fixed income, with a moderate emerging market debt allocation. With securitized markets growing again, securitized products may offer another such source of reasonable yield, especially on unique pools of assets that help with diversification (see Figure 8). We think high-quality securitized assets are too rich, but we like mid-quality paper (with proper underwriting). Taking a closer look at the capital stack, it’s evident that there are limited opportunities to take risk and still get attractive yield. One simply must work harder to find, structure, and analyze potential investments today. Figure 8: Securitized markets offer another potential source of reasonable yield Source: J.P. Morgan, data as of July 6, 2021 Last month, we posed the question of what to do with high quality fixed income in this submerged beach ball environment, in order to create balance in a portfolio, and our answer was: little (as we wrote about in Being Vested in Your Investing). The Agg has returned 0.06% since August 1, 2021, underscoring that point. In high quality fixed income, we are not sure where the value is today either. The threat of submerged (negative) real yields succumbing to buoyant forces and violently returning to their position of equilibrium as policy evolution looms is causing a lot of consternation in the financial media. To us, it simply reinforces the notion of being committed to names that have some combination of risk premium, growth potential and winning track records. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Assessing inflation in interesting times Predicting inflation under normal circumstances is hard enough. The worldwide uncertainty surrounding COVID vaccines and variants, fiscal and monetary policy responses, and changing behaviors compounds this difficulty. Our Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions (MASS) team lays out how we assess inflation drivers and respond to help clients build resilient portfolios. Long-term sustained rise, short-term uncertainty Potential reasons for higher prices include higher production costs and deglobalization in the wake of COVID, new central bank policies that allow inflation “overshoots” to make up for past misses, and a risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored amid greater debt loads. We believe inflation is likely to be higher in the medium to long-term and portfolios should be positioned for this potential shift. However, we should avoid extrapolating too much from the extraordinarily high inflation readings in recent months, as they have been driven by factors that we feel are unlikely to be repeated over time. Putting it in practice As we seek to build portfolios that are more resilient to inflation, our portfolio construction approach is both diversified – deploying a wide universe of instruments and exposures – and dynamic – adaptable as circumstances change. For example, we may express our views on inflation in multi-asset portfolios by reducing exposure to fixed income while diversifying into equities that can protect against inflation such as banks and energy stocks. We can also allocate to asset classes like commodities and inflation-linked bonds. A long-term lens The importance of employing a diversified approach goes beyond these tactical expressions of our views. Our research suggests that stocks and bonds are more highly correlated in higher inflation regimes. As shown in below, the sensitivity of the stock-bond correlation to inflation has approached global highs as coordinated policy response to COVID has made inflation a key macro driver of asset prices. The implication for portfolios is that bonds may serve as a less effective source of diversification in high inflation environments. We assert that this calls for a thoughtful, whole portfolio approach to meeting client’s investment objectives.

       "  'content': ' What to expect Global real assets investors have been increasingly focused on inflation, as surging demand and stockpiling alongside supply constraints is driving up price pressures. In this paper, we discuss our views on inflation, whether it is transitory and where it will go. More importantly, we will discuss the reasons why real assets may perform well in periods of higher inflation, and tools and strategies real assets investors should deploy in a higher inflationary environment. Higher, not runaway Economic reopening, combined with record levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus, higher production costs and realignment of global supply chains is driving a robust outlook for economic growth and the highest inflation expectations in almost a decade. Inflation should build steadily over the medium term, well above the Fed’s 2% target. Supply constraints and surging demand will likely keep short-term inflation more volatile. The BlackRock Investment Institute (BII) sees inflation near 3% in five years, above current breakeven rates, but well below 1970s levels of hyperinflation. Inflation-linked Returns from both real estate and infrastructure have positive correlation to inflation, especially when it is combined with high economic growth. Real assets can capture inflation through greater income growth due to higher rent growth, occupancy, and increased demand for the underlying good such as electricity. The risk of accelerated expense growth is primarily mitigated through (1) contractual adjustments in leases or contracts, (2) expense pass-throughs, (3) higher replacement costs, and (4) beneficial leverage. Real assets have historically outperformed in inflationary environments Real assets outperform traditional asset classes during high inflation environments.

The figures shown relate to past performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. You cannot invest directly in an unmanaged index. High growth periods are when U.S. GDP > 2.5% and high inflation periods are when U.S. CPI > 2.5%. Focus on what you can control Inflation, interest rates and rents or rates are determined by the market and cannot be controlled by investors. Thus, it is best to focus on what one can control when structuring deals and building portfolios. Term & structure: Shorter lease terms would allow rents to mark-to-market more often, thus benefitting the investor. While longer-term, take-or-pay contracts for midstream investments could also offer some degree of explicit inflation management as revenues rise with higher demand. Leases or contracts with annual bumps in-line with inflation and expense pass throughs are preferred. Asset characteristics: Assets in low supply markets will likely benefit from a high growth and inflationary environment. What is more important than the topic of inflation are the accelerating trends of e-commerce, migration to less dense areas, digitization and decarbonization driving the different real assets sectors. Debt term & structure: Levered assets with longer-term fixed rate debt would benefit in an inflationary environment, as debt gets paid down with inflated dollars over time. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Our approach to impact investing in public equities We believe an impact investing strategy in public equities should be built on the foundational concept of “additionality.” Additionality in this context means that, but for this contribution, that outcome would not have occurred, so impact is created. It’s key to the impact approach. Explore how innovative businesses deliver positive impact to people and the planet in two examples below. Additionality is the key to driving impact For a company to provide additionality based on our standard, a majority of its products and services must address a need that is unlikely to be fulfilled by others (such as competitors or governments), thereby creating a genuine impact that addresses that need. We also require additionality from ourselves as investors. With a long-term, ownership mindset, impact investors in public equities create impact by providing an exit for private enterprises pursuing impact; supplying the capital needed for impact companies to grow; engaging with companies to enhance impact outcomes; increasing the visibility of undervalued impact companies, and democratizing access to impact investing. At the asset class level, by offering impact investing through public equities, a broad new cohort of investors can participate and provide much needed capital to solve some of the world’s great problems. It is long past time for the democratization of impact investing. Impact on people: solutions spotlight on Bank Rakyat Based on our research as of 2020, Bank Rakyat is the largest microlender and financial services provider in Indonesia, where approximately half the adult population remains unbanked. In addition to microlending, the bank provides services including financial literacy training programs, savings vehicles and insurance products, helping to foster financial resilience, empowerment and economic opportunity for underserved communities. Bank Rakyat’s microlending business targets micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, rural communities and underserved individuals. Indonesia is an archipelago with over 10,000 islands; approximately 6,000 of them are inhabited. Due to the dispersed population across these thousands of islands, it is difficult to scale traditional business models that rely on physical locations. Bank Rakyat has built a financial agent network that allows its services to reach even the most rural areas of Indonesia’s islands, reflecting an innovative business model specific to local needs. Impact on the planet: solutions spotlight on Vestas Wind Systems As a wind energy and technology leader, Vestas designs, manufactures, installs and services wind turbines globally. It is responsible for a diverse portfolio of wind turbines that can operate in multiple environments, even in extreme weather conditions, onshore and offshore.1 Vestas’ strategy seeks to expand the world’s use of wind energy through its leading, efficient technology and lower-cost business model. Vestas’ advanced technology also increases the efficiency of renewable energy generation, with a single wind turbine producing 30 to 50 times more energy than it consumes in a lifetime.2 Wind energy grew by 23% annually between 1990-2018, and we believe wind power is positioned for continued, structural growth.3 Since inception in 1981 through 2020, Vesta’s operations have avoided 1.4 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions,4 which is the equivalent of avoiding the emissions from 1 billion passenger vehicles driven in one year.

       "  'content': ' Overview In 2020, China’s onshore equity and bond markets grew to over US$23 trillion in assets, but exposure to China remains only a small fraction of most investor’s portfolios. As we look ahead into the rest of 2021 and beyond, China has been top of mind for many of our clients. It’s huge, it’s growing, it’s ripe with risks and opportunities, but how does it fit into portfolios? To help us distill the rapidly changing dynamics of investing in China, Rui Zhao, Portfolio Manager for Systematic Active Equity’s China strategies, and Philip Hodges, CIO of Factor-Based Strategies, give us a run-down of how to tap into the best opportunities in the Chinese markets and how systematic investing creates differentiated insights to seize those investment opportunities. What do you think makes China a great investment opportunity now? Philip Hodges: The opportunities that come from investing in onshore China can be distilled into several components. It’s the second-largest economy in the world with steep growth trajectory. The country is also shifting from exports to domestic consumption, with a big middle class to fuel that consumption. Additionally, China has been making heavy investments in technology, seeing a revolution in productivity, liberating financial markets, and opening up to foreign investors. The opportunity in China is big, and when most people think about onshore investments, they think A Shares. China’s A-share market consists of over 4,100 companies, and has a combined market capitalization of over US$16 trillion, making it one of the largest equity markets in the world.1 Similarly, China’s onshore bond market is roughly US$14 trillion, making it the second-largest bond market in the world.2 Despite the size of these markets, it is currently under-owned. Foreign investors hold just 3.5% of the broad market in China.3 China has shown great support for economic globalization and is already making strides to open its markets to the rest of the world. China’s economic circumstances present a potentially compelling opportunity, but current investment processes must evolve in order for investors to tap into this market. How did you choose to respond to the 2020 investment landscape? Also, as an investor in the Chinese markets, how will you continue to address the potential uncertainty from this drawn-out pandemic in the year ahead? Rui Zhao: China’s digital economy has been growing rapidly over the past few years and was especially accelerated during the pandemic, which has made more data available in just the past year alone. When China went into lockdown in January 2020 due to COVID-19, information about what companies were doing was very unknown. However, despite the uncertainty associated with COVID-19, investment decisions could benefit from many years of data accumulation. Relying on alternative data helps answer basic investor questions such as, “Which companies or industries will benefit the most from the pandemic?” and “Which companies are having their workers return to work, and when will those companies start producing again?” Systematic research methods were key to understanding China’s investment landscape because it allowed us to deeply understand the evolution of company fundamentals during an unprecedented time. Onboarding more types of data and developing better machine learning models for analysis have always been our research focus. This has also allowed us to make more informed decisions about a company’s future growth, the quality of management, as well as a company’s ESG profile. Can you comment on overall volumes and changes in market participants? Rui Zhao: We have seen an increase in market turnover throughout the past year. This can be attributed to both domestic retail and institutional investors, as well as global investors. As of today, the Stock Connect Northbound flow which refers to Chinese mainland-listed stocks traded on the Hong Kong Stock exchange – has reached 2.1 trillion RMB, which is more than US$300 billion. After a decade of investor education, domestic funds are finally becoming attractive among retail investors, and we’ve also seen the total number of ETFs holdings double over the past two years. This can be a sign that more retail investors are starting to increase their trust in professionals to manage their assets, rather than making those investment decisions themselves. In 2020, growth seemed to have a tight linear relationship with active return. How do you think this played out in China and how did China Opportunities respond? Rui Zhao: Over the past year, we have seen the market become more concentrated. For example, when we look at exposures, we see it centered around high growth and high volatility stocks. These factor exposures are approaching a historically high level, which happened twice in the past; once in 2008 and again in 2015. We’re not saying that the market is crashing any time soon, but it’s important to note that the level of concentration has been quite extreme. In this environment, we believe that our diversified risk control strategy will really help our clients diversify away from some of the idiosyncratic risk. Briefly, what does correlation look like among China macro factors? Additionally, what does that do to a portfolio? Philip Hodges: In terms of diversification, we saw very low negative correlations in many places across most Chinese assets. We’re used to seeing lower negative correlations in the developed market between equities and bonds, but we don’t always see that in emerging markets. We definitely see that in China. Chinese government bonds are a flight to quality assets that perform well to hedge equity risk. In credit, the situation is even rosier. Chinese corporates have a low to negative correlation both with government bonds and equities. And this is true even if you strip out the interest rate component and just look at credit spreads. In developed markets, we’re used to pretty high correlations between credit spreads and equity markets. That level of diversification still exists in the Chinese market. Given these low correlations, it’s perhaps not surprising that a diversified multi-asset China portfolio is a good way to steadily accrue risk premia and benefit from Chinese growth.

Beyond the world of equities, how does adding other asset classes into the investment mix change risk profiles and overall return potential? Philip Hodges: There are other asset classes that diversify risk premia not just to Chinese equities, but to other traditional exposures that you may have in your portfolio. China’s bond market, for example, has more than 90% of it held domestically.4 Those interest rate exposures tend to offer much higher premia than in developed market equivalents. In the corporate bond space, risk-adjusted yield and income tend to be higher than developed market equivalents as well. If you look at the world global bonds that are yielding more than 2.5%, over 50% of those are onshore Chinese bonds.5 Additionally, we did some work looking at commodity investments and constructible indices, showing that if you tilt towards commodities that are most heavily consumed by China, they tend to offer a higher premium, outperforming in-line with Chinese growth. Chinese equities have experienced quite a lot of volatility, but diversified portfolios tend to move more in line and more consistently with Chinese growth. If we drill into some of the biggest peaks and draw-downs in the equity markets, in 2008, MSCI China A was down 64%. Over the same period, a levered multi-asset portfolio with 100% allocation to rates (5Y China Interest Rate swap), 50% allocation to credit (China Bond 3-5Y IG Credit total return index) and 25% allocation to equity (MSCI China A) would have been up around 1% in 2008.6 So, we see plenty of opportunities for a multi-asset approach in China as diversified risk premia in different asset classes in a balanced portfolio tend to offer pretty good diversifying returns against traditional global investment.

       "  'abstract': 'Impact investing in public equities can help accomplish two objectives: generate financial outperformance and provide a differentiated source of alpha. Read more in our report.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Overview Our research shows that impact investing in public equities can help accomplish two crucial investment objectives: generate financial outperformance and provide a differentiated source of alpha versus global equities. Inspired by the foundational framework in Grinold and Kahn’s “Fundamental Law of Active Management,”1 we extend the concept of breadth to analyze the opportunity for alpha in impact investing in public equities. We also illustrate how impact investments can work to enhance a whole portfolio’s structure by improving diversification, increasing the potential for financial performance while mitigating risk. What is the impact universe? The impact universe is made up of companies whose core products or services help solve the world’s great social and environmental challenges. Consisting of approximately 600 publicly traded companies as of March 31, 2020, the universe has been built by BlackRock based on proprietary, fundamental research. To qualify for the universe, companies must meet the criteria of “materiality” and “additionality.” The materiality requirement insists that greater than 50% of a company’s revenues or business activity must come from products or services helping to solve major social or environmental problems (such as those represented by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets2). Additionality requires that a company’s products or services must address a need that is unlikely to be fulfilled by others (such as competitors or governments). Applying the concept of “breadth” Differentiated market inefficiencies in public equities impact investing reflect breadth and the potential opportunity for capturing alpha. Impact companies have higher standard deviation of returns versus global equities, leading to a wider set of risks and opportunities that can be exploited in seeking to generate alpha. Impact companies demonstrate a higher and more frequent dispersion of returns versus global equities, representing another market inefficiency (see chart below). Next, impact companies have lower coverage by sell-side analysts, which we see as an opportunity.3 Notably, the impact opportunity set has low overlap in names with major indices, adding to breadth and the opportunity to generate alpha.4 Finally, impact companies cannot be systematically identified5, and therefore are often misclassified or misunderstood, offering significant opportunity. Rolling 12-month standard deviation of daily returns Five-year ending March 2020 Source: BlackRock, with data from Bloomberg ending March 2020. Defined as average standard deviation of daily returns trailing 12 months across underlying holdings (BlackRock’s proprietary Impact Universe and MSCI Indices); 5-year period ending March 2020. Indices are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Complementary roles in a portfolio asset allocation structure Impact investing in public equities has characteristics that can serve important roles in a portfolio’s strategic asset allocation structure. Investing in impact companies provides exposure to structural growth. Additionally, with lower valuations across standard equity metrics such as Price/Earnings, Price/Cash Flow, and more, many companies in our impact universe are less expensive than global equities.6 As previously noted, because impact companies are (i) more neglected by analysts, (ii) have low overlap in names compared to traditional equity indices, (iii) are often misclassified by industry frameworks, (iv) cannot be identified by systematic screening and (v) have business models that can be driven by megatrends, impact companies can offer exposure to these segments of the market and enhance portfolio diversification. In a portfolio that already has private market impact investments, public equities impact investing provides exposure to companies that are typically at a different stage of growth in their business lifecycle as they scale their business models. Finally, impact investing in public equities serves as a complement to other sustainability vehicles. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this blog, we explore the potential of private financing arrangements and why global investors are looking to put capital to work in Chinese markets.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Overview Two powerful trends are converging - companies are increasingly realizing the potential of private financing arrangements, while global investors are looking to put capital to work in Chinese markets. Mark Everitt, Head of Investment Research and Strategy for Blackrock Alternative Investors, recently led a discussion on the trends, challenges and opportunities in Chinese private markets, with a particular focus on the credit and real estate markets. We present highlights below. Participants were Connie Peng, Head of China, Global Real Estate; Celia Yan, Head of China and Co-portfolio manager of the Asia Pacific Private Credit; Mike Dennis, Head of Alternative Strategy and Capital Markets for Asia-Pacific; and Jim Barry, CIO of BlackRock Alternatives. How have Chinese private markets evolved? When looking at the future of Chinese private markets one of the most important themes is going to be the evolution of a bipolar world, with China on one side and the U.S. on the other. China is now pivotal to all our thinking. It’s too big of a market environment to ignore. Especially with COVID, where China was the first major world economy to return to growth, we’ve all been looking there to see what lies ahead for the rest of us. Despite this growth, many non-Chinese investors are still underexposed to the country’s financial markets. However, the changes over the past decades have been transformational. The equity market in Hong Kong is now four times the size of the London Stock Exchange and 60% the size of the New York Stock Exchange. The average daily turnover on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange recently stood at about US$25 billion, up from US$10 billion a year before. China has the second-most unicorns (privately held startup company valued at over US$1 billion) in the world.1 First, structural reform. Many of us are used to thinking of China as having high legal jurisdiction risk and restrictive capital controls. But the Chinese government has been improving insolvency, credit protection frameworks, transparency and its restructuring regime. For example, a new bankruptcy law allows bankrupt companies up to nine months of restructuring. And we’ve seen some defaults by state-owned enterprises, or SOEs, which have historically had access to capital based partly on political considerations. These developments pave the way for more efficient allocation of financial resources, and as such, global managers can now establish local businesses to build onshore alternative investment capabilities to target rising demands. The second point relates to the breadth of opportunities. We’re seeing a healthier and deeper market. Private market activity traditionally was heavily skewed toward domestic investors, but now there is a real desire to partner with international expertise as the country builds deeper and more robust markets. In the past, banks have dominated this market. But as regulators push the country toward a less bank-centric system, we’re seeing a greater understanding in corporate China of how companies can work with flexible private financing throughout the capital structure to achieve their goals. Private credit has room to grow Percentage of credit to corporates from non-bank channels Source: Bank of International Settlements. Accurate as of 30 September 2020. What are some trends in Chinese private credit and real estate? There are currently four top trends in private credit: Demand for financing is exceeding supply; there are more opportunities for growth financing; private credit has been resilient; and credit managers and companies increasingly are working as partners. Chinese banks tend to overlook small to mid-sized companies, but their need for financing still exists and is increasing. Corporations’ growing understanding of their private credit options is helping produce continuous demand. As a result, we’re seeing a scalable opportunity with a very attractive risk-adjusted return premium. The second trend is opportunities in growth sectors like technd media. Private lending in China has always focused on sectors like distressed and asset-backed financing. As the service sector has grown, we’re able to fill the financing gap for those companies as well. Third, credit proved its resilience in China through COVID-19. Private credit performance has been relatively stable, with low correlations to other markets. It has outperformed not just on return but also on risk, which we think are very important for investors facing uncertainties from both COVID and politics. Fourth, the market is shifting to a more proactive approach to sourcing and lending. Credit managers now can work as lending partners to companies and helping generate post-investment value, bringing business expertise and sometimes a “stamp of approval” to the relationship in addition to just financing. In real estate, with COVID-19 under control in China we expect volumes to start to recover in 2021, particularly in the office and logistics sectors. Our view is that the impact of COVID-19 on China’s office sector will be short-term and limited. People started to return to work in April last year, and by May, occupancy was back to pre-COVID levels. While some sectors have been massively impacted by COVID, other sectors benefit from the new normal, such as online education and IT. And as China further opens its financial sector, this is an exciting market to diversify into. Considering all these factors, the impact of COVID-19 on office buildings in China should be relatively short-term. We also are interested in logistics, which is vibrant in China as it is elsewhere. As the pandemic accelerated ecommerce, it provided strong fundamentals for investing in this sector. What are the main positives and challenges you see? We should expect some market volatility in the near term as the government tries to improve market practices. This is good news for us because the market shocks from policy changes will create some funding gaps that we can address as private credit lenders. We also see continued demand for capital, for growth financing and for distressed and turnaround financing. Now, we have access to a diversified base of financing opportunities to scale across different market cycles and regions. At the same time, transparency in China is improving, especially for data verification. For example, with the development of mobile payments, it’s a lot easier to verify sales and cash flows. We also see the governance and transparency improvements reflected in the growing market share of the big four accounting firms and the international consulting firms. Reforms and greater transparency help address some of the challenges in Chinese private credit, but we can’t mitigate all of the risk. Therefore, we need to make sure we have enough return premium, structure deals in ways that provide downside protection, engage in extensive post-investment management and keep loan-to-values low to increase our margin of safety. Another positive development is that the first REIT was launched last year, and as more REITs enter the market it is seen as improving the liquidity of Chinese real estate. Other developments are the increase in scale and the fact that foreign direct investment is still a very key objective for all levels of government. Considering these challenges, you have to be mindful that this is a big, complex market with its own dynamics, and there’s no substitute for deep local knowledge. The logistics market is a case point. The so-called tier one market has 26 cities, and each city has eight to nine submarkets. To understand the tier-one market, we need to study over 200 submarkets. Final thoughts Number one, we’re heading into an environment where China and the U.S. are increasingly becoming more separate ecosystems, and the Chinese government understands the need for international investors. Second, there’s a concern about long-term liquidity risk, but we don’t see it in the reality of owning private companies in China. For example, there’s been an explosion in IPOs both in Hong Kong and in the U.S. We believe if investors can separate the real risk from the perceived risk, then they may stand to benefit from looking at the private market opportunities across China.

Growth equity opportunity Until quite recently, growth equity was a nascent area of the private equity market where technology companies were bootstrapped prior to IPO. Today, the growth equity market has matured to USD 113 billion of deal activity last year, up from USD 24 billion in 2010 (see chart below). In years past, it was exceedingly rare for companies to achieve a USD 1 billion valuation without access to public capital (hence the name “unicorn” to describe the statistical rarity). Today there are close to 500 companies boasting this status, turning their once mythical status into a more common sighting.1 U.S. private markets growth equity activity Growth equity market has matured to USD 113 billion of deal activity Source: Pitchbook, 2021 Annual U.S. PE Breakdown. Above information represents private equity growth equity investment from 2010 to 2021 in the United States. Data-driven approach If growth equity companies are staying private longer, it may be no surprise that private and public company data footprints are increasingly similar. While private companies have the luxury of forgoing the formal data disclosures required of publicly traded companies, digital footprints are not obscured by the difference in capital markets construct. Reimagined portfolios The ability to recognize and source new investment opportunities is arguably the most important function of the growth equity investment process. Historically, sourcing the attractive deals has been relationship-based. Today, data science techniques have raised the bar, allowing pioneering managers to look beyond their network and proactively detect attractive company characteristics using predictive models. Systematic models offer scalability, enhanced efficiency and improved portfolio outcomes by evaluating a universe of thousands of securities. A systematic approach offers investors the opportunity to uncover opportunities that traditional methods and models may have overlooked, with a faster view and with a higher degree of certainty.

High and persistent inflation can become more difficult to eliminate outside of a recession, and those risks are important to assessing credit fundamentals. No longer a rising tide Regime change is difficult to quantify, especially when it is occurring in real time.

       "  'content': \" Setting the scene The world’s hunt for income and yield has been an issue for decades that will likely continue. People are living longer and retiring in record numbers, while Covid-19 triggered a race to near- zero interest rates in developed countries. The U.S. currently has US$17+ trillion worth of bonds with negative yields, which is roughly the size of the entire Chinese bond market, where most bonds yield more than 2.5% are found (see chart below). We believe the recent strong net inflows validates the attractiveness of Chinese fixed income markets and are indicative of future flows. Global investors have historically shied away from owning Chinese assets citing a lack of market sophistication and limits on ability to access the onshore markets. Portfolios have traditionally held very small quantities of Chinese assets via aggregate emerging market (EM) exposures. This is changing rapidly. Recent inflows reflect the larger Chinese representation in international indices, but also growing recognition that Chinese markets are entering a more mature phase well-positioned to help the global investor. A few catalysts are: Global bonds yielding more than 2.5% by market Source: BlackRock, Wind, December 2020. Based on the Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse and all eligible China onshore bonds - both rates and credit bonds (>1billion CNY size, >1 year maturity). DM and EM stand for developed and emerging markets, respectively. Does index inclusion help open up Chinese bonds to foreign investors? China has the world's second- largest bond and credit markets after the U.S. Inbound flows have indeed accelerated due to inclusion in global indices, but credit bonds aren’t in this scope, leaving out a large portion of the investable universe where attractive opportunities lie. The Chinese bond market is about US$17 trillion1, surpassed only by the US$49 trillion2 market. Index inclusion has eased Chinese bonds into asset allocation considerations, while offering a fairer representation in international indices. In December 2020, Chinese bonds accounted for about 6% of the Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse Index, the broadest measure for global fixed income. However, credit bonds, a significant part of the investable universe aren’t part of the inclusion (see the Two bond types chart). This is important because investors that are benchmark constrained or aware, may not benefit from the potential alpha generation that credit offers (assuming investors can navigate certain complexities of Chinese credit markets). State-owned enterprises (SOEs) represent over a quarter of China’s onshore credit market (see chart). The SOEs’ significance varies widely between central and local governments and understanding their relative rank may prove as crucial to understanding the issuer’s standalone fundamentals to determine its creditworthiness. The different methodologies used by domestic and international credit rating agencies create another set of complexities. Understanding these differences is critical to assessing ratings fairly, especially since domestic agencies dominate in this market. Two bond types Composition of China’s onshore bond market, 2020 Source: Wind, December 2020. Policy bank bonds are owned by the central government and serve policy function; local government bonds are offered by the provinces. What are the diversification benefits of Chinese bonds? Chinese bonds can offer portfolio ballast, attractive yield and diversification based on the onshore and offshore nature of the market.3 Drivers of uncorrelated returns The Chinese bond market can go beyond addressing the need for yield in the post-Covid-19 world. The ‘More than a yield pick up’ chart alludes to potential benefits from diversifying into China’s credit - higher yields and income per unit of risk to the equivalent U.S. bonds, even unhedged. This compliments the dual diversification potential of the low correlations between China and other major bond markets and among the onshore RMB and offshore USD Chinese credit markets – highlighted in the Alpha opportunity through tactical allocation chart. In China, yields from the same issuer may differ across markets, enabling managers to exploit such differentials for alpha generation, while taking similar credit risks. Risk-free rates vary by market. Onshore credits are RMB-denominated and sensitive to Chinese monetary conditions and other onshore-market factors. Most offshore credits are U.S.-dollar denominated, subject to global risk factors. More than a yield pick up U.S. corporate yield and various credit yields in China, 2020 Source: Bloomberg.

This information should not be relied upon by the reader as research, investment advice or a recommendation. What about default risk? Chinese bond defaults still lag other high yield markets. Even though we may see an increase in Chinese credit defaults this year, we do not see it as a systemic risk. China’s willingness to make financial reforms quickly, can have a meaningful impact on credit quality and transparency. We see a potential uptick in Chinese credit defaults this year, but not enough to pose systemic risks to the onshore bond market. China’s default rate significantly lags that of its global counterparts, despite pandemic-related stresses. For example, annual defaults in U.S. high yield nearly doubled last year, and while reversion to pre-Covid-19 levels is plausible, in 2021 U.S. defaults may top China’s by nearly a two-to-one ratio (see the Staying in business chart). Stories about the rising risks of Chinese defaults have grabbed attention from many global investors, masking what in our view should be their main concern: the sustainability of returns. The speed and efficacy at which China can forge its financial markets’ reforms should have more meaningful and lasting effects than any isolated event. Defaults are part of the story; they just aren’t the main part. The initial wave of defaults preceded the escalation of the U.S. China trade tensions in 2018, which cut short the government’s deleveraging effort, as further aggravated in Q1 2020 by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, China’s V-shaped economic recovery facilitates a return to the deleveraging path. We see this gaining force by this year’s second half, along with tightening to prevent overheating, especially in the hot property sector. This scenario fits well within a bigger picture. Chinese regulators have long sought to raise the financial market transparency and support paths toward maturity in the credit cycle (e.g. deleveraging and removing the moral hazard of implicit guarantees for local SOEs). The market is now poised to further differentiate credits and improve pricing, which are positive signs for investors.

This challenges investors to rethink traditional portfolio construction and uncover new ways to optimize flexibility. We see the diversity of real asset tools as an underutilized advantage that will be key to outperformance going forward. Leveraging diversity In much of the world, a powerful economic restart is officially underway. However, dislocations will likely continue as global markets forge ahead in a multi-speed, regionalized recovery. These dynamics present both challenges and opportunities for real asset investors around how to identify secular growth themes, capitalize on structural trends and build resilience while aligning with long-term investment objectives. It’s our view that expanding the traditional real asset toolkit will be key to successfully navigating these complexities and generating more meaningful alpha. By assessing the wide range of real asset options—from debt and equity to listed, primary, secondary and direct access—investors can exploit the dichotomy between stable core, value-add and opportunistic assets to customize portfolios in line with their particular investment objectives. Each asset class, we believe, plays a role in both portfolio construction and the specific type of exposure it offers to broader investment themes. Whether an investor is looking to pursue higher income portfolios with cash flow generating assets, take on more construction or contractual risk with higher capital gain potential, or some combination of both, the versatility of real asset strategies is a particularly attractive characteristic in a post-pandemic marketplace.

       "  'content': ' Accelerating evolution Investing in today’s credit markets is a quest for yield in a rapidly changing landscape. Spreads in liquid markets are at historic tights amid unprecedented central bank support for corporate credit. Industries and business models face disruption from digitization, deglobalization and decarbonization. Sustainability is increasingly important, but not always easy to achieve or measure. The deepening of private credit and the growth of SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) signal shifts in the symbiosis of public and private markets. The years following the global financial crisis were transformative ones for today’s credit markets. We think the years ahead will prove equally consequential, as some trends from the prior period speed up and newer trends take hold. Global growth: the sequel Global high yield issuance was a record US$222 billion in the first quarter of 2021, according to BlackRock Capital Markets, on a path to surpass 2020’s record-breaking tally of US$617 billion.1 Private credit is also seeing a major influx of capital, with AUM of US$975 billion as of September 2020, according to Preqin.2 This continues the expansion of the post-GFC years, which was significant but far more gradual. Looking ahead, the highest growth rates are likely to be in all types of credit outside the US and within private credit globally. This would continue the trends of the past decade—notably, markets stepping in to lend as banks pull back for regulatory reasons. But there are some key, post-pandemic differences. The leading country in the future global expansion is sure to be China, where relying less on banks and more on markets is a policy priority and the market is potentially as large as North America’s and Europe’s combined. As for private credit, 2020 was a stress test for this still-young asset class, and it passed comfortably. The potential for resilience as well as a yield pickup over traded credit are likely to enhance its appeal to investors. Significant expansion Global high yield issuance (left) and private credit demand (right) Sources: BlackRock Capital Markets, March 2021; Preqin, September 2020. Financing change The pandemic has sorted companies into haves and have-nots, depending on their industry, size and business model. We look for credit markets to serve the entire spectrum. Central bank support has prevented the wave of defaults many expected lockdowns would generate. In April Fitch Ratings lowered its leveraged loan default rate forecast for 2021 to 2.5%, far below the 14% rate seen in 2009.3 However, Fitch also forecast a slightly higher rate of up to 3.5% in 2022, and this is significant.4 For every company that actually defaults, many more face operational or balance sheet problems that are significant but solvable. Looking ahead we expect to see many companies in the latter category, even amid economic growth and easy financial conditions. Often, the reason will be some combination of leverage and a need to adapt to one or more of the powerful changes the pandemic has accelerated. A retailer needing to build out e-tailing capacity or a manufacturer re-engineering its supply chain are cases in point. Credit, particularly private credit, plays a growing role in financing this type of transformation. Meanwhile, amid growing economic optimism, credit markets are ramping up their traditional role of financing M&A, as indicated in the chart below, which shows private middle market loans used for the purpose. Acquisitions accelerate Quarterly middle-market sponsored M&A issuance Source: Refinitiv, March 2021. Innovation and integration As credit markets expanded over the past decade, the different segments focused on different kinds of issuers. High yield became a market serving larger companies able to meet the standards of an investor base that has grown more institutional over time. Smaller issuers with more complex stories increasingly looked to the private credit markets for financing. In today’s growing economy, there is a widening gap between commercial bank financing at one end of the spectrum and the syndicated leverage finance market at the other, providing further opportunities for private credit. And while this trend started in the US, it is now accelerating in Europe and Asia. Where segmentation of the overall market was a theme in the last decade, we expect integration to be a hallmark of the next one. As private debt managers have attracted more capital, direct lenders have taken on increasingly large transactions, with Preqin counting six deals over US$1 billion in 2020.5 Given the available scale, some issuers that could access syndicated markets are opting for private debt (paying a premium for certainty of execution and/or discretion) or using both. We also see mutual benefits for companies and capital providers in a life-cycle approach to credit provision. Companies needing a venture loan to fund growth, or a bespoke solution to a financing challenge, will (if all goes well) often go on to tap liquid markets. Conversely, a high yield issuer with a financing challenge may turn to private markets for a solution. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Overview A single narrative has come to dominate the market outlook. It holds that the combination of vaccine distribution, government stimulus and pent-up demand will power a burst of economic growth later this year, potentially boosting inflation and broadening corporate profit growth. Markets have rallied strongly on this belief. Investors may assume that this narrative applies globally—but that assumption is flawed. Country-by-country analysis of emerging markets makes clear that on the whole they have experienced Covid-19 very differently than developed markets, and that the experiences of individual countries within the EM complex have varied widely. Particular countries’ distinct situations lead to divergent outlooks for capital markets around the globe. This environment demands thorough understanding of each market’s individual situation and dynamics. Covid hit the developed world hardest Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, conventional wisdom expected the disease to be far more destructive in emerging markets than developed markets. That forecast was wrong. “While the coronavirus has been painful in poor and middle-income countries, it’s been significantly less painful than we would have expected,” notes Belinda Boa, BlackRock’s Head of Active Investments for Asia-Pacific and CIO of Emerging Markets in BlackRock’s Fundamental Active Equity Business. Certain EM countries kept infection rates low by implementing strong track-and-trace systems and/or quickly closing borders—particularly China, Korea and Taiwan, which make up two-thirds of EM market capitalization.1 The three countries had just 36,467 confirmed new cases of Covid-19 during the first 68 days of 2021, compared to 8.88 million for the United States2. Overall, developed markets had roughly five million more confirmed cases than emerging markets through late February3, despite much smaller total populations. But the more surprising and consequential difference is an enormous gap in mortality rates, which are far lower in the emerging world (see the chart below)—even among countries with severe outbreaks, such as India and Indonesia. Research suggests the discrepancy can’t be explained away as a product of better reporting in developed countries4. Why have poorer countries withstood the pandemic so much better than their wealthy counterparts? Researchers aren’t sure, but the explanation could lie in a combination of factors such as demographics, climate, lower comorbidities and experience with previous outbreaks. Covid mortality much lower in emerging markets Source: Johns Hopkins Uni CSSE and BlackRock, February 22, 2021. Many pandemic endgames Vaccines look likely to end the pandemic in the developed world this year. That isn’t the case in many emerging markets, which have less access to vaccines—particularly those most effective against new strains—and less infrastructure to roll them out. All of the willing US population is likely to be vaccinated by year-end 2021, compared to 34% in the EU and just 11% in emerging markets5. At the same time, political and economic considerations may prevent the imposition of additional lockdowns in many countries. Cumulative COVID-19 vaccination doses administered per 100 people Source: Official data collected by Our World in Data - Last updated March 10, 2021. EM countries could have a range of Covid endgames. Some may be able to inoculate their way out of the pandemic; many others may need to allow the virus to spread in order to reach herd immunity. In emerging markets broadly, the coronavirus could continue to interfere with life for additional months or years—but the degree will vary considerably from country to country. “I think we will see very diverse results across the emerging-markets complex both in terms of the efficacy of the rollout and the speed with which it happens,” says Boa. Investment implications Emerging and developed markets alike seem to be priced for an end to the pandemic later this year. We believe that approach is warranted in certain emerging markets but may not be in others. We believe the EM countries that were first to experience second waves and new variants are closest to the end of the pandemic. These include South Africa, where the seven-day average of confirmed new cases fell from 321 per million people in early January to fewer than 19 as of March 9, despite the emergence of more-contagious strains6. We expect similar developments in Brazil, where new cases per million people currently are roughly the same as South Africa’s were at its peak7. In our view, investors in other countries may be too complacent about the risk that new waves of Covid could restrict economic activity. For example, asset prices in India suggest investors think the country has reached herd immunity. We believe that might not be the case. If the country does not have herd immunity, it faces the possibility of a second wave that could destabilize its markets in the short term. Likewise, China has led the global recovery to this point. It was the only major economy with positive 2020 GDP growth8, and has seen key economic indicators recover to pre-Covid levels9. Risks remain, however. The country’s low rate of infection may have limited the development of natural immunity to the coronavirus generally and to new variants in particular. Meanwhile, China has been exporting vaccines rather than deploying them within its own population. Although this practice may be changing, as of the end of February the country had inoculated only 3.65% of its people with at least a single vaccine dose, compared to nearly 23% for the United States10. Although China may benefit from a global economic recovery, its sensitivity to a second wave could prevent the country from fully reopening its borders until 2022. Individual countries’ situations are evolving rapidly. Investors need to understand the Covid trajectory in each and be prepared to adapt. Thorough research in each market is essential for investors to understand the different experiences and outlooks around the world, and to allocate portfolios accordingly. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Overview To holistically support an impact enterprise’s enduring success, we believe impact investing in public equities should be built on three interconnected pillars: additionality through the investor’s contribution; additionality through the investee (the company); and additionality through the asset class. Definition of impact investing Impact investments are investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return. The practice of impact investing is further defined by core characteristics: intentionality; use of evidence and impact data in investment design; management of impact performance; contribution to the growth of the industry. Contribution from the investor Impact investors, with their natural long-term horizon, can afford an impact company the benefit of focusing on its long-term goals. Additionally, impact investors offer a more responsible exit from private investment for impact companies through patient capital and a long-term partnership. Furthermore, investors can create impact by participating in capital raises which provide additionality to the impact company. Finally, investors can engage with companies on impact progress, and increase attention to often overlooked impact enterprises. Contribution from the company A business qualifies as impact only if it meets the criteria of materiality and additionality. We typically define materiality as having greater than 50% of a company’s revenues from products and services helping to solve a major social or environmental problem. To meet the additionality criterion, a company’s products or services must address a need that is unlikely to be fulfilled by others (such as competitors or governments). Contribution at the asset class level Quite simply, the global need for impact capital is an order of magnitude greater than what could conceivably be provided by the private markets. For developing markets alone, we face a shortfall of approximately US$2.5 trillion annually to meet the SDGs by 2030.1 Given the magnitude of the need and the extraordinary opportunity, we must find ways for public markets to scale impact investing with integrity. By offering impact investing through public equities, a broad new cohort of investors can participate and provide much needed capital. '},\n",

In this “new normal” of working, shopping, and socializing from home, the digital infrastructure undergirding online workstreams, video conferencing, and cloud-based platforms has created a significant opportunity for the technology sector to continue its decades-long outperformance over broad global equity markets.

       "  'content': ' More than meets the eye Just over a year into the pandemic, market conditions and credit valuations have improved significantly. A 20% selloff as lockdowns began soon reversed and credit markets have gone on to rally over 34% since the low point in March 2020, based on the Bloomberg Barclays US High Yield Index. Roughly US$ 4 trillion of global corporate debt was issued in 2020, per BlackRock Capital Markets, and private debt funds closed on US $118 billion during 2020, according to Preqin. Behind the headline numbers, however, a more complex story is unfolding as long-running market trends intersect with Covid’s economic consequences. In the decade before the crisis, the segments of the credit markets—private, public, high yield, investment grade—grew deeper and more specialized as well as more integrated. Issuers could increasingly seek out capital on terms aligned with their needs, while investors gained more choices in risk and return profiles. Now the pandemic’s uneven impact across industries is creating a greater demand for non-traditional forms of financing on the private side of the spectrum. Beyond dispersion As the chart below reminds us, there has been a sharp dispersion between industry sectors hit hardest by Covid and those benefiting from it. For some companies, the parts of the credit spectrum available to them have changed, or the terms and prices in familiar segments have grown less attractive. Companies in leisure and travel have done sizable high-yield issues, but at generous spreads. Meanwhile, some issuers that could access the traded markets may opt instead for the scale and flexibility of the capital now available from direct lenders in private markets, or tap both public and private markets at the same time. Growth companies can continue to take advantage of private debt financing to stay private for longer. And companies facing turnaround situations or other complex challenges can partner with a specialized credit provider on a bespoke solution. An uneven recovery Returns for leveraged loans across industry sectors Source: S&P LCD and BlackRock as of 28 February 2021. The figures shown relate to past performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Future credit needs While credit markets will likely see a robust economy and strong demand from yield-hungry investors, some issuers may still face challenges. A recovery that is V-shaped for some could be L-shaped for those in sectors hit hardest by the pandemic. Additional hurdles may include the need to redesign and right-size business models, and to implement shorter and more resilient supply chains. Heightened leverage levels could be a constraint. Among companies in the S&P LSTA leveraged loan index, for example, leverage went from under five times earnings at year-end 2018 to more than six times at year-end 2020, according to S&P LCD. We expect plenty of activity across the credit spectrum this year, with private markets taking on a growing number of complex financing challenges. Original work, industry knowledge—and partnership To invest well in one part of the credit spectrum, we believe it’s important to be active in all of them. For one thing, companies tap different parts of the market as they evolve. Today’s direct lending borrower may be tomorrow’s high-yield issuer, and yesterday’s high-yield issuer may be tomorrow’s bespoke-solution seeker, looking to repair the damage inflicted by the pandemic. Knowing the industries and the companies that comprise them, and interacting with the companies over time and changing circumstances, builds confidence and trust. The more bespoke the credit, the deeper the company-level due diligence needs to be, and the more important it is to reflect the diligence in how the credit is structured. Complexity is an opportunity, but it requires original work and a willingness to dive deep in order to identify the diamonds in the rough. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Private market challenges With their potential to enhance returns and help mitigate risk through diversification, private assets play an increasingly important role in institutional portfolios. Maximizing their desired benefits can be a challenge, however, as illiquidity, opaque valuations, limited data and implementation hurdles make portfolio construction harder than it is with public-market assets. We have developed a framework that addresses these complexities through a three-step process. Potential benefits As in the public markets, private asset classes have varied in performance and attractiveness over time (see the table below). This creates an opportunity to improve portfolio outcomes with active allocation decisions across the various private market strategies. Establishing a framework to determine the right strategic asset allocation enables investors to combine portfolio outcomes, risk tolerances and constraints in a cohesive and structured process.

Download full report The human touch Unlike traditional marketable securities, private asset classes typically require specialized modeling techniques and carefully curated data. Importantly, any quantitative approach to modeling should be tempered by the judgment of an experienced private market investor. We therefore take a “quantamental” approach, wherein an experienced private markets investor helps determine the validity of cash flows generated from our model. What’s next Our improved portfolio optimization methodology, combined with careful development of a forecasting model and cash flow simulation, brings quantitative portfolio construction techniques to the private markets. It can also be extended to additional dimensions of allocation planning. Future applications could include adding granularity around region, industry sector and investment type. They could also include scenario analysis for portfolios, and analysis of portfolios that contain both private and public assets. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' We saw yet another local high in 10-year Treasury yields last week, briefly touching above 1.60% intraday Thursday after a weak 7-year auction led to an immediate 10+ basis point selloff. This was the new largest single-day selloff since mid-March 2020, and even with a modest reversal, the 10-year and 30-year yield levels stand near their highest in the past 12 months.1 Fed officials have so far not deviated from their stated comfort level regarding the move higher in yields, with Fed president Bostic reiterating the message even after the auction results.2 Corporate pension response Last week saw elevated inbound inquiry and flow into long duration assets as rising rates catalyzed substantial funded ratio improvements; as seen in the chart below, by our estimates a typical plan’s funded status may have now increased approximately 3% year-to-date as of 2/26/21, and approximately 8% since the start of the fourth quarter 2020. Estimated U.S. pension funded pension status ratio vs 30 year U.S. treasury yield Source: BlackRock, BofA Merrill Lynch. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Time series starting on 12/31/2018. Estimated Pension Funded Status is based on the average asset allocation of the US corporate defined benefit plans for which Pensions & Investments includes an asset allocation breakdown as of 9/30/2018. This asset allocation is as follows: 47.0% weight to Barclays Long Government/Credit Bond Index, 21.0% weight to Russell 1000 Index, 12.0% weight to MSCI World ex US Index, 5.0% weight to MSCI ACWI Index, 6.0% weight to S&P Listed Private Equity Index, 5.0% weight to Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index, 2.0% weight to Barclays 1-3 Month T-Bill Index. Based on the aforementioned indices, YTD as of 2/26/2021, the assets have returned -2.15%, and the liabilities have returned -5.18% resulting in a funded ratio increase of 2.82%. Based on the aforementioned indices, as of 9/30/2020, the assets have returned 5.95% and the liabilities have returned -3.33%, resulting in a funded ratio increase of 7.97%. No allowance has been made for active management or costs. Asset returns are based on the historical levels of the aforementioned modelled indices. Liability returns are based on the historical levels of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Mature US Pension Plan AAA-A Index. The assumed funded ratio is sourced from the Milliman Corporate Funding Study on the 100 largest US corporate defined benefit pension plan sponsors as of 12/31/2020. Flows found their way into government and credit sectors, the following is our views and analysis based on BlackRock clients: Plans that have been historically light on credit have added in order to meet new capital and/or spread hedge ratio targets at new glide path steps, sourcing from both return-seeking assets as well as existing government holdings. Plans with dollar-for-dollar liability matched portfolios, generally allocated pro-rata into duration-neutral credit and government holdings. Plans with higher rate hedge ratio targets and/or key-rate matching needs utilized capital efficient rate derivatives. Where do things go from here? We saw support at the long-end of the Treasury curve amidst last Thursday’s selloff. Last week, the back-end of the Treasury curve outperformed the short-end as we believe investors sought to satisfy pent up de-risking needs.3 Insurance buyers were also active this week, likely taking advantage of higher yields. We suspect this long-end institutional demand will persist over the near term. Nuances in supply and demand, liquidity and transaction costs have been increasingly prevalent in Treasury and credit markets. Prior to trading, we encourage discussion, where possible, with a BlackRock relationship manager to evaluate market opportunities and de-risking considerations. We believe the question on many investors’ minds right now is if and when the Fed will step in to provide further market support. While a possibility, we believe the rise in rates would have to begin to constrain the flow of credit to the real economy, which it does not appear to have. As we will discuss in more detail in our soon to be released Corporate Pension Themes, even in the face of rising rates, gains in funded status should continue to support allocations to long duration assets.

       "  'content': ' 2021 healthcare review The global healthcare sector (represented by the Russell 3000 HealthCare Index) returned +19.8% in 2021, highlighting positive growth in the context of a volatile equity market. However, not all industries and companies were created equal. This year brought significantly higher dispersion of returns between various industries, as well as different market capitalization segments, with the clear winners being COVID-19 beneficiaries. Overall, areas more sensitive to impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, including medtech elective procedures, next generation service providers and telemedicine companies experienced heightened volatility and weaker returns during the period. In addition, broad market uncertainty led to a flight to safety away from risky assets and in favor of large, quality companies. Healthcare companies with market caps below $10billion delivered on average negative returns in 2021. Life sciences companies, primarily providing technological tools and software for increased efficiency as well as research services, were strong winners during the year. The industry benefited from increased technological adoption and heightened demand for clinical services. In the healthcare providers space, hospitals and lab testing companies experienced strong returns, largely due to increased demand as a result of COVID-19. The managed care industry, primarily composed of large, U.S.-based insurance providers, experienced positive momentum on the back of the quality and value factor market rotation. Elsewhere in the industry, home health companies and value-based primary care providers experienced significant drawdowns during the year. The companies were negatively impacted by increased COVID-related costs, lower than anticipated adoption and the growth-to-value rotation that affected many 2020 strong stock performers. Returns within the pharmaceuticals sector were strong but concentrated, with three companies, Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson, driving about 91% of the returns this year in the Russell 3000 HealthCare Index. Both Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson benefited from the FDA emergency approval and subsequent deployment of their COVID-19 vaccines. Eli Lilly soared on the strength of their COVID-19 antibody treatment as well as an anticipated upcoming approval of their Alzheimer’s drug. The medical devices and supplies space also experienced heightened dispersion during the year, with COVID-19 diagnostic and testing companies posting the strongest returns. Results amongst the elective procedure segment were largely mixed, with larger, diversified quality companies delivering solid growth. Companies developing hospital tools, medical supplies and remote monitoring devices also returned positively. The biotechnology industry experienced the greatest weakness during 2021, with the equal weighted S&P Select Biotechnology Index posting -20% returns. The industry experienced a sharp reversal from 2020 highs, likely driven by factor rotations in the market, as well as lackluster clinical progress outside of COVID-19 during the period. Stripping out COVID-19 vaccine developer Moderna, which returned a staggering 143% in 2021, left the industry with approximately flat returns during the period. A slowdown in M&A activity amidst increased regulatory scrutiny and clinical safety setbacks in areas like gene therapy have also contributed to dampening sentiment. Given the riskier characteristics of early stage biotechnology companies, market sentiment shifted out of favor for the industry, even in cases of positive clinical development. Overall, 2021 brought increased dispersion and volatility across the healthcare sector, creating pockets of opportunity for 2022. 2021 healthcare returns by industry weight & market cap Source: FactSet as of December 31st, 2021. Sub-sectors are constituents of the Russell 3000 HealthCare Index. 2022 outlook mRNA vaccines Vaccines that target the spike protein found on the novel coronavirus using genetically engineered mRNA were a new class of inoculations approved during 2021. These jabs, primarily developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, saw high efficacy rates and wide adoption in the U.S. and across the developed world. Praised not only for their impressive results but also for the velocity of development, scientists are looking to use the mRNA modality to approach infectious diseases in the future, including malaria, influenza, sexually-transmitted diseases and cancer. mRNA therapies are likely to see continued clinical development in oncology over the next few years, as scientists attempt to leverage the modality of training the human immune system to fight specific identifiers in order to target tumor and cancerous cells. The versatility of genetically engineered mRNA is likely to usher in a new wave of medical innovation over the next decade. Diagnostics In March 2020, the FDA granted emergency approval to the first ever CRISPR-applied product, a COVID-19 diagnostic test that revealed results in under an hour. A year later, dozens of different diagnostic solutions have been developed by leading medtech companies, among them Abbott Labs, Danaher, Becton Dickinson and Thermo Fisher. From 10-minute blood tests to at-home rapid antigen swabs, testing companies have continued to innovate in 2021, in order to provide increasingly efficient and accurate COVID-19 tests. We anticipate that demand for COVID-19 diagnostic tests is likely to persist in the near-term on the back of the emergence of new virus variants. Antiviral oral treatments The second half of 2021 brought a welcome advance in the fight against the pandemic: the development of efficacious antiviral oral treatments for COVID-19. First announced by Merck & Co and subsequently launched by Pfizer, these treatments have the potential to significantly reduce mortality in patients sick with the virus, helping prevent severe illness and keeping hospitalizations at a manageable rate. Originally developed in the early 2000’s to treat influenza, Merck’s molnupivarir faced regulatory scrutiny after announcing that the drug was not as efficacious as originally expected. In contrast, Pfizer’s Paxlovid, a protease inhibitor drug, was found to reduce the risk of hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients by 89%. Despite the incessant focus of the healthcare industry on addressing COVID-19, there is also significant scientific progress outside of the current pandemic. Oncology The field of cancer treatments continued to expand at a rapid pace in 2021, despite record low rates of utilization. Patient hesitation to visit hospitals during the pandemic has led to significantly lower rates of diagnoses, with early 2021 rates still 26-51% below pre-pandemic levels. The impact of these delayed detections will likely continue to play out in the years to come. From a development perspective, breakthroughs in immune modulation are leading to record-levels of efficacy, with 17 novel cancer treatments approved for use globally in 2020 (16 of these designated as orphan drugs for rare cancers). Innovative treatments continue to be concentrated in smaller-capped companies, with nearly 80% of early-stage pipelines and 66% of late-stage pipelines being developed by emerging biopharma companies.1 CAR T-Cell therapies, a revolutionary oncotherapy, continued to expand in 2021, with approved treatments currently targeting lymphoma and leukemia now becoming increasingly accessible in the U.S.. Alzheimer’s 2021 marked a milestone in the fight against Alzheimer’s with the FDA approval of Biogen and Eisai’s drug Aduhelm earlier this year. The drug and other biosimilars continue a controversial and volatile road ahead faced with regulatory scrutiny and hurdles in commercial adoption. Medtech Medical devices continue to see significant progress, with advancements ranging from portable MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machines, ACL (anterior cruciate ligament)-healing tools and Alzheimer’s blood-based diagnostics, among others. We are likely to see continued innovation in this space, from precision surgical tools and minimally-invasive procedures, to the growing trend of wearable tech and connected devices, like continuous glucose monitoring systems. Technology in healthcare Despite the innovation developed within the sector, there is still a long way to go in the use of technology to improve products and services. In particular, the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical trials, gene mapping and robotic-assisted surgery is increasing. We are also seeing AI and software innovations in electronic records, personalized insurance plans and next-gen healthcare provider services. Early adopters of AI tools in clinical development have cited the ability of machine learning algorithms to identify biomarkers and learn about new diseases 30% faster than human pathologists. Given the average go-to-market rate of 5-10 years for new drugs, experts are hopeful that technology like AI can speed up drug discovery and development. 2 1IQVIA Institute: Global Oncology Trends, June 2021 2 BioSpace, December 2021 Reference to the names of the companies mentioned is for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice or an investment recommendation of the companies. Despite dampening sentiment on China investments in 2021, we continue to view the country as a long-term growth opportunity in healthcare, particularly as the government invests in the development of an innovative domestic biopharma industry. On the back of continued regulatory uncertainty, we remain neutral on sentiment in the country today, with a preference in risk-managed opportunities, such as contract research organizations, that benefit from secular demand for clinical trials and services, which we believe are likely to see organic growth in the next few years. We maintain exposure to biopharma companies in select, high-conviction opportunities. Valuations today for the healthcare sector remain very attractive and well below the long-run average, with FY1 P/E ratios currently at a 20% discount to broad equity markets (represented by the Russell 3000 Index). Certain industries, such as biotechnology, appear particularly attractive, with a FY1 P/E discount of 51% versus broad equity markets. We remain selectively optimistic in this industry, particularly in the small- and mid-cap segment of the market, with a focus on innovative pipelines and strong product results.

       "  'content': ' View through the prism of our investment process Emerging market (EM) equities defied early gloom last year and ended with double -digit gains, outperforming developed markets1. The 2020 total return for the MSCI EM Index, 18.3% in U.S. dollars, reflected strong global fiscal and monetary supports, China’s economic rebound, vaccines signaling gradual improvements ahead and some optimism about an earnings recovery in EM. Download quarterly newsletter Market overview and outlook We are constructive on EM equities for several reasons: 1. Strong liquidity, easy financial conditions and high levels of disposable income underpin expectations for positive earnings growth (see chart below); 2. Covid-19 vaccines support the gradual resumption of normal economic activity; 3. the pandemic-related stimuli have been proportionally less taxing across most developing nations relative to developed peers; 4. the weaker U.S. dollar has helped EM economies attract foreign capital; and 5. recent flows into EM equities reinforce this view, which we see extending in 2021. Three signposts to watch Recovery. Large economies following China’s path can help lift the global economy. Market breadth. “Momentum” stocks that drove equity returns last year (high tech and healthcare) may lose appeal reflecting a shift in valuations and earnings expectations. Geopolitics.

Download quarterly newsletter Focusing on what matters Covid-19 ushered in a new decade for the world and will be remembered for its disruption to lives and livelihoods, globally. But this pandemic should further be remembered for fast-tracking trends already underway in social attitudes towards working and learning (more remote access), spending (more online shopping/services) and investing (more emphasis on environmental, social and governance, ESG, issues). We believe these trends are here to stay and remain at the forefront of our minds as we apply the investment tools we’ve developed to help navigate current and future market environments. Last year’s volatility complicated equity investing, but other extremes required equally astute judgments. For example, the dichotomies between an expectation that emerging economies would be hardest hit versus the actual outcome, or the bifurcation of sector performance that benefited a limited group –growth-oriented, internet-related or new technology stocks –to the detriment of more established and visible sectors. These challenges enabled us to test our focus on data sciences, risk management and market composition as ways to refine our investment decision-making. We touch on each to illustrate how they played out last year, and why these areas will remain integral to our investment process. Data mining Popular belief suggested that Covid-19 should have hit developing economies disproportionally hard, but our data scientists monitoring the situation evidenced facts pointing in the opposite direction. Fatalities in developed countries, mostly in the western hemisphere, outpaced those in developing ones by about four times between March and September 2020, based on counts per one million people. What contributed to this relatively controlled outcome? China, South Korea and Taiwan became world champions at finding, testing and isolating people effectively. Many EM countries went for herd immunity strategies by default, with large populations contracting the virus, and have generally fared better than many developed countries despite having inferior healthcare systems. Our stock-picking methodology, based on analysing company fundamentals, has increasingly relied on data scientists within our team to corroborate or reject our investment theses. We’ll continue to adhere to this practice and enhance it over time. Download quarterly newsletter Risk management The momentum style dominated stock returns last year, with high tech and healthcare driving most indexes’ performance –see A widening gap graph. But stock prices can’t go up forever, and vaccines and the end of lockdowns will lead to normalcy and may expose certain valuation anomalies. To balance portfolio risk, we turned to our dedicated EM equity experts in BlackRock’s Risk and Quantitative Analysis group to understand risk exposures and identify what we considered an appropriate mix in seeking to add alpha over this turbulent year. We’ve held growth and momentum stocks while progressively shifting to sectors that should benefit from normalization: the unloved financials and leisure-related stocks that have drawn our attention lately due to low valuations and improved earnings prospects. In an increasingly sophisticated world, we regard the close relationship with our risk management experts as critical to understanding portfolio risks and cementing our foremost ambition of creating a sustained alpha for our clients.

The figures shown relate to past performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. Download quarterly newsletter Market composition The face of EM has changed dramatically since the 2008 global financial crisis, and more changes are brewing. China has effectively controlled the virus and managed a challenging period for its economy. Its share of world exports rose to about 14% last year, a new high thanks to global spending in technology and Covid-related protective equipment. But domestic consumption has risen steadily and played a large role in last year’s V-shaped recovery, adding more than 50% of China’s GDP and up from 2019 levels. Another salient change is the rise of internet giants that have drastically reshaped index composition and size. The changing face of EM graph compares the top 10 MSCI EM Index constituents recently and in late 2008. Alibaba, today’s largest, and Tencent, second largest in the index, were not even in the picture back then, and only two have remained in the top 10 —TSMC (Taiwan) and Samsung Electronics (South Korea). This fast-moving scene brings new challenges about index risks and concentration, but also potential opportunities. China’s rise as an investment destination seems inevitable, yet we don’t see any single country monopolizing performance and have continued to identify potentially rewarding opportunities in India, Mexico and elsewhere in EM. The internet giants are also facing headwinds from increasing regulatory pressures and more intense competition, which undermine their potential to keep growing at the same breakneck pace. Our focus on generating unique investment insight, aided by our data scientists and risk management experts will remain vital inputs for our decision-making.

Portfolio positioning Industrial activity and discretionary consumer demand led China’s V-shaped economic recovery, and we believe the trajectory will remain healthy. However, the central bank has started tightening monetary policy, and the strong performance in the onshore and offshore equity markets suggest this is a time to be quite selective. We believe India’s economy will continue to recover and have a positive view on ASEAN countries –especially Indonesia, where we see an attractive entry point given the premium growth and yield this country can offer. In Latin America, we maintain our preference for Mexico over Brazil, although we have started to reduce our under-exposure to Brazil, which we consider a good source for cyclical exposures, with attractive valuations and very low ownership as incentives. Markets in EMEA remain interesting, as they should benefit from the large European fiscal stimulus directed primarily at infrastructure spending. This is feeding into significant stimulus in Eastern Europe, for the first time in years. In short, we believe global investors have an opportunity to expand into EM equities at good entry point given the attractive growth and yield relative to DMs, at a time valuations and ownership remain low.

       "  'abstract': 'An integrated view of private markets has never been more important. Explore highlights from our start-of-the-year webcast, with investors looking at deployment, investment themes and possible surprises in real assets, credit and private equity.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Investors making long-term decisions in illiquid markets have much to consider as they begin 2021. Covid is intersecting with deep shifts in the economy and society, driving changes that span asset classes and reach well into the future. We believe an integrated view of private markets is especially important now, and in early January we convened investors from across our platform to compare their outlooks in a webcast. Following is a summary of the discussion between Jim Barry, CIO of BlackRock Alternative Investors (BAI) and Global Head of Real Assets; James Keenan, CIO and Global Co-head of Credit; Nathalie von Niederhaeusern, Head of EMEA for Private Equity Partners; and Mark Everitt, Head of Investment Research and Strategy for BlackRock Alternative Investors. How we begin the year We have seen a major rebound from the first quarter trauma of 2020, in new investment opportunities as well as deployment and valuation levels. Improvements in the underlying economy are feeding through into the financials of many underlying assets. We are also seeing increased competition for investments, placing pressure on returns, though these are still at attractive levels. Competition also means less time to close deals and makes it important to have the investment expertise, relationships and legal resources to move quickly. Of the multiple trends accelerated by the pandemic, two in particular stand out: digitization and decarbonization, with the latter also helping to increase the focus on environmental, governance and social (ESG) standards more broadly. The path of the pandemic itself remains a major focus, as positive news about vaccines vies with negative news about infection rates, shutdowns and challenges in vaccinating populations at scale. Digging into deployment High levels of dry powder in private asset classes put a spotlight on deployment rates. We expect the opportunity set to remain robust. Our sourcing funnel finished 2020 at around 90% of 2019 levels—noteworthy given the slowdown earlier in the year—and the momentum continues. In early December we asked a group of our senior investors in BAI what they expect their deployment levels to be in 2021. Over 80% of said they expect deployment to be the same or higher than forecasted pre-Covid. In private credit, for example, we expect to see more opportunities in restructuring and distressed situations, as the effects of shutdowns and structural shifts catch up with more companies. We also expect to see broader private credit markets continue to grow, as more companies (including some with access to public markets) seek the scale and flexibility of the capital now available from direct lenders. Deconstructing digitization The shift of activity into the virtual world is among the pandemic’s most profound effects. Even amid competition we continue to find private equity and credit opportunities in cloud computing companies (to name one example), in part by applying a sharper focus to business models and growth prospects. In real estate, we believe the burgeoning e-commerce market will continue to make the industrial logistics space a favorite. For our part, we are focused on last-mile distribution facilities, where high occupancies and rent growth may benefit logistics landlords. We see location as the main return driver—more so than property quality. In the US, for example, we like properties in the high-barrier and high-income coastal regions, such as Los Angeles and Northern New Jersey/New York. In infrastructure, meanwhile, data centers are evolving as an asset class. We see value in assets servicing large corporate counterparties on a contracted basis. We seek to mitigate risk by targeting data centers able to serve a diverse customer base within the more robust industry sectors, such as life sciences or business services. Recovery plays We have seen a broadening of deal types as economic uncertainty lessened in the second half of 2020, and we think this will continue. In real assets we expect investors to look beyond the sectors with Covid tailwinds to take advantage of cyclical recovery in sectors where valuations may have become overly pessimistic—for example, in regional airports. In credit, our private direct lending teams saw a shift from companies seeking liquidity buffers early in the crisis to companies funding growth into the recovery. This year we expect an increase in acquisition activity to boost demand for direct lending. In private equity last year, activity was concentrated in add-on acquisitions for portfolio companies, which are perceived to be a less risky strategy and accounted for more than 50% of transactions globally, according to Burgiss. This year we expect more interest in new platform companies, with ongoing appetite for exposure to sectors such as technology and healthcare contributing to the trend. An example is the recent acquisition of a private hospital chain in Europe. The attractive valuation reflected the stresses of the pandemic, and the sector is seen as needing consolidation to help smaller hospitals benefit from economies of scale. Downside risks and upside surprises Every outlook needs to look beyond base cases. On the downside, we are alert to: Setbacks in vaccine deployment and fighting the pandemic. Worse than expected damage from structural shifts—for example, in on-street retail or energy. The bill for stimulus, whether in higher taxes, inflation or both. Upside surprises on our radar include: Pent-up demand proves even greater than expected, and impaired sectors come back stronger. Unexpected momentum from uptake of 5G wireless. Major boost from robust US stimulus and public investment. In the US, we expect the policies of the incoming Biden administration to have significant effects on markets. In particular, we think an ambitious green agenda could significantly accelerate the global decarbonization trend, with consequences not just in energy, but in everything from real estate to manufacturing supply chains and beyond.

Lessons of 2020 Full year results across global credit markets last year masked the most significant and highly correlated selloff in recent history, followed by an impressive rebound from the March lows.

Selectivity will be key Credit is supported by expectations for continued accommodative policies, vaccine development and deployment, an improving consumer and corporate sector, and a multi-year earnings recovery. However, spreads are near historic lows, and some deteriorating terms and transaction quality reinforce our increased focus on credit selection. What we expect We expect credit markets generally to deliver mid-single digit returns this year driven primarily by coupon income (carry) with spread tightening offset by modestly steeper yield curves. We believe accommodative global policy support and vaccine development and distribution will fuel pent up demand which should support an earnings recovery and lead to new investment and a multi-year expansion. Despite our overall constructive tone, investors should anticipate a wider range of outcomes across regions and sectors and focus on credit selection to create differentiated outcomes. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' As sustainability moves up the agenda, private debt funds have an important role to play in helping build a collective approach to ESG issues from institutional investor level through to portfolio company practices, says BlackRock’s Sonia Rocher. A Q&A with Sonia Rocher If environmental, social and governance issues were already on the radar of many private credit funds, their investors and portfolio companies, 2020 looks set to be the year that accelerates the integration of sustainable investment and business practices. But what does ESG integration mean in the context of private debt? And how much leverage does a lender really have with management teams when it comes to encouraging sustainability? We explored these and other issues with Sonia Rocher, managing director in BlackRock’s European private credit group. Why are ESG factors becoming more important for corporates seeking access to capital? We’ve seen a lot of change over the past few years as lenders and investors have been gathering data and monitoring borrowers through more of a sustainability lens. This development has been happening quite rapidly in private credit, but we’re also seeing it across the liquid credit markets, including in areas such as high-yield bonds and leveraged loans. Overall, there is a much greater awareness and understanding of how capital can be directed towards the sustainability agenda. For example, we take a long-term view on companies and why they will be winners – ESG and sustainability factors play strongly into this. As an investor, you want to be sure you are backing companies with a sustainable business model and that holds true across private credit, private equity, public equities and fixed income. That means companies increasingly need to demonstrate their ESG credentials and especially their readiness for climate transition to be successful in capital-raising.

       "  'abstract': 'BlackRock’s leading emerging market investors explain why they are bullish on EM in 2021 and where they see the best opportunities in equity and debt.',\n",
       "  'content': \" Insights from BII’s 2021 Outlook and the importance of EM In our 2021 Institutional Sentiment survey of U.S. and Canadian investors, emerging markets were viewed as the asset class offering the best opportunities in both equity and debt in 2021.1 Likewise, the BlackRock Investment Institute came out with broadly favorable views of EM in its 2021 Outlook. To help investors understand why we’re positive on emerging markets, and where we see the best opportunities, BlackRock’s Chief Client Officer Mark McCombe sat down with our leading EM investors and strategists for a broad-reaching conversation. Mark was joined by Mike Pyle, Global Chief Investment Strategist for the BlackRock Investment Institute; Jeff Shen, Co-CIO of Active Equity and Co-Head of Systematic Active Equity; Gordon Fraser, Co-Head of Global Emerging Markets Equities; and Sergio Trigo Paz, Head of Emerging Markets Fixed Income. Highlights of their discussion are below, and a full replay can be viewed here. BII’s 2021 outlook is constructive on emerging markets, and so are the respondents to our flash survey. What makes you bullish? We're looking for cyclical exposures with upside in 2021, and we think emerging markets will benefit from several tailwinds. Broadly speaking, the change in tone from the new administration in Washington should be a welcome respite from the unpredictability and volatility of the past four years. That boost in sentiment is going to be true across the board, but we believe it will be especially important for emerging markets. We also see the outlook for the U.S. dollar as supportive of EM assets. We're positive on global risk in 2021, which we think is consistent with a somewhat weaker dollar. And the narrowing of the interest rate gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world also points to a weaker dollar, which tends to be quite good for emerging assets. Regionally, when we look at emerging Asia, we see that the public health response has been extremely robust across a range of different economies, and that has left them well-positioned for the near term. Over the longer term, we think that Asia, particularly East Asia, is going to be one of the most important poles of global growth alongside the United States. How have EMs weathered the storm this year and what do you see heading into 2021? We think the Covid-led selloff that EM experienced is setting the scene for a recovery in 2021. The weaker currencies make the economies more competitive, and the capital flight we saw earlier this year has set the stage for a new cycle. We also feel that EM dealt with Covid extremely well compared to much of the developed world. In some of the North Asian countries that moved swiftly and aggressively to contain the outbreak, we’re already seeing output exceed pre-Covid levels. Even some of the countries elsewhere that didn’t impose strict lockdowns and, instead, accepted that the virus would spread, are now experiencing growth in output toward pre-Covid levels. So we think EM is set up really well for a strong cyclical recovery in 2021, and that may surprise some equity market participants. What about EM debt, what has this experience taught us and how are you positioning for next year? Two lessons that stand out this year are that EM debt is diverse and resilient. We’ve seen markets react differently because the economies and are very different—for example, some are commodity exporters and some are commodity importers. But overall the asset class has proved resilient, and part of that stems from the fact that emerging markets have had to withstand a series of crises over the years, so they are better prepared for these types of shocks. Looking ahead, the fact the U.S. has joined the zero-rate club for the foreseeable future is a real game changer. This is going to increase the pressure on U.S. pension funds, insurance companies and other institutions that need income. Given the lack of income available elsewhere, we believe the question is not whether to invest in EM debt, it’s how to invest in EM debt. We talked earlier about the outlook for a weaker U.S. dollar, and we think that points to a particularly favorable environment for local-currency-denominated debt, both sovereign and corporate. We see these as good diversifiers from the dollar, but, of course, selectivity will be key. With selectivity in mind, how are you assessing different regions, countries and industries? Given the differences in the public health and economic policy responses we’ve seen across EM, we think country selection will continue to be very important. At the sector level, the story is largely about the dichotomy between companies operating in the virtual world and those operating in the physical world. But this bifurcation between physical and virtual is also driving performance at the country level. When you put all of this together, that leads to a pretty constructive view of Asia, which has benefitted from strong policy responses and provides investors with a great deal of exposure to the technology sector. And with Asia accounting for close to 80% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, being positive on Asia translates into a positive view on emerging markets broadly. Where do you see winners and losers at the country level? We think the fiscal positions of emerging markets, in general, are in much better shape than developed markets. Unlike in developed markets, there weren’t a lot of handouts to the EM populace. And while deficits have deteriorated, that's largely because revenue lines disappointed. So it’s reasonable to expect that the dollar should weaken against emerging market currencies, at least in real terms. The countries that typically gain the most in this environment are the ones that borrow the most, because the value of their debt drops in local currency terms. The servicing cost of that debt drops, and that acts like a stimulus to the economy. That group of countries includes Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, and—perhaps to a lesser extent—India. We see tailwinds for all these countries heading into next year, and that’s already starting to come through in the earnings of the underlying companies. Some of the countries that are more challenged are those that have dollar pegs or are otherwise more linked to the dollar. For example, parts of the Middle East that don't benefit to the same extent from capital flows. Many clients are bullish on China. How do you think the U.S.-China relationship will play out and what does this mean for investors? Despite the change in the U.S. administration, the relationship will remain a competitive one. There's going to be competition on trade, technology, national security, overall economic stance, and, importantly, on ideology. We really cannot underestimate the importance of the competitive nature of the relationship. That said, we expect to see more clarity and consistency on U.S. policy regarding China, and we also expect to see greater coordination between the U.S. and other countries in dealing with China. For investors, that means that geopolitics, while still important, won’t be the dominant driver that they’ve been over the past four years. Instead, we’ll see a more diverse set of return drivers—including economic fundamentals and company-specific differentiators—and, frankly, we think investors will view that as a welcome change. Should investors access Chinese equities via a standalone exposure or as part of a broader EM allocation? There are good arguments for both approaches. China's very cyclical, and, unlike other emerging markets, it has very short, sharp cycles. That’s because the policy transmission mechanism in China is so quick and so effective. So there is a real opportunity for broad emerging market funds to add value by tactically allocating in and out of China, if they can get these cycles right. A structural argument in favor of the China-specific approach is the sheer diversity of the stock market there. The liquidity and diversity—particularly in the A-share market—is tremendous. There are roughly 2,000 liquid stocks to invest in, with a huge variety of sectors that you don't really see in other emerging markets. That gives active managers many different levers to drive returns. But one thing to be cautious of with China-only strategies is style bias—it’s something that we see a lot of in that space. What about the Chinese bond market, how are you thinking about investing there? The market is seeing increased inflows due to higher rates and investors’ search for diversifying assets. At the same time, the government has successfully managed the pandemic, so rates may not go lower and inflation could rear its head. That type of environment is more conducive to carry trades than it is to duration trades. Another interesting dynamic we’re seeing is that Chinese bonds aren’t necessarily competing with other EM debt to attract investor inflows. In fact, they’re often competing with investors’ allocations to core developed markets. That’s a reflection of both the zero-rate environment in the developed world and of how much the Chinese debt markets have grown and developed.

       "  'abstract': 'The pandemic is likely to drive a significant wave of restructuring that calls for a broader range of solutions than seen in prior cycles.',\n",
       "  'content': ' More sector-specific, and a bigger role for fresh capital Credit markets have travelled an unprecedented path this year, driven dramatically down by the Covid-19 shock and then revived by a massive policy response. Thus began a cycle that we believe is now headed for an equally unprecedented phase of distress and restructuring — similar in scale to the post-2008 default wave, but differing in important ways. For many debt issuers and their stakeholders, the period will doubtless be a difficult one. At the same time, investors prepared to navigate a different sort of cycle may find opportunities in the rebuilding ahead. Download distressed credit paper More leverage, more debt, and differing amounts of distress across sectors Growth in company leverage in U.S. leveraged finance markets (left) and sub-investment grade and private debt (right); distressed debt by sector (bottom) We anticipate three key differences between the coming cycle and the period after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). First, distressed investing after the GFC most often entailed post-default purchases of corporate debt in the secondary market. Now, after a decade of structural change in the credit markets — eroding protection for lenders as well as shifts in who holds the debt — the dynamics of restructuring are likely to change too. While the purchase of discounted claims, loans and bonds will have an ongoing role, we also see a potential need for new capital being injected directly into stressed and distressed companies. This will often mean earlier engagement with issuers and working across the capital structure with a wider array of creditors and shareholders. Second, instead of being able to rely on a broad-based economic recovery to improve value, we think investors will need to be keenly attuned to the sector-specific impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although fiscal and monetary support is cushioning some of the near-term impact, the pandemic is already driving deep economic change that benefits some industries, technologies and business models, while severely challenging others. Finally, these impacts are being felt across a credit market far larger than it was at the time of the GFC. Sub-investment grade debt has increased nearly threefold to about US$5.6 trillion today vs. about US$2 trillion in 2007. Private credit, meanwhile, has expanded to US$850 billion as of December 31, 2019 and is on pace to exceed US$1 trillion by the end of this year. Companies themselves are more highly levered. Debt levels for companies funded in the U.S. leveraged finance markets averaged above four times EBITDA at March 31, 2020, compared to under three times in 2008, and they are at the beginning of what we expect to be a challenging economic cycle: Year-over-year revenue growth for U.S. high yield companies was -15% in the second quarter of 2020. The charts above show the growth in debt outstanding and leverage levels, and how the pandemic has already created different levels of distress in different sectors across the high yield market. We expect sector dispersion to increase as the effects of economic stimulus wane and the pandemic grinds on. The amount of debt trading at distressed prices has fallen sharply amid the market rally that began in March, from over US$400 billion to around US$73 billion as of August 31, 2020, and the implied five-year cumulative default rate on CCC bonds has declined from 61% at the March highs to around 45% as of September 27, 2020. However, much of this improvement is likely to prove temporary. While a significant amount of capital has been raised in recent years to invest in distressed credit (we estimate dry powder of approximately US$130 to US$150 billion), we think it still may not be enough to meet the funding needs of this cycle. Evolution of market structure A greater strategic allocation to credit from global institutional investors has contributed to an evolving ownership profile aided by the significant expansion of investment tools like exchange traded funds. The makeup of market segments has evolved as well. Within high yield, the size of[ the average issuer has grown larger as smaller issuers have increasingly sought capital through private markets. The pandemic is driving further shifts. As in prior credit cycles, we have seen significant fallen angel downgrades (more than US$150 billion this year through August 31, 2020 according to Credit Suisse, although the pace slowed as stimulus took hold) from an investment grade market more dominated by BBBs than it has been historically. Changes in the bank loan market are likely to play an especially significant role in this credit cycle. CLOs now own nearly 60% of the loan market as investors have flocked to structured credit as a tool for investing in loans across a range of rating tranches. As the charts below highlight, while CLO ownership has grown, the loosening of covenants leaves the loan market approximately 75% covenant-lite today, while the quality of the loan market has slipped with greater single-B issuance. Although CLO structures have improved since the GFC, the combination of covenant-lite assets and structured liabilities remains a critical risk consideration for investors, and puts additional focus on the quality of the CLO managers themselves in addition to the underlying loan collateral. Bank loans: Increasingly cov-lite, increasingly held in CLOs Loan covenant quality as tracked by Moody’s (left) and growth in loans, CLOs, and CLO % of loans (right) Much has been written about the growth of covenant-lite debt, but we think the implications on corporate restructurings remain underappreciated. Greater financial flexibility for issuers may be to the detriment of debt holders, as additional senior or pari-passu debt is injected into distressed capital structures. This is likely to exacerbate the dynamic between buyers of secondary debt looking for control versus those seeking to maintain or refinance debt with better lender protections. Looser covenants may initially help issuers avoid technical default while putting more pressure on the various classes of creditors and shareholders to align on a restructuring plan that serves a wider range of constituent needs. The different composition of debt holders entering this distressed cycle is an important consideration as well. At the start of the GFC, bank proprietary trading desks and hedge funds with redemption structures were major holders and buyers of risk. Today there is more ownership diversity across a wider universe of locked-up capital from private funds, as well as closed-end funds, CLOs, and longer-term institutional investors. For issuers this is a mixed blessing. With the exception of those using the direct lending markets, risk is generally more distributed, and the funding basis of investors is more robust. At the same time, these holders have varying motivations and constraints, sometimes including the need to sell in the event of a downgrade. While in past conflicts outcomes were typically directed between different classes of debt, there may be more strife now between different types of holders — for example, par versus secondary or distress-for-control versus CLOs looking for reinstatement. Structurally diminished liquidity and potential forced de-leveraging among private investors are also important considerations today. Dealers have limited capacity to warehouse risk because of post-GFC regulatory changes, and investors may find it more difficult to construct a diversified portfolio with fewer blocks consistently on offer. Meanwhile, levered private fund investors such as Business Development Companies (BDCs) may find themselves in need of secondary liquidity in circumstances where investments experience increased leverage with a drop off in earnings that pushes funds beyond leverage limits and creates a need to sell investments to de-lever. These structural differences are likely to impact the trajectory and duration of distressed investing this cycle. The availability and growth of private credit to step in as a financing source for more complex and lower quality issuers can better align issuer needs with longer lockup capital that is capable of constructing more bespoke solutions. The composition of opportunities in public markets as a result shifts to larger and/or more established businesses in many cases. Regardless, the key will be finding alignment between the needs of the company and the breadth of priorities of its creditors. Restructuring and post-default scenarios Given the structural changes in the market, what might restructurings look like in the quarters to come? We anticipate two basic types: A continuation of the slow-motion, well known restructurings we have seen historically, and an increase in liquidity-driven defaults where companies are forced into bankruptcy due to quickly changing business conditions or the inability to come to terms with creditors. Buying distressed debt on the secondary market will continue to be an effective way to capitalize on dislocation and market inefficiency, we believe — but may often need to be done in tandem with the ability to provide fresh capital to keep companies out of insolvency or help recapitalize them to exit a bankruptcy process. We expect this cycle will require a broader investment perspective and a more comprehensive toolkit to enable engagement with companies in different stages of restructuring, from stressed-but-still-solvent all the way through bankruptcy and recovery. The list is long, and ranges from rescue financing, rights offerings, debtor-in-possession loans and exit financing to more specialized tools such as vendor financing. Market dynamics since the pandemic began have created a variety of investment opportunities. For example, convertible bond issuance has accelerated this year (more than $84b in U.S. dollar convertibles as of August 25th per Bloomberg) amid the heightened economic uncertainty and elevated volatility. By bundling an equity option with their bonds, companies have been able to issue debt with lower coupons. Should equity prices decline, however, these convertibles will trade at a steep discount to par, because “busted” converts must make up for in price what they lack in coupon, to deliver a similar all-in yield to the market. These discounts create an opening where investors and companies can work together to create “win/win” transactions via debt-for-debt-exchanges, debt-for-equity-exchanges, early buybacks and other capital structure optimization transactions. Implications of the pandemic for business models As investors consider which industries and companies to get involved with, we think it is imperative to examine each company’s business operating model in light of the changes driven by the pandemic. The stark difference in performance between airlines and technology companies or leisure and healthcare companies is just a starting point. Even in the hardest-hit sectors there will be winners — oftentimes, companies well positioned to consolidate — while sectors enjoying an overall tailwind will still have losers. Notably in the leveraged finance and private credit markets, the companies in question are often not tier 1 businesses but value chain companies (suppliers, consumers), sub-scale competitors, or startups in the early stages of growth. Companies are focusing closely now on refinancing to term out debt and lock in capital where they can, rationalizing business structures to create greater efficiency and reduce cost, and restructuring debt to align debt profile to the issuer in a post-pandemic world. The market recovery since March has disproportionally benefited higher-quality companies in sectors less directly affected by Covid-19. Low rates, and the recovery in spreads to near pre-pandemic tights leads to greater M&A activity and financial engineering. As is highlighted in the chart below, lower-quality credit has lagged in the recovery, particularly in sectors impacted significantly by Covid-19. Regardless, investors will need a well-informed view on where both the sector and the specific company are headed. In recent years, some distressed investors in the energy space have learned the hard lesson that buying cheap doesn’t matter if you can’t find an exit. We expect that lesson to be highly relevant in a post-Covid world. Headwinds for some sectors, tailwinds for others Dispersion of returns for high yield issues across industry sectors Looking ahead As mentioned above, we believe the amount of capital needed over the next couple of years exceeds the amount that has been raised to date. However, investors are moving quickly to pursue investment opportunities and we expect the market to be competitive. For example, we are seeing a number of private equity firms raise equity and credit funds to deploy into distressed opportunities either by buying the company or injecting structured equity/junior credit to help finance restructurings and turnarounds. This will be a significant pool of capital to be deployed that did not exist in past cycles. The increasing need for capital and a growing supply of investors seeking to deploy into these opportunities will require greater selectivity. Unlike traditional public market syndicated transactions where price discovery and deal comparisons are more readily available, highly bespoke and privately structured deals are less easily assessed. It is therefore critical to maximize visibility across deals while remaining highly selective about participation. In other words, see a lot to do a little. The investment opportunity for distressed investing this cycle is significant. As we highlighted, the scale of opportunities and the range of potential solutions are likely to make this cycle historically unique. The economic uncertainty, outlook for monetary and fiscal policy, and ongoing potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will have enormous consequences on corporate results, outlook and opportunities in the years ahead. As we emerge from the pandemic lockdown, we believe the distressed investment opportunity is attractive for those able to build flexible portfolios that can take advantage of a wide range of potential investment solutions. Companies are being forced to think outside the box, and investors should too. Download “A different sort of distressed-credit cycle” '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'An increasing body of evidence suggests the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic is K-shaped – implying a distinct bifurcation of outcomes.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Nearly everywhere we look in 2020, we see bifurcation, across macroeconomic indicators, countries, sectors and investment strategies. To help explain what’s driving this, we recently sat down with three of BlackRock’s Systematic investors, Jeff Shen and Raffaele Savi, co-CIO’s of Systematic Active Equities, and Tom Parker, CIO of Systematic Fixed Income, to take a deeper look at the bifurcation across markets and to explore some opportunities that systematic investors have been capitalizing on. Can you explain the bifurcation in performance this year? How do you think investors will remember 2020? Raffaele Savi: This year has been a year of divergence between the physical and the virtual. If you operated in the virtual world, you had a tailwind from COVID-19. If you operated in the physical world, this year has been a massive headwind. How that’s been translated in equity markets has been quite unique. If you look at the divergence in performance between the winners and the losers, the haves and the have nots, it’s one of the biggest on record. You can go back 100 years, and it’s hard to find this type of dispersion in country and sector performance. This dispersion informs a lot of the drivers of active performance this year. Looking at momentum versus value, there has been big divergence. The underperformance of value has been a pain point for a lot of investors. What we’ve seen this year is a combination of things. There are investments captured in value today that are structurally disrupted businesses, businesses facing challenges for decades like European banks. There are businesses that are dependent on commodity prices like oil and energy, but there are also companies like airlines or cruise lines that are truly COVID value stories. Looking across quantitative strategies, there has never been this kind of performance gap in history. I think it truly has depended on a few things: whether your process was dynamic; whether you were ready to adjust to a very different market environment; or whether you stuck to a very static view of what the right allocation was across different ideas in your portfolio. If your process was modern, and you were fully invested in alternative data, or if you dismissed that as a big alpha opportunity was a key differentiator. 2020 will probably be a remembered as the year in which alternative data became table stakes for investors. It’s very hard to navigate this sort of this fast-changing environment without ideas of how consumers are changing their purchasing patterns in real time, how this evolution has played out in different parts of the market, and in different countries. In 2020 we saw virtual outperform physical, dynamic outperform static, and modern outperform traditional – and that’s driven the big separation we’ve seen in terms of performance. 2020 has been an odd year for everyone. What previous market environment has the most in common with the 11 months we’ve just gone through? Jeff Shen: 2020 has been an extraordinary year; quite different from any in our recent memory. When you go back in history and look at which period is most similar, it’s quite interesting. 2020 is not a global financial crisis. The GFC period in 2008 was quite different compared to what we have gone through this year. There are a few reasons for that, but I think one observation is that the market dynamics are quite different. This year is more like the early 1990s. If you do the analysis, you realize the current cycle has been pushed into a little bit of an earlier phase. We were certainly looking more and more like late cycle, but COVID has pushed the economic cycle to be more like the early part of a recovery. Two characteristics are driving this trend. One is lower interest rates, especially in the U.S. and in other developed markets. They are pushing us closer to an early cycle comparison. Second is value underperformance, which has been significant, and also shares more similarities to an early part of an economic cycle. How has this recession been different from previous recessions? Tom Parker: Housing has always been a leading indicator of previous recessions. You can see that in the falling yellow line in the chart below, that occurs before every recession shown. Housing leads you in, and you know you’re in a recovery when housing starts booming. And that’s been a consistent pattern over time. US House Sales and US Unemployment Rate Source: Bloomberg, August 2020. The 2008 recession is notable for the extremely slow recovery in housing relative to previous recessions. The lack of strength in the recovery was primarily due to the fact that housing was ground zero in the boom and the bust. In that case, we had the slowest housing recovery in history. It’s interesting to note that lower housing and lower government spending explained most of the difference of the post-2008 recovery relative to the long-term average. It’s also interesting to note, just as this low housing and low government spending explained the recovery in the early 2010s, there was a big jump in housing late in the cycle that helped the economy over the last four years. This also increased government spending, which might be contrary to people’s preconceptions of what determined that recovery. The current recession, seen at the far-right side of the chart above, shows rising home sales into the 2020 recession. There was no slowdown. In fact, we had an acceleration of home sales. We got a small dip in the March period, and then we’ve had a boom. This is different from every other kind of recession that we’ve seen previously. A lot of the contributors we’ve seen in this recession have been different than previous recessions, and that difference is due to COVID-19. It has produced sudden-stop-and-restart economics. These trends have resulted in some of the dramatic bifurcations we’ve seen in markets this year. '},\n",

Download full report Top-down and bottom-up Much of the focus during this time has been on identifying differentiated alpha insights from non-obvious relationships uncovered via machine learning techniques in combination with novel sources of alternative data. While these techniques have become popular among quantitative equity investors, they are often beyond the reach of typical macro investors, those focused on the broad economic and geopolitical backdrop. These alternative tools only increase in importance during unusual times, such as the coronavirus crisis, allowing quicker analysis of a faster-changing investment backdrop. Because BlackRock SAE has already built the technology infrastructure needed to process massive amounts of data to produce investment insights for individual securities, we are able to use this approach to produce differentiated insights within the macro space as well. At its core, this approach is intuition grounded in economic fundamentals, supplemented by novel techniques and data sources, implemented in a systematic, unbiased fashion. Using a rigorous research process, we seek to generate uncorrelated investment ideas that offer a strategic advantage in timing important sources of asset price returns that are impacted by broad economic trends. Ultimately, BlackRock SAE is able to marry security-level bottom-up insights with macro-level top-down views in order to inform our positions on major drivers of returns, such as country, industry and style factors. We outline four important topics that are central to macro investing. Each of these helps form our differentiated approach to systematic macro investing. 1: Uncovering macro regimes Quantitative investors typically look for strategies that have consistent performance over long periods of history, but don’t react quickly to changes in the macroeconomic environment. We employ dynamic strategy allocation that accounts for different market conditions, borrow techniques from the machine-learning community and literature to take a different approach for the identification of macroeconomic regimes. 2: Assessing monetary policy sentiment To best capture sentiment around the monetary policy cycle, we have used natural language processing techniques on large corpuses of broker reports, news, publications and speeches by monetary policy committee members to attribute sentiment around future monetary policy decisions. The trickiest aspect of this exercise is filtering tens of thousands of documents down to those that are relevant to central bank behavior and specifically to individual countries’ policies. 3: Measuring macroeconomic uncertainty Uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment is traditionally hard to measure simply because macroeconomic series are released at low frequency. At the same time, the behavior of companies and policymakers is deeply affected by macroeconomic uncertainty. SAE has developed innovative tools for natural language processing that have typically been applied to text and transcripts associated with specific companies. Measuring macroeconomic uncertainty is possible using similar techniques augmented with adjustments that allow us to isolate information pertinent to countries rather than companies and appropriately design text queries. We offer an example of our differentiated process at work. Improving measures of macroeconomic uncertaintySeeking to capture what the broad indexes miss.

We are often able to capture more timely and granular views on macroeconomic conditions by using data that has a direct link to the broader economy, such as to track consumer sentiment, government contracts to reflect government spending, or maritime shipment counts to capture trade activity.

       "  'content': ' We study the returns and outperformance of private equity over the last four decades. Through various periods of financial duress, we analyze how private equity behaved in market downturns and discuss various stylized facts and return drivers. In addition, we provide insight into long term correlations between private equity and a set of observable variables. We wrap-up by discussing trends we see when entering the next decade. Download full report Strategic evolution The first private equity funds were created in the 1950s. However, there were few such formal structures and they were mostly marketed to individual investors rather than to institutional investors. A series of regulatory changes in the US and Europe enabled institutional investors to effectively outsource the management of fund investments to specialized firms and eliminate the need for in-house expertise. These favorable regulatory events together with the evolution of the limited partnership resulted in a spectacular growth of the private equity industry. Comparison to other assets A hypothetical investment of USD 100 invested in five different financial instruments on 1 January 1980 and assuming reinvestment of all proceeds provides a clear return comparison across asset classes. Private equity clearly shows the highest returns with an ending value of USD 27,024, equating to an annual time-weighted return of 15.0% - an outperformance of 5.5% and 4.3% over the MSCI World and S&P 500 indices, respectively. Significant outperformance of private equity at the asset class level Time-weighted returns across 5 asset classes Source: Value of USD 100 invested into five financial instruments on 1 January 1980. Private equity: Burgiss; Fixed income: Barclays US Aggregated Bond index; Hedge funds: HFRI FOF index; both MSCI World and S&P500 represent total return indices. Private Equity data sourced from Burgiss covers vintages 1980-2019, 5,643 funds, and USD 3,992 billion in market capitalization. Private equity strategies include all equity strategies. All dollar figures are USD. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future returns. However, as opposed to public equity investments where the investor is immediately fully invested, private equity managers call committed capital from their investors over time as they find investment opportunities and distribute principal and gains as investments are exited. For this reason, the timing and size of cash flows is more important than in traditional asset classes. Private equity practitioners do not typically report time-weighted returns but analyze and report performance in a money-weighted performance metric, the internal rate of return (IRR). The money-weighted mechanic of the IRR better reflects the timing and size of the underlying cash flows. In addition, TVPI and other multiples are used to reflect cash-on-cash returns. Historical performance Consistent outperformance over public markets over the past four decades Pooled, absolute and relative performance Source: Global private equity fund pooled, absolute and relative performance against the MSCI World index for 40 vintage years and 4 pooled aggregates – all in USD as of 31 December 2019. Private Equity data sourced from Burgiss covers vintages 1980-2019, 5,643 funds, and USD 3,992 billion in market capitalization. Private equity strategies include all equity strategies. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future returns. The above figure demonstrates strong performance for each of the four decades in isolation for various aggregates on both an absolute (IRR) and relative (direct alpha) basis. In aggregate and since inception, the direct alpha over these 40 vintage years (1980-2019) is 5.7%. This pooled outperformance is also substantial, when looking at different time windows and ranges from 3.6% for 5 years to 4.4% for 15 years. The 10-year pooled outperformance is the lowest, resulting from the longest public equity rally in history fueled by monetary policies. The equivalent outperformance on an absolute basis for TVPI ranges from 9% for 5 years to 16% for 15 years. On a look-through basis, the direct alpha or pooled outperformance over the MSCI World index is positive in 37 of 40 vintages. Key Takeaways Private equity outperformance over the MSCI World index is consistently positive and reports a lower decline than public markets during periods of high market volatility. Whether public or private, equity investments are exposed to the same factors and hence private equity returns show a high correlation with public returns. In the next decade, we see the private equity industry evolving with the democratization of access, the impact of technology, focus on ESG/impact investing, and the integration of equities.

Explore how a style factor-based approach to US corporate bonds may potentially generate improved absolute and risk-adjusted returns. Download now Style investing in fixed income Equity and fixed income investors alike have often strived to discern the drivers of investment returns. Over time, clear and persistent drivers of returns—known as “factors”—have been identified. BlackRock’s research has shown that the core principle of factor investing—systematically identifying and capturing persistent risk premia—also applies to bond markets. Style factors help explain differences in risks and returns within asset classes. Historically, style factors represent characteristics, such as quality and value, which may determine, for example, why one group of corporate bonds may have outperformed another.1 BlackRock has identified a broad set of fixed income style factors grounded in intuitive, fundamental investment concepts. The figure below provides an overview of the four principal style factors—quality, value, momentum, and low volatility—that we believe have the most application for investors. Overview of fixed income style factors Source: BlackRock. Based on the opinions of the Systematic Fixed Income Group as of October 2020. Forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions, there is no guarantee that they will be achieved. The information shown above is for illustrative purposes only and not meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Style factor application: Reach for Safety NOT Yield Today’s low yield environment has made it challenging to generate income and total returns while managing corporate bond risk. Investors are often forced to reach for yield and take on more risk to meet return and income targets—further bidding up the prices of the riskiest securities. While reaching for yield may work in upward trending markets, avoiding defaults when the credit cycle turns downward is extremely important to maximize total return in the long run. Consider an alternative approach to investing in US corporate bonds that reaches for safety—not yield. Implementing style factors in US corporate bond portfolios A “reach for safety” approach to credit investing blends the characteristics of two diversifying2 style factors—quality and value—into a single portfolio that seeks to minimize the drawbacks of reach for yield portfolios. First, a quality factor screen can be used to remove riskier securities that have a higher probability of default. Intuitively, we believe removing such securities may help provide downside mitigation and avoid the behavioral bias of chasing yield in riskier securities. Second, a value factor tilt can be used to favor bonds that appear to be underpriced relative to fundamentals. Value is a historically rewarded risk factor which seeks to identify bonds that are inexpensive relative to their financial strength.3 Blended style factor portfolio construction process Source: BlackRock. Investment process is shown for illustrative purposes only and is subject to change. Such an approach allows for the screening of riskier, overvalued exposures while simultaneously seeking to preserve market context yields and improve total return potential with less cyclicality. Moving from factor theory to portfolio practice This style factor framework has been developed into a set of rules-based credit indices through the BlackRock Investment Grade Enhanced Bond Index and the BlackRock High Yield Defensive Bond Index. These indices may provide opportunities to meet a mix of client objectives such as higher total returns, lower volatility and superior risk-adjusted returns versus market-capitalization-weighted allocations. Although the current live track record for these indices is only three years long, we believe the current results and the future of fixed income style factor investing are promising.

Click here to download full report What is GTAA? Global tactical asset allocation (“GTAA”) strategies serve as a counterpoint to long-term strategic asset allocations (“SAAs”), while still respecting targeted investment objectives. The breadth of these strategies adds opportunistic tilting away from SAAs, with the aim of capitalizing on shorter-term opportunities that may arise from market forces such as structural impediments, information asymmetries and innate human behaviors. The key feature of a successful GTAA strategy is maintaining a low correlation with other sources of return, both the broad asset classes in client SAAs as well as common factor returns and security selection alpha sources. If correlations with other portfolio return drivers remain muted, then this can be a highly additive contributor to whole portfolio results. Source: BlackRock as of June 2020. For illustrative purposes only. There is no guarantee that a positive investment outcome will be achieved. What prompts organizations to consider GTAA? As forward-looking expected returns and yields have compressed, many clients have shifted their asset allocations on a strategic basis into assets traditionally thought of as “riskier.”1 As expectations for improved outcomes in return or yield increase, they may bring with them unintended combinations of lower liquidity in stressed environments. GTAA strategies offer the potential to mitigate these risks through a combination of improved diversification benefits and enhanced risk-adjusted returns investing in liquid assets across asset classes. Most SAA processes rely on very long-term capital market assumptions around single asset returns and cross-asset correlations. We acknowledge the difficulty inherent in forecasting future returns. While capital market assumption analysis is valuable in assisting investors in the evaluation of more aggressive or conservative forecasts, this also highlights the wide range of potential outcomes, which can undermine our confidence in achieving desired long-term outcomes. GTAA is not a strategy that operates in isolation, but rather one that complements all the other drivers of whole portfolio risk and return. Episodic bouts of market volatility and the effect of geopolitical news on markets are seemingly more impactful as they punctuate an otherwise extended period of low volatility over the past decade. As a result, fiduciaries increasingly may question where we are in the cycle and how asset valuations stack up. In the post-pandemic period, we believe geopolitical stresses that existed before the crisis are likely to accelerate. Some clients are searching for immediate actions that can be taken in their portfolios around redeploying capital or adjusting exposures. GTAA strategies offer a flexible and nimble multi-asset solution that can capitalize on these exact market dynamics. What creates the opportunity for GTAA to make money? Financial markets are never at precise equilibrium due to the many cross currents of structural and behavioral forces. In our experience, a few persistent features of markets contribute to macro pricing inefficiencies which create opportunities for skilled GTAA investors2: Market segmentation and structural impediments Information and processing asymmetries Non-profit-motivated players This combination of market structure, asymmetrical information and different incentives across market participants leads to the variety of opportunities that GTAA investors seek to capitalize upon. Implemented in concert with traditional beta and alpha sources, a GTAA investment framework is set apart by its uncorrelated return profile, financial instrument breadth, and forward-looking application of alternative data. The outcome of this approach is a portfolio constructed from an adaptive opportunity set, which continually seeks to maximize potential return, mitigates unintended risks, and acts as a principal driver of long-term performance.

       "  'content': ' The role of multi-asset strategies in evolving markets If 2020 has taught us anything, it is that long held assumptions can change quickly and investors must be positioned to respond when asset prices change. Looking ahead, the prospect of an even more prolonged period of low interest rates is likely to challenge investors’ ambitions to generate returns from traditional market betas alone. We believe multi-asset strategies offer an opportunity to broaden the available opportunity set, improve portfolio diversification, better balance risk exposures, and seek returns that may navigate the gap left by traditional beta exposures. Click here to download full report Rethinking resilience from a multi-asset lens The first few months of 2020 ushered in a historic period of equity and fixed income market volatility. Government bonds, despite their low yields, provided an important level of diversification to investor portfolios. However, the diversification benefits of government bonds were more muted than in prior market corrections given the low level of yields at the start of the crisis1. With the low yield environment likely to persist, we believe investors may want to reevaluate how they are constructing resilience in their portfolios. This will require consideration of new approaches to help withstand a variety of adverse conditions and to achieve a variety of distinct outcomes—both on a tactical basis and strategically across cycles. In this research, we use three case studies to illustrate how institutions are implementing multi-asset solutions in practice to meet the following complex investment challenges: Enhancing nimbleness to navigate shifting market conditions While strategic asset allocation decisions are an important investment decision for our clients, many have begun turning to tactical asset allocation capabilities to seek incremental returns over intermediate time horizons. A tactically oriented multi-asset portfolio can help improve risk-adjusted returns versus a strategic asset allocation. By combining multiple diversifying drivers of return, tactical strategies seek active returns by exploiting short-term investment opportunities. The figures shown relate to past performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Source: Morningstar Direct as of December 31, 2019. Reflects annual net returns and risk for a hypothetical balanced portfolio consisting of 60% MSCI All Country World Index (Net Return, USD) and 40% BBG Barclays Global Aggregate Index (Total Return, USD) with monthly rebalancing. Improve diversification through macro factor exposures The desire for a portfolio that can perform well in a variety of market environments has led many investors to diversify their holdings across multiple asset classes and embrace strategies such as the traditional 60/40 allocation. But in recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that a portfolio that appears well-diversified across asset classes may not be sufficiently diversified across risk exposures. Macro factors capture broad, systematic risks that explain returns across asset classes, including economic growth, real rates, inflation, credit, emerging markets and liquidity. We’ve found that these six factors explain more than 90% of the returns across asset classes. By explicitly allocating to these factors, instead of asset classes, a balanced macro-factor strategy can avoid unintentional concentration in any single factor, as many asset classes share similar factor exposures. Improve the opportunistic search for income In the current low rate environment, the inability to earn a competitive yield in safe assets is likely to remain a consistent theme. Investors must choose between generating yield and stabilizing their portfolios, as securities that produce higher yield also tend to expose investors to greater, asymmetrical downside risk. A multi-asset approach to income generation can balance the tension between these two elements by focusing on yield per unit of risk. Click here to download full report Key Takeaways '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Risk parity is built for languid times The post-pandemic world is likely to look different, and as investors, we should reexamine our assumptions of portfolio construction in the context of this new regime. Risk parity, as a diversified, balanced, liquid strategy able to take on leverage, is well-positioned for what we see as the most likely scenario: low rates, low inflation and sluggish growth. Click here to download full report Risk parity strategies are built by diversifying sources of risk rather than asset class. More than ever, we believe these strategies are well-positioned to navigate the potentially turbulent markets ahead and uncertain macroeconomic climate. The world has changed. Historically reliable drivers of return may fail to deliver if we see sluggish growth driving assets sideways over the coming months or even years. Incorporating many diversified sources of return improves the chances that a portfolio will be able to deliver on its objectives. Revisiting our long-standing assumptions about portfolio construction A fundamentally different outlook for markets naturally gives rise to the question: what does this mean for building robust portfolios? Warning: Slow growth ahead The exceptional equity returns enjoyed in the decade following the Global Financial Crisis often obfuscate the importance of diversification and the danger in relying exclusively on one source of exposure (namely, equities) to meet investment goals. Equities have been the driving force behind portfolio returns since 2008, but portfolios that concentrate their exposure in this one return source may not fare as well in a post-pandemic world1. The long-term impact to growth assets remains to be seen. Our economic intuition suggests that the risk/return profile is likely to be lower going forward. The impact of higher taxes, government crowding out, de-globalization, and pandemic-related adjustments that will impact productivity are likely to result in a lower, albeit still positive, equity risk premium. Recognizing the importance of looking beyond equities, we review the historical performance of other assets following periods of stress. Using history as our guide, we can examine the last six post-recessionary periods (illustrated in the chart below) to understand the performance of various asset classes in the 36 months that followed the end of each economic recession. We find that, following all but the most recent recession, equities were not the strongest performing asset. As the U.S. economy slowly got back on its feet, credit, government bonds, and/or commodities outperformed equities. Annualized returns (%) for the 36-month post-recessionary period Source: BlackRock, Bloomberg, July 2020. Investors seeking consistent growth might consider balancing exposures across a diverse array of assets that are designed to generate returns in different environments. For example, periods of slow, positive growth tend to be supportive of credit assets, while a rebound in demand would likely benefit a commodity allocation. As emerging markets stabilize, expanding a portfolio’s exposure beyond developed markets can add additional diversifying sources of return to the portfolio. Diversifying your growth portfolio enables us to make better use of sources of return beyond the equity risk premium and fully exploit the benefits of diversification. As history reminds us, a post-recessionary period of sluggish growth may reward investors who diversify portfolios across a balanced set of exposures rather than rely on solely equities as the dominant driver of returns. Moving forward A future of sluggish growth and low rates presents challenges for traditional portfolio construction. Given the likely shift in regime as we exit the COVID-19 pandemic, institutions should consider how to add liquid, diversifying allocations which can deliver on return objectives while also serving as a source of safety and resilience during market turbulence. In this environment, we believe the optimal portfolio is one which is balanced across many diversified return drivers and employs a modest amount of leverage to target a level of risk and return consistent with investors’ needs — the blueprint for risk parity. Download full report Key Takeaways A well-constructed risk parity portfolio can take advantage of multiple lowly correlated drivers of return beyond just developed market equities and government bonds. A sustained low rate, low inflation environment may lead to higher Sharpe ratios and lower absolute returns for bonds. Portfolios which use a modest amount of leverage can scale a balanced portfolio to target a level of risk and return consistent with investors’ needs. If the dominant market risk remains economic growth uncertainty, stocks and bonds will continue to be highly diversifying sources of return. Risk parity strategies can complement traditional institutional portfolios as a diversifying and liquid source of returns. '},\n",

The search for clarity continues. The Systematic Active Equity (SAE) team's deep belief in ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues and the principles of sustainability that underlie them has led us to ask: Can we move beyond a compliance-only mindset to one that is more results-centric? Only in this way, we believe, can sustainable investing become truly sustainable. What’s in a number? For most of its recent history, sustainable and ESG investing has been characterized by a clamor for externally imposed standards. A host of third-party vendors has responded to this demand by providing ESG scores or ratings (See Sustainable investing: A ‘why not’ moment). We aren’t against scoring – to the contrary, a quantitative approach demands it. However, we also believe it is essential to take multiple issue areas into consideration when assessing sustainability, including indirect indicators of deep company attributes. Everything we consider must have an ability to tell us something about security performance, and not just a headline issue. Actively seeking solutions We took on the conceptual and measurement challenges in an effort to capture differences across companies.

       "  'content': ' Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins spoke with BlackRock COO Rob Goldstein about the trends that will shape the technology industry in the coming years, the future of work, fostering innovation and how corporations can engage with the communities in which they operate. After the conversation, Tony Kim, Head of Technology Investing for BlackRock’s Fundamental Active Equity Team, discussed how some of these trends are translating into investment ideas. Key insights from this session Trends shaping technology Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are at the top of the list of transformative technologies, as are augmented and virtual reality. When companies can apply AI and machine learning to the massive corpus of data that is available today, and they can utilize ultrapowerful computers that can be dynamically deployed anywhere, they’re going to be able to accomplish things that were impossible in the past. And we’re going to see virtual reality move rapidly from where it is today — primarily in the gaming world — into more and more business applications. Future of work One thing that’s become clear is that the notion of a physically enclosed enterprise is over. Corporations will need to allow employees to work from anywhere, and the technologies required to make that happen are going to be very important. This change will obviously impact corporate real estate footprints, and it’s going to profoundly impact the hiring process as well. When employees are untethered from corporate headquarters, that’s going to open up access to a lot of talent. And we’re almost certainly looking at less business travel in the future: The days of a 13-hour flight for a two-hour meeting are probably behind us. Fostering innovation Having an open, transparent, authentic communication culture is critical. Most great ideas come from people who are closest to the customer, and those ideas have to travel through the organization. So, companies need to ensure that they’re creating an environment where great ideas can bubble up. While it may be counterintuitive, companies that are managing the transition to remote work effectively may find themselves in a stronger position to innovate than they were in a traditional work environment. When employees are virtually entering their colleagues’ homes every time they have a meeting, it can create a stronger sense of community, which is key to driving innovation. Community engagement It’s more important than ever that companies engage with their communities, particularly those most impacted by the pandemic. In addition to community outreach and family assistance, corporations can make a big impact by focusing on three R’s: research, resilience and recovery. The first two have to do with funding to support the development of vaccines and therapeutics, and the third is centered around helping the education and healthcare systems evolve to a new reality. Education and healthcare are going to be forever changed by this experience.

We need a national strategy of testing that we all can feel confident in, and it’s got to be done in real-time. Rise of telemedicine The use of telemedicine has exploded during the pandemic, and it will continue to be utilized going forward. But we also need to see further advances in the technology. As telemedicine grows, it’s critical to make sure that physicians and patients have access to unified portable medical records that leverage artificial intelligence to help determine the best course of action.

       "  'content': ' The world is changing and so should our investment portfolios. Portfolio resilience has to go beyond government bonds and consider alternative return sources that can provide income and diversification. As the largest opportunity in private infrastructure, renewables are increasingly being asked to play that role in traditional portfolios. At the same time, rising investor allocations, increasing market participants and declining subsidies are changing the investment landscape. For investors today, navigating these ‘winds of change’ will be essential to get the most out of this resilient asset class. Download full report Navigating the winds of change We see three key investment themes: On the first theme, renewables markets are regionally moving through different cyclical phases and at different paces, reflecting local trends in demand, supply and policy. It is important to identify areas of relative value globally and avoid pockets of overheating. For example, Asia renewables today is reminiscent of Europe 10 years ago. South Korea is building 42 GW in wind and solar this decade alone according to Bloomberg – that’s equivalent to the UK’s entire installed base today. Balancing risk, reward and addressable opportunity Risk and return view of renewables market Source: BlackRock, proprietary analysis performed by the Global Renewable Power Team, June 2020. Capacity market data is taken from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Return is based on market data points and does not reflect investment strategy. We also believe that investing in renewables is not about avoiding risk altogether. It is about taking risks that are well understood and being equipped to manage those risks in order to generate best risk-adjusted performance. Construction and late-stage development risks are idiosyncratic and more directly manageable than long-term power price assumptions. At today’s competitive market for operating assets, we see material risk in more mature assets, as the return profile for operating assets is skewed to the downside Today, structural trends such as decarbonization and electrification are reshaping the energy industry and beyond. Investors should be equipped to position their investment approach and strategy in line with the market evolution. Being dynamic in portfolio positioning and embracing change are critical to getting the best out of the investment opportunity. Building portfolio resilience In our view, following these key investment themes, allows investors to get most of out the asset class and build up portfolio resilience through three key benefits of income, diversification and sustainability. Income: Investors are faced by fixed income yields that are at their lower bounds and equity dividends being cut or suspended. Income from renewables compares favourably to yields in other asset classes and has proven to be stable over time including during this pandemic. Diversification: Returns in renewable power projects are primarily driven by the availability of wind and solar resource, the capital costs to build new projects and the price of electricity. These idiosyncratic risks make renewables a natural portfolio diversifier and help reducing equity risk in an overall portfolio. Sustainability: Portfolio resilience is more than income and diversification. It’s making sure the portfolio is well positioned for structural themes. The shift toward sustainability is poised to give renewables a potential return advantage for years to come. Download full report Key Takeaways '},\n",

Pricing pressures abound Global prices for everything from oil and gasoline to cereal and milk are significantly higher this year, escalating pressure on consumers and companies alike. Median global inflation is nearly 8% vs. approximately 3% a year ago1, and the high absolute level of inflation will have lasting effects. High and persistent inflation can become more difficult to eliminate outside of a recession, and those risks are important to assessing credit fundamentals. No longer a rising tide Regime change is difficult to quantify, especially when it is occurring in real time. And yet the shift in monetary policy of both higher interest rates, an end to asset purchases, and in particular a reduction to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet highlight a significant policy shift in response to the highest inflation levels experienced in 40 years. A variable but persistent tailwind of the last many years which has come to an end, and now we’ll see what businesses are truly ready to withstand tightening financial conditions. Winners and losers As companies react to higher input and financing costs, the idiosyncrasies of individual business models begins to diverge. At a time of slowing economic growth, the risks and opportunities can be more pronounced, and offer greater alpha potential to those able to navigate them. Navigating greater uncertainty A wider distribution of outcomes is a function of more uncertainty.

       "  'abstract': 'COVID is driving big changes in global healthcare, creating both winners and losers. In this setting, private debt and equity can be effective ways to invest.',\n",
       "  'content': ' The Covid-19 shock is creating disruptions and driving structural change in many sectors, and nowhere more than in global healthcare. It’s the kind of setting where private capital, with its ability to tailor investments, accept illiquidity and anticipate long term change, can be especially effective. Yet deciding where to participate within this vast and multifaceted industry—which geography, which subsector, which part of the capital stack—requires bottom-up domain expertise. Here we draw on our recent webcast Private capital’s role in post-Covid healthcare to offer two distinct perspectives on opportunities in the industry, one from a European middle-market debt investor, the other from a U.S. private equity investor A European private debt view We expect greater demand for outsourced service providers as a result of the pandemic. The focus on treating Covid-19 patients along with social distancing is leading to postponement of everyday medical procedures, creating a backlog of demand. For the UK’s National Health Service, the consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates the backlog at an additional 1.6 million patients per month. This may drive demand for outsourced service providers in areas such as ambulatory surgery, diagnostics, radiotherapy and ophthalmology. We also have a positive outlook for home healthcare and outpatient critical-care services. These companies are extremely attractive from a debt perspective because (a) they provide essential services and (b) sponsors will pay high multiples for them, quite often in the mid-teens, so the loan-to-value for the debt is typically below 40%, and the cash-flow conversion is high because these are businesses that generally operate on an asset-light basis. In Germany, at companies managing diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy centers, we have seen lower throughput procedures (such as CT and MRI scans) continued throughout the crisis. However higher-throughput procedures such as mammography have seen a slowdown due to constraints in managing social distancing. We expect to see increased demand for those procedures coming out of lockdown. The ongoing consolidation trend in healthcare services across Europe is likely to accelerate, with smaller players struggling to absorb the additional costs related to Covid-19. Sectors ripe for consolidation include dental practices in France, Germany and the Nordics, adult specialist care in the UK, home healthcare providers, and contract manufacturing organizations. We also expect a wave of restructuring activity in the UK care home sector, where, sadly, there have been many deaths from Covid-19. These facilities are experiencing lower occupancy rates because of challenges in recruiting new patients during the lockdown. They also face up to 20% higher costs due to PPE, testing and higher staff costs, according to the UK Homecare Association. A U.S. private equity view The healthcare payer space—insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and companies that serve them—was an area with a lot of activity even before Covid-19, and we expect that to continue. I’ll give a few examples of companies doing interesting things: The first company provides analytics-driven healthcare services to optimize reimbursement payments, reduce costs, and ensure regulatory compliance for various stakeholders in the healthcare industry. It benefits from the growing demand for payment integrity solutions, tied to rising healthcare spend and increasingly complex compliance requirements. The second is a technology and services platform that allows primary care physicians to provide higher quality, value-based care to their patients using Medicare Advantage plans, which are offered for retirees by private insurers partnering with the government. This company benefits from the growth in Medicare Advantage and the shift to value-based care. Use of Medicare Advantage is expected to increase significantly. It’s currently around 35%, but likely to reach 70% penetration over the next 20 years, according to L.E.K. Consulting. The third company is a direct-to-consumer health insurance brokerage focused on selling Medicare Advantage policies on behalf of health plans. It’s achieved high growth, benefiting from the growth of Medicare Advantage, and from the rise of digital and telesales brokerages. These three private companies are classic examples of businesses where private equity can play to its strengths, enabling managers to make changes and build value over four to five years without the pressure of quarterly reports in public markets. In the MedTech space, Covid-19 is presenting opportunities within digital health, as it’s accelerated the shift to a broader virtual care delivery model. Digital health is a wide-ranging area that includes categories such as telemedicine, data analytics, clinical decision support, mobile health and remote patient monitoring. These companies often have strong growth potential because they solve pain points in the healthcare system by increasing convenience for physicians and patients or providing cost savings for payers. Private equity, including venture capital, is the best way to access these companies because you can invest at an earlier stage than in public markets, when these companies have higher growth profiles. One area with great promise is remote patient monitoring, which is getting a significant boost from Covid-19. Patients with chronic health conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure are the most at risk of complications or death from the virus. Remote monitoring of these conditions can be used to reduce emergency doctor visits and hospital admissions, so it’s a win/win for patients and payers. We think acceptance of remote patient monitoring will continue to grow. '},\n",

       "  'content': \" The economic fallout from the coronavirus has caused seismic shifts across global bond markets. We believe that investors may face a prolonged period of increased credit downgrades and fallen angel activity for months to come. A wave of credit downgrades In the immediate wake of the virus, ratings downgrade activity in investment grade corporate bonds has increased significantly. In March 2020, more than USD$400 billion of investment grade debt was downgraded at least one notch by one rating agency.1 The monthly spike is similar in magnitude to other monthly surges during periods of market stress such as November 2008 during the Global Financial Crisis, the U.S. credit downgrade in September 2011, and the global oil sell-off in January 2016. However, these downgrades as a percent of the Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate Bond Index (IG Index) outstanding, currently about 6% so far, are still lower than the most severe stressed periods we have seen historically. For example, November 2008 saw nearly 30% of the debt outstanding in the IG Index downgraded at least one ratings notch.2 Investment grade downgrades have spiked since the coronavirus outbreak Monthly IG downgrade volumes and percent of index outstanding Source: Barclays Credit Research, as of 3/31/2020. After 2012, IG downgrade volumes include companies downgraded by S&P, Moody’s and/or Fitch. Prior to 2012, volumes include only downgrades by S&P and/or Moody's. Index is the Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate Bond Index. Data only includes intra-index downgrades and not fallen angel bonds that have dropped out of the index. Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Longer term, the actual pace of downgrades may change as rating agencies continue to evaluate factors including whether stay-at-home orders across the globe will have temporary or lasting economic impacts, and what low oil prices may mean for numerous industries. A flood of fallen angels So far this year, about USD$130 of U.S. investment grade corporate debt has been downgraded to high yield, with some projecting at least USD$200bn total over the course of 2020 (Figure 2). 3 For reference, USD$200bn is equivalent to about 3.5% of the overall IG index or 7% of BBB-rated bonds in the index.4 Fallen angel bond volumes may top highs in 2020 Fallen angel volumes and percent of index outstanding Source: Barclays Credit Research, as of 3/31/2020. Index is the Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate Bond Index. 2020 estimate is based on Barclays Credit Research. On the positive side, the Federal Reserve recently announced two credit facility programs to support the high yield market. However, these programs are limited to issuers that were investment grade as of March 22 and are U.S. based and/or have a majority of U.S. operations. While this is stabilizing short-term, some longer-term fallen angel projections are as high as USD$700bn.4 Many of these downgrade projections have not yet been priced-in. We believe a wave of this magnitude would create lagged secondary and tertiary effects, especially in the case of a protracted recession. Fallen angel spread widening typically occurs well ahead of any rating downgrades, so we believe that investors need to start planning ahead. Navigating credit markets in the wake of the coronavirus While historic monetary and fiscal stimulus measures have helped restore liquidity to credit markets, it remains to be seen if governments are willing or capable of providing a lifeline to businesses whose debt load was not built to withstand such an economic shock. As we are only beginning to understand the potential long-term economic impact from the virus, we believe that this increased uncertainty can lead to both opportunities and risks for credit investors. Going forward, we believe investors should consider defensive steps to limit the return drag that ratings downgrades can have on their investment grade portfolios. At the same time, a wave of new fallen angel bonds may provide opportunities for high yield investors if the economy begins to recover. In this report we explore the current credit downgrade landscape and look at two different ways to navigate credit markets given this new environment. Key takeaways In the wake of the coronavirus, investors may face a prolonged period of heightened credit downgrade activity and fallen angel volumes. Credit-screened strategies may help to reduce return headwinds caused by credit downgrades in portfolios. A flood of new fallen angel bonds may offer an opportunity for investors who are currently rethinking their high yield allocations. Download now \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sustainability factors are even more important in long-term private investments—a point that COVID is underlining.',\n",
       "  'content': \" Investors have increasingly prioritized environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards in recent years. Now an economic shock of historical proportions presents the first real-time test of sustainable investing. Will the crisis push governments and investors to prioritize growth over sustainability? Teresa O’Flynn, Global Head of Sustainable Investing for BlackRock Alternative Investors, explained why that is a false dichotomy in our recent webcast, Accelerating sustainability. The following is adapted from her conversation with Mark Everitt, Head of Investment Research and Strategy for BlackRock Alternative Investors. What was the state of play in sustainable investing before the current crisis? We’ve seen a rise in sustainable investing in recent years driven by a few key factors: Firstly, the increasing incidence and severity of extreme weather events are moving climate, which is just one aspect of sustainable investing, to center stage. Secondly, we are seeing a growing number of regulatory interventions around the globe putting ESG at the center of the asset management industry. Finally, society as a whole is placing increasing emphasis on sustainability, and we believe this represents a structural shift for investing. The culmination of these factors led BlackRock, in January, to commit to making sustainability our new standard for investing. We did this because we believe that sustainability- and climate-integrated portfolios can provide better risk-adjusted returns to investors over the long-term. Since then, of course, we’ve had the COVID shock, and questions about whether interest will wane in a downturn. But if anything, the reverse is true. Public market data backs this up - we have seen strong flows into sustainable products during this unique time. Global sustainable flows totaled US$44B across the industry in Q1—a 57% year on year increase. What’s different about ESG investing in private markets? Let’s start by defining what we mean by Sustainable Investing: Sustainable investing combines the best of traditional investing with ESG insights in order to generate better long-term outcomes for our clients. There are two major elements: ESG integration, which is about risk management and investment process and applies to all investment strategies. Over and above integration, sustainable investing also includes those strategies that target specific sustainable outcomes such as renewable power. ESG is relevant for both public and private markets but is arguably more important for private investing given the long term and illiquid nature of the asset class. It can also be harder to do in private markets. For one thing, private markets do not have the same data set, particularly on return implications. In public markets, we have seen studies from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and others showing positive links between ESG factors and performance over the last number of years. It also requires a much heavier lift in private markets. There are no third-party ESG ratings reports to rely on. Instead one has to do all the analysis from scratch on the way in – digging into environmental reports, working with external engineers or interviewing management. ESG also needs to remain top of the agenda once you own the asset - a key element of private market investing is hands-on day to day asset management. ESG issues will vary considerably depending on what sector you are in (energy v healthcare v IT) and even within the same sector ESG issues can be very nuanced project to project, so this becomes an asset by asset decision. How will the COVID 19 crisis impact sustainable investing? This crisis has forced us as investors to question our assumptions in fundamental ways across the board, and that's true for sustainability as well. Most of the sustainable investing strategies in the market today have been developed in the 12-year period since the GFC, so this is an important test. We have seen resilience of ESG factors in both public and private markets during this time. We have seen an increase in the importance of “S” issues: supply chains, employee health and safety, retention and community engagement are examples of some of the factors that have come to the fore as some of the most material issues for companies’ resilience in the current environment. Governance issues such as the strength of a company’s risk management procedures and business continuity plans have been tested. These areas have been a key focus for investment teams across our business. In many cases, we’ve seen that a focus on these ‘S’ and ‘G’ issues has increased financial resilience during this pandemic. Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, zeroed in on this point in a piece he published in The Economist last month. His observation is that where the last crisis taught banks hard lessons about leverage, this one will change how companies balance risk and resilience. We have entered a world in which firms that operate with minimal liquidity, stretched supply chains and token contingency plans face a harsh judgement. We think some of these lessons are already appearing. Let’s turn to public markets again for a moment. Sustainable strategies have not just held up relative to non-sustainable peers, they have also in some instances seen outperformance and accelerated flows. Per Morningstar, ESG active funds have generally outperformed non ESG counterparts over the first quarter of 2020. 70% of sustainable equity funds ranked in the top half of their Morningstar categories and 44% ranked in the top quartile. In private markets, the best example of the resilience of ESG factors that we have seen has been in our renewable power infrastructure strategy, which benefits not only from low correlations with broader markets but also its positioning within a long-term global energy transition. As for client interest, I’ve already mentioned the flows we’ve seen into sustainability strategies on the public side. Our client conversations indicate that this interest is equally strong on the private side, with growing recognition of the structural shift sustainable is creating and the attractive growth opportunities it’s creating. How do you see the future? Climate change will remain a top focus – we are spending more and more time developing our analytical capabilities around this. We view climate risk as investment risk. We believe that technology can be better leveraged in private markets ESG. In our Real Assets business, for example, we are working with GRESB – the leading Real Assets sustainable investing benchmark – to help define the best approach for collating, monitoring and reporting on key ESG data. In our renewables business, we have developed an innovative impact reporting methodology to better quantify and contextualize the real-world positive outcomes and enable comparison across sectors and regions. We also expect a growing emphasis on the ‘S’ in ESG. This is particularly relevant in private equity – which has a special duty as a change agent and an important participant in the corporate restructuring ahead. We are encouraged to see industry adoption of sustainability standards – through our private equity fund of fund business we believe we play an important role in demanding the highest standards from the GPs we work with. Through our direct private equity business, which is focused on flexible hold periods and longer time horizons, we think we’ve brought additional focus to incorporating ESG into the underwriting process in all its dimensions, from prudent use of leverage to attention to stakeholders, to cybersecurity and beyond. I’ll close by noting that this is not an easy agenda. There’s plenty of work ahead. And as a fiduciary, we see it as our role to help our clients carry it forward. \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Markets have shifted, but there’s still a cohort of resilient, middle-market companies that need private capital.',\n",
       "  'content': ' The market opportunity for direct lending has grown significantly over the last decade, both in the US and in Europe. Direct lenders have filled a gap left by commercial banks, which scaled back on leveraged loans to middle market companies in the wake of the global financial crisis and have continued to deleverage. Now the COVID shock is shaping up as another milestone in the market’s development. Stephan Caron, Head of European Middle Market Private Debt, shared his assessment as part of our recent webcast, The dynamic opportunity set in credit. The following is adapted from his conversation with Mark Everitt, Head of Investment Research and Strategy for BlackRock Alternative Investors. Can you give us a snapshot of conditions in your market? In the primary market, deal flow has reduced significantly over the past six to eight weeks in both the US and Europe. Most LBO processes have been put on hold, with sponsors keeping lenders engaged to restart processes after the summer. Lenders are still assessing how to price risk in the face of continued uncertainty. The relatively few new deals in the current market environment typically include increased yields. They also have lower leverage and other improved lender protections. As you would expect, these are generally businesses with exceptionally strong fundamentals. Many private debt managers are focusing on preserving the value in their existing portfolios or reserving capital for defensive investments rather than underwriting new opportunities on the scale that they previously did. As we consider the impact of COVID-19 on various sectors, there is a wide range of possible outcomes. Some sectors will take an extended period of time to recover. The auto sector, travel and leisure and casual dining are all likely to operate below capacity for a long time and won’t be immune if there’s a second confinement period later this year. There will also be fundamental changes in consumer behaviors, and the impacts will be different in each sector. What’s the picture for the banks, and how does that affect your market? We see increased constraints on their ability to lend, especially in Europe. Unlike in the US, where corporates can rely on a variety of different non-bank lending sources, in Europe corporates are still very dependent on the banks for their financing needs. Banks are required to manage exposures to these companies within a risk-weighted-asset framework, and COVID-19 is pushing them up against their limits. Corporate customers have been tapping their undrawn credit facilities to increase their liquidity buffers. Banks also face increasing pressure in dealing with covenant breaches and unprofitable customers. The low-rate environment that seems here to stay is further limiting the financial flexibility of European and US banks. In the short term, banks have been lending to companies with loans guaranteed by governments—up to 90% of the principal amount in the EU, and even up to 95% in the US, with the “Main Street” program from the Fed. But overall, we have seen banks retrench back into their home markets. This will create an even bigger opportunity for direct lending firms to fill the gap going forward. As you look ahead, what themes are you seeing? Despite all the uncertainty, we can turn to our playbook from previous crises to identify those investment themes and sectors that have shown resilience and generated positive outcomes. From experience, the best vintages usually arise after a significant market correction, when there is less competition and better terms are available. One theme we see across both the US and Europe is the likelihood of more public-to-private opportunities. With attractive public companies trading at depressed valuations, private equity sponsors are going through their screens to identify those companies that would be more valuable under private ownership. We expect to see attractive buy-and-build opportunities in the EU. There are still many fragmented industries in the EU, where companies with low market share are now under pressure and may be acquired by market leaders. Sectors ripe for consolidation include software and technology, healthcare, the food industry and insurance brokers. These are all sectors where valuations for smaller companies with a low market share will become more attractive. Which industry sectors are you focused on? As discussed earlier not all sectors are being hit in the same way, and some sectors are to a large extent insulated from the current crisis. I’ll highlight two sectors that we believe will continue to see growth and show resilience as proven during previous cycles. The first is software and technology. Data is the new must-have resource and we can also expect higher IT spending than pre-COVID and a wave of investment in critical infrastructure and future tech. For example, we recently looked at a company focused on planning, building and servicing fiber networks in Germany. Germany is in the infancy stage of its fiber roll-out, with penetration significantly below EU peers (2.3% vs. 14% EU average, according to FTTH Council Europe) and it is estimated that it will take 15 years to reach 90% of household penetration. This is a key requirement for long-term economic growth, with €12bn of state aid earmarked for the fiber rollout, and the urgency has only been reinforced with the current crisis. In the US we looked at a manager of an online marketplace that provides staffing (primarily contract labor) and services to a variety of power verticals. These are examples of sector themes that will continue to grow and show resilience in the current environment. Healthcare companies are another focus. They are on the front line of this crisis. They must face it daily, lead us out of it and figure out the longer-term implication and shifts. It’s also proven to be a recession-resistant sector, with a lot of data showing that PE investments in healthcare generated higher returns during the GFC than companies in other sectors, both in the US and EU, and by extension this has resulted in lower default rates for lenders. It is reasonable to expect that governments will come to appreciate health more as an economic resource and will need to increase funding for infectious diseases and epidemiology-related issues. There will also be increased willingness to tolerate market access and profitability for products that can play a role in the prevention and treatment of future pandemics. It will take domain expertise, however, to distinguish potential winners from potential losers within these sectors. Some subsectors will benefit from the new normal. Some are currently hit hard but may rebound. And some will struggle. Let’s dig deeper into healthcare. Which sub-segments are attractive? We see great investment opportunities in three areas across the healthcare value chain: In services, we think telemedicine, home healthcare and urgent care will become the new normal post COVID, while primary care, ambulatory surgery centers and diagnostic centers will see pent-up demand post-crisis as patients increasingly seek care in outpatient settings. In med tech we see near term demand to address the crisis creating long term demand to increase inventory levels in PPE, sterilization and control and hospital equipment. We expect to see a return to normal in dental, diagnostic imaging and surgical instruments with a return of patients who have delayed those procedures. In pharma, the big firms will need to rethink their supply chains and diversify their manufacturing footprint, bringing them closer to home. This will create opportunities for contract manufacturing organizations. They’ll need innovation in R&D to treat new diseases, so we expect increased spending on data and analytics and virtual clinical trials. We’re more cautious when it comes to generics and specialty pharma where we could see more pressure on reimbursements. Healthcare IT spending is likely to continue along the lines of the general software trend, with use of data to address such issues as patient throughput /patient triage, which was difficult to manage at the peak of the crisis. Payer IT, supply chain IT and population health analytics should also be growth areas. The demographic theme of ageing populations across many developed countries provides further attractive investment opportunities. An example we looked at in the US is an independent distributor of senior-focused insurance and retirement products to the elderly population. That type of service isn’t going away regardless whether the economic recovery is a V shape, U shape or any other letter of the alphabet. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Private markets shifted significantly amid the COVID shock, underscoring the value of thoughtful, risk-managed portfolio design.',\n",
       "  'content': ' On the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic, valuations were rich across most alternative asset classes. As discussed in Private markets 2020, building an outcome-oriented private markets portfolio required even more selectivity and discipline than usual. The extreme market turbulence since then has underscored the value of thoughtful, risk-managed portfolio construction in safeguarding desired outcomes such as capital growth, enhanced income or stable income. The importance of understanding market factors within private exposures and the benefits of truly idiosyncratic and diversifying sources of return have become even clearer. In our recent webcast, Comparing private market opportunities, Pam Chan, CIO and Global Head of BlackRock’s Alternatives Solutions Group, applied this portfolio construction lens to the task of assessing opportunities across a greatly changed alternatives landscape. Following are excerpts from her discussion with Mark Everitt, Head of Investment Research and Strategy for BlackRock Alternative Investors. From a pan-alternatives perspective, how does this crisis resemble previous ones, and how is it different? I’ll start with a major difference. Private markets have grown significantly since the global financial crisis and will play a larger role this time around, over the course of a recovery that could take several years. The private markets have tripled in size from US$2.5 trillion in December 2007 to US$7.7 trillion today, increasing from 4% to 11% of public market size, figures from Preqin and MSCI show. So private markets will provide a much larger quantum of flexible and bespoke capital that can be used to finance rescues or long-term secular opportunities that public markets may not be suited for, or where public avenues may not be available. At the same time, given the depth of private markets, we may also see dislocations specific to them, perhaps with ramifications reaching beyond that private asset class itself. Also, the GFC educated investors on potential private market returns available during dislocations. We expect to see assets in the coming months available at very attractive prices as compared to recent history, but the question is whether those prices are attractive enough to compensate investors for the elevated levels of risk. We must underwrite investments in the context of anticipated structural shifts in the global economy. I’ll also point to the way opportunities tend to develop on different timelines in different asset classes. By looking at how returns played out post-GFC, investors can gain insights that will be useful this time around. Using data from Preqin, we’ve looked across asset classes to understand the sequencing of opportunities post-crisis and the speed of return degradation. Here’s what we observed: Distressed debt fund performance peaked with the 2008 vintage and compressed most rapidly. Opportunities in turnaround equity developed more slowly, as entry valuations took longer to adjust. Valuations were most attractive in 2009 and 2010 vintages, when EV/EBITDA multiples compressed by two times from their peak, according to S&P LCD. Finally, distressed real estate saw the greatest returns in 2010 and 2011 vintages, and those opportunities persisted for a few years bolstered by the impact of the Fed’s TALF program on CMBS and RMBS. This is in line with what our colleagues are describing today as well – i.e., it may take a little longer to see buying opportunities in real estate, but they will likely have a longer window. How should investors think about the resilience of private markets and their contribution to the whole portfolio? Private markets tend to exhibit less accounting volatility than public markets given valuations are less frequent and are not exposed to market sentiment. Most importantly, however, private assets are generally not subject to forced selling. Also, given that each private transaction is manufactured for a specific situation, investments may benefit from structural features that limit downside or insulate cash flows from exposure to broad market factors. Moreover, there are certain asset classes that may be inherently orthogonal or otherwise have less correlation to market factors. As one example, a structured payout arrangement on an oil and gas overriding royalty interest may allow an investor to trade capital impairment risk for extension risk amidst the energy market selloff. Then there are what we call “alternative alternative” (alt-alt) asset classes. Music royalties are one good example—consumer listening habits don’t change with movements in the S&P 500. Other examples include wetland mitigation credits and other forms of content IP. These niche assets make up only around 5% of the private market today but we believe they will play an increasingly important role in bolstering portfolio resilience to market turmoil. Preqin estimates that investors will allocate approximately 10% of their portfolios to a variety of niche / diversifying investments by 2023. In addition to deal-level or asset class attributes, portfolio construction and risk management are critical for building resilience for the overall portfolio – hence we spend a lot of time understanding each investment’s bottom-up risk factor exposure in order to avoid unintended concentrations of risk across what may on the surface appear to be diversifying investments (see The core role of private markets in modern portfolios). What opportunities are you seeing? We divide these into two categories: those that arise from negative catalysts—usually liquidity needs—and those that are driven by secular trends that may be accelerated by COVID. In terms of those driven by negative catalysts, we are beginning to see stressed and distressed opportunities. An example in rescue finance that we’ve been reviewing is a preferred equity investment with an asymmetric return profile – financing a large, high-quality, privately owned, financial institution. The company hedges their rates exposure and faced a significant margin call due to repricing. Aside from these temporal issues with their cash position, the business is otherwise robust and their need for execution certainty garners a premium. On the other hand, we see several sectors that are well positioned given existing secular trends and new COVID-related tailwinds. For example, the increased need for remote services will potentially benefit information technology companies in software solutions, cloud computing, online education, media content and e-commerce, among other subsectors. The question here is how to access these companies, since the tailwind, paired with the relatively low capital intensity of the businesses, mean they are less likely to need additional capital for survival. One way to gain exposure is through structured growth equity. We have observed that growth equity seems to be one of the more resilient strategies within private equity in terms of deal flow. Since 2000 growth equity has only made up 5.6% of buyout deal flow, according to Preqin. However, in a four-week period ending in late April, it made up nearly 20% of deal flow. A similar phenomenon occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 after Lehman crashed. Growth equity made up nearly 24% of deal flow during this time. Qualitatively we believe this might be true because growth equity is less reliant on debt financing than traditional buyouts. Along the same lines, growth equity is more reliant on increased output and improved business cash flows rather than optimizing capital structure through leverage. This lowers the overall beta to the market—the risk you are underwriting here is more company specific and idiosyncratic in nature. One current example is with an upstart online bank. We believe the company is well-positioned to succeed given its purely online business model. The dislocation could make it possible to structure downside protection while retaining much of the upside convexity of a typical growth investment. Any concluding thoughts? First, we believe there will be ample opportunity to buy well across private markets, which had been highly valued prior to this dislocation. Again, I’d underscore amidst all the uncertainty, the size and nature of the private markets today will give them a greater role in the recovery from this crisis than any one prior. Second, the key will be flexibility - investors will need to act quickly as opportunities arise and before returns diminish. Investors may benefit by being outcome-oriented and asset class agnostic as opportunities can be expected to shift across strategies and time, and may dissipate quickly as capital flows in. Third, portfolio resilience requires re-underwriting existing and carefully assessing new investments through a lens of market risk exposure. Constructing one’s portfolios in a risk-diversified manner is critical and, where possible, incorporating more orthogonal or alt-alt investments to capture non-market drivers of return can help.

       "  'abstract': 'We examine approaches to assessing total portfolio risk and discuss opportunities for clients that are rebalancing.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Recent unprecedented market volatility has revealed unseen risks and left many portfolios out of balance. To help investors get a better understanding of the risks that may be driving their performance, and to help guide rebalancing decisions going forward, we recently hosted a Market Pulse Call with Mike Pyle, Global Chief Investment Strategist for the BlackRock Investment Institute; Antonio Silva, Head of Analytics and Modeling and Chief Risk Strategist; Gabriella Barschdorff, Co-Head of the Americas Pensions Team; and Rick Flynn, Global Head of RQA Fixed Income and Multi-Asset Strategies. The group shared views on how risk models are performing in the current crisis, where they see opportunities for clients that are rebalancing, and how to integrate private markets assets into the total portfolio. It was a timely call, as the majority (56%) of attendees that responded to our polling questions are only somewhat comfortable with their ability to assess total portfolio risk, whereas less than one-fifth (18%) are very comfortable with their ability. Highlights of their discussion follow. During the global financial crisis, investors sometimes criticized the performance of risk models. How have models performed during the current crisis? It’s true that back in 2008 and 2009, we got a lot of questions about whether risk models were performing as they should be, but those questions are not coming up this time. Investors now have a much better understanding of what risk models are, and what they aren’t. Just as importantly, we now have a much better understanding of how monetary policy affects analytics and risk models. During the financial crisis, we were in uncharted waters when it came to Fed policy. But now those waters aren’t uncharted anymore. We are seeing some new fiscal policies this time, but we’re learning rapidly from them. And the work that we’ve done in the recent past on incorporating scenario analysis, namely around geopolitical risks, into asset allocation and portfolio construction decisions has certainly helped. As you use risk modeling to help clients construct optimized portfolios, what recent lessons are you applying? The first one that comes to mind is the importance of scenario analysis. Many times, people try to define risk simply as expected volatility, but that concept doesn’t mean a lot to most institutional investors. We need to go deeper and give investors a way to see how market events may impact their specific portfolio objectives—and that’s the goal of scenario analysis. Earlier this year we created a Covid stress scenario that modeled very large drawdowns in equity markets—with some sectors being particularly hard hit—and a massive flight to quality. And that’s pretty much what ended up happening when the coronavirus exploded. By walking through those types of scenarios and having conversations with our clients, we’re able to help them understand whether they’d be able to withstand a severe drawdown or whether they should be reducing their risk exposures. We also view the current situation as an opportunity to potentially re-underwrite the strategic asset allocations of our clients’ portfolios to try to ensure that they are aligned with their return objectives, their investment horizons, and their risk tolerance. And to see that they have the right measurement techniques to not only understand those risks but to explain them to other stakeholders. Finally, we are spending a good deal of time evaluating how different instruments may be able to serve as equity hedges. We think long duration Treasuries still have a role to play in helping to mitigate equity market volatility, but given how low rates are, the amount of ballast they can provide is considerably less than it was at the start of the year. So, we’re actively looking at other options. For clients that are rebalancing, where do you see interesting opportunities? In public markets, we think there are tactical opportunities for investors who can be nimble. There are myriad examples within fixed income, but two that stand out are distressed credit and securitized assets. The latter has become even more interesting with the recent expansion of the Fed’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). Within private markets, many assets are on sale right now. In a few years, when we look back at the 2020 vintage year for private equity (PE) strategies, we’d expect to see some strong results for those funds that were able to effectively capitalize on current dislocations. So, for long-term investors who can afford to tie up some of their capital for some amount of time, we think PE—including secondaries—is certainly worth a look in the current environment. When you’re adding private assets, how do approach the integration from a risk-management perspective? To begin, you have to work to overcome the information asymmetry that accompanies private markets investing. At the individual transaction level, you need to perform fundamental analysis, verify disclosures, confirm representations and warranties, and much more before committing capital. When you start to aggregate individual transactions into portfolios, you introduce some degree of diversification, but you can also wind up with common exposures across those different transactions. For example, you could end up with concentrations in geography or industry exposure. Using statistical models and risk analysis can help integrate these common exposures across both the public and private assets in the total portfolio to better understand the whole portfolio. Finally, once you start to have multiple private investments in a portfolio, you’re now dealing with a tremendous amount of detail and data from the underlying companies. It becomes critical that everyone who needs to track and understand that information—from risk analysts to portfolio managers—is on the same page and can speak a common language of risk. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Renewable energy was the most active sector in infrastructure investing last year, accounting for more than 50% of transactions, according to IJ Global. How is the market faring amid the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic? David Giordano, BlackRock’s Global Head of Renewable Power, gave his assessment as part of our recent Inspecting Infrastructure webcast. His team manages investments in wind and solar power generation, as well as power distribution and storage assets, across Europe, North America, and the Asia Pacific region. The following is adapted from his conversation with Mark Everitt, Head of Investment Research and Strategy for BlackRock Alternative Investors Tell us what you’ve been focusing on across the portfolio. With our construction projects, we’re paying close attention to potential supply chain and labor disruptions, which thankfully have not been major. To date, over a diversified portfolio, we are seeing only modest impacts to schedule. As for our operating fleet, these projects are largely operated remotely during normal times, and we continue to see consistent performance. Because we’re providing the essential service of electricity, we’re getting good local support for continued operations across all jurisdictions. We are monitoring the changes in near-term and longer-term power prices. Renewable power assets typically benefit from being highly contracted, especially in the early years. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the credit health of the offtakers as well as the forecasts for power prices. For utility scale projects, the counterparties have remained fundamentally strong credits. However, we are watching the impact on our commercial and industrial partners – both as off-takers and as service and warranty providers. On the financial front, the capital markets have maintained their support of the renewable power sector, and we have been able to complete several transactions in recent weeks. We speak quite a bit about the resiliency of the renewable power asset class and its benefits as a diversifier in client portfolios, and I think we’re seeing those benefits in the current environment. As the sun still shines and the wind still blows, our assets continue to perform well. The case for renewables rests in part on their role in an energy transition. Have recent events changed that? No, not at all. The collapse in oil prices has obviously been dramatic, but oil is mainly a transport fuel—it generates only a tiny percentage of the world’s electricity. Meanwhile, the structural drivers for the energy transition and the role of renewables in it are still very much in place. These drivers are mutually reinforcing. First, there’s the electrification of everything. Electricity has become the world’s preferred way of consuming energy, and its 19% share of energy demand is expected to grow to 45% by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. At the same time, we’re seeing continued cost declines for renewables.Solar PV capital costs have fallen by 85% and onshore wind costs by 49% since 2010, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Offshore wind has experienced a 32% cost decline in the last two years alone. Renewables are now cheaper than new coal across more than two thirds of the world. This is why the IEA’s 2040 projection estimates that two thirds of electricity at that point will be generated by renewables. In short, the global picture is a future of greater reliance on electricity, and greater use of renewables to produce that electricity. And that picture hasn’t changed. How has the pandemic affected the opportunity set in renewables? In the near term, we expect increased M&A opportunities as project sponsors look to sell projects, and power purchasers are focused on securing power at attractive prices to satisfy their climate goals, which haven’t changed despite the economic uncertainty. In the United States we expect to see an extremely active market toward the end of the year. There are a number of projects in the pipeline that will need capital partners to protect development value, and equity capital will have the most flexibility to manage risks and timing. With tax credits rolling off along with local permits and interconnection rights, time will be of the essence for many projects. We are currently in exclusivity on a portfolio of projects for commercial and industrial customers that will need to be done in time to qualify for existing tax benefits. We are also re-engaging on a large wind opportunity in the US. This was an auction process where the sponsor is now more focused on the ability to complete the transaction. How do the opportunities look in other parts of the world? The Asian opportunity remains a core part of our overall global strategy. Bloomberg New Energy Finance projects that 50% of the world’s electricity will be consumed in the APAC region by 2030 and that just over 40% of all new invested capital in the climate infrastructure space will be deployed in the region in the next decade. In Taiwan, we are working with a developer to secure equity rights in several projects. Taiwan saw over a gigawatt of new solar installations in 2019, which is just the start of their energy transition. We are working with two developers in South Korea on projects that will cover onshore wind and solar assets spread across the county. South Korea is also just implementing their feed-in tariff program to facilitate the energy transition, and these projects will benefit from 20-year power purchase agreements. Europe continues to offer a diverse opportunity set, but you need to be increasingly selective about geographies and sectors. The Nordics and Iberia offer attractive relative value whereas countries like the UK and Germany have recently seen a mismatch between the reduced opportunity set and large flows of domestic capital. Our team has been evaluating both sides of this market dynamic. For example, we are working on completing acquisitions in Portugal, while looking to divest assets in the UK. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BlackRock’s Head of APAC real estate discusses Asia’s property markets in the wake of COVID-19.',\n",
       "  'content': ' In nearly every sector, one can trace the grim progress of the COVID-19 pandemic from continent to continent, starting with its origin in China. Real estate is no exception. Real Capital Analytics reports that for the first 13 weeks of 2020, the volume of Asia Pacific deals valued at $10 million or more was down 56% compared with the same period in 2019. EMEA and the Americas, meanwhile, were down 18% and just 1%, respectively, though doubtless with worse to come. But being further down the road also means that APAC’s real estate markets may also offer a glimpse of what’s ahead for the sector. In our recent webcast, Windows on real estate, John Saunders, Head of BlackRock Asia-Pacific Real Estate, joined speakers from across our real estate platform to share his views. Following are excerpts from his conversation with Mark Everitt, Head of Investment Research and Strategy at BlackRock Alternative investors. The global real estate market has changed enormously since Q4 2019, and the changes began in APAC. Where did things stand on the eve of the crisis? Dialling the clock back to December 2019, we had a clear sense that markets were late in the cycle, yields were tight, there was too much capital chasing too few assets and there was evidently a lot of style drift in the market. In this region, the market cycle looked especially mature to us. The trade conflict had taken its toll on the economy in China. Hong Kong had pretty much stalled with slower trade and local protests. While conditions were strong in Japan, Australia and Singapore, assets were absolutely priced to perfection. With all this in mind, we approached the late-cycle real estate markets with the right degree of caution. We were far less inclined to bank on further cap rate compression. We were working harder to realise rental growth from reversion and asset improvement. We continued to seek out the untapped pockets of yield and income growth. So, coming into this coronavirus outbreak, we were already cautious on pricing. We stressed the need for disciplined investment, both in terms of a defined strategy and a keen awareness of fundamental pricing. How have things progressed in APAC since then? Surveying the landscape today, it is quite dramatic to see the abrupt changes in the market in the space of just the last three months. Obviously, what comes next will critically depend on this coronavirus. So far, we are seeing a little bit of good news on the outbreak in parts of Asia, with more signs of viral containment and fading momentum in infections in both March and April. The recovery in China has been long enough and strong enough to close down all the temporary hospitals and quarantine shelters; and to reopen factories, office buildings and train lines. Traffic jams are back in Shanghai. We are starting to see tenant inspections in our buildings again. Schools are being progressively reopened across China now and into May. Luxury retail stores are having some of their biggest trading days as buyers head out of quarantine and engage into some so-called ‘revenge spending’. Overall, there is a broader sense of a gradual return out of lockdown and back towards normality. This lays the groundwork for real estate transactions to return. However, I think the correction in asset prices will take several more months to realise. Where an owner is over-levered or poorly structured; or an asset is sitting in a fund with a long redemption queue, some of these assets will eventually come to market, with price discounts to match their sense of urgency. In that context, the strategy for us in 2020 is pretty clear. For existing investments, we are working very hard to maintain occupancy (above prevailing market levels) and ensure debt funding terms and covenants that are in excess of our expected needs, so that banks do not drive our hold / sell decisions – and on this measure our portfolio is sitting comfortably. How does this crisis compare with prior ones? Certainly, every market cycle is different, but there are some important and instructive points to draw out, by looking at these prior cycles. For us in Asia, not only have we seen the Global Financial Crisis and the dot com bust, but we have also seen the Asian Financial Crisis and the first-hand impacts of previous coronavirus outbreaks with SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2015. While those previous viral outbreaks were not as damaging or disruptive as this one, the mechanisms for market dislocation are exacting the same. With SARS, MERS and COVID-19, it is the travel, hospitality and related sectors that are the hardest hit. The effective shutdown of travel and tourism – then and now – did massive damage to the hotel and associated retail sectors. This time, the disruption is much wider in scope and potentially longer in duration. These tourism shocks do spill clearly into the retail market as well. This time around, the added impacts of social distancing and stay-at-home measures are driving a much more challenging retail cycle Where there is exposure to the food and beverage sector, there are some material impacts on turnover and rent collections as well, given diminished foot traffic and mostly smaller ‘mom-and-pop’ operations. While there is undoubtedly some drag on the office market, the impact has been relatively milder. In this region, larger tenants are not missing a beat with their work-from-home contingency plans. It is the smaller tenants who face more risk from the economic disruption and diminished revenues. For now, we see less direct cyclical parallels with the Global Financial Crisis and the credit crunch of 2008-09. Indeed, we are not seeing the same ticking timebombs such as the US sub-prime mortgages or leveraged buyouts. Bank balance sheets are not under the same degree of jeopardy, an assessment that is supported by equity prices and CDO spreads. The GFC drove a dip in asset prices that was sharp and long. Over the SARS experience, the price correction was milder and shorter. However, in both these cases, we saw that it took at least two to four quarters before capital markets found their true bottom and began correcting back toward pre-crisis levels. Assuming history repeats itself, we will see pricing corrections beginning to appear across the region during the latter part of this year. What are some of the developing opportunities to put capital to work in APAC? In the middle of a concerted pricing reset, I am quite confident that there will be no shortage of opportunities in the APAC region. We can see clearly the signs of mounting distress in some asset owners, whether that is coming from sharply reduced occupancy, binding debt servicing covenants or longer redemption queues. While the economic indicators are starting to come back in China, that is not the case everywhere. I think there is still a lot of time to find the right opportunity and the right entry price. And just because the most acute distress is coming through in hospitality and retail, it doesn’t necessarily follow that these are the best opportunities for new investment. Indeed, I think that the risk premia for hotels need a sizeable reset before they become competitive with other sectors, especially given the inequality built into the owner-operator contract model. Meanwhile, I think the strategies that have worked well in the past will continue to work well in the future. Specifically, assets with good, stable, recurring incomes reduce a lot of vacancy risks, especially during periods of weaker demand as we are seeing now. This notion has carried us well in core and even in value-add strategies. Moreover, we like markets with a positive spread – a dependable yield in excess of funding costs. That positive carry means that time is working in our favour and we are less reliant on pure capital gains or yield compression. In this context, markets like offices in Australia and Japan and industrial in Singapore continue to deliver the most pipeline potential. In Japan in particular, we have recently been engaged by numerous vendors where their public sales processes have fallen over due to the impacts of COVID-19. Our track record of off-market deals in the most liquid markets of Tokyo and Osaka and history of working with domestic owners of distressed assets to develop creative take out solutions is attractive in a market like Japan. Through our relationships with local Japanese banks, we have previously been recommended as a solution provider to vendors who may be concerned about near term lease expiries or loan covenant hurdles which require the hands-on, active asset management our teams can provide Ultimately, we have the on-the-ground capacity to operate across multiple markets and all the sectors across the APAC region. In an unfolding market correction and improving value, what we do will greatly depend on price (and the prospects for rent reversion and therefore also price reversion). While we have clear preferences to find recurring income, fixable impairments and positive carry, we have considerable scope to achieve our goals through a number of strategies, particularly as we move through the bottom of the market cycle.

       "  'abstract': 'Our investors share their views on macro themes in today’s markets, portfolio positioning and traditional assumptions.',\n",
       "  'content': \" The impact of the coronavirus pandemic has stretched across asset classes, geographies, and time frames, leaving investors around the world concerned with additional risks they may face in meeting their desired outcomes. To provide some holistic portfolio insights that may help, we recently asked three senior investors from our multi-asset strategies platform to weigh in on how they are navigating this environment. What have been the key themes that the multi-asset teams have been discussing in recent weeks? Van Nostrand: Three key themes have emerged across our diverse set of multi-asset teams over the past couple weeks. First is the impact on economic activity. How deep are the troughs in GDP growth, in corporate profits, in labor markets, and how long are they going to last? It’s only with that fundamental outlook that we can have confidence in taking active investment decisions. The second theme is how markets are currently assessing the economy. This is important, because when we take an active investment position, we're looking for a gap between what the market is discounting in terms of economic output and our own fundamental view. The third theme is the 2021 economy. We are spending a lot of time thinking about the ways that this crisis is going to change the way our economy operates over the long run, even once we're out of the hole that we find ourselves in today. How do you adapt your process in an environment that is atypical and very different from what you've had to manage through? Becker: First, this is a different kind of recession. Recessions in the past 100 years in the United States have almost always been caused by one of two things. Either the Fed has induced the recession by tightening monetary policy to control sharp inflation, or some bubble in financial or real assets has gotten out of control and burst, creating a destabilizing, financially led recession. This current crisis is more akin to a natural disaster. A particularly sharp and globally coordinated natural disaster that hit everyone at once. We tend to see opportunities at the intersection of our insights on the macro environment and market pricing. The speed with which asset prices are moving in the current environment and the lack of timely macro data has meant that our process is more informed by pricing insights. For example, we observed in February that volatility-constrained funds were forced sellers as volatility spiked, and that was further exacerbated by the rise in correlation between stocks and bonds in mid-March. That pricing dislocation provided tactical opportunities for some of our teams to add risk in equities and increase duration in portfolios. We’ve also analyzed epidemiological data from multiple sources and combined it in a way that can generate some actionable insights. We've emphasized the capacity constraint of healthcare systems, both at the country and local levels as markets have become fixated on that metric. We are also doing analysis on the impact of containment measures like social distancing and have found that buying markets that implement more stringent measures worked well over the last few months. A key tenant of diversification is having ballast from fixed income. Given how far rates have fallen, how do you view bonds today? Hodges: The consistent surprise in the markets for years has been that interest rates have been expected to go up, but have instead fallen. So, our view on fixed income is twofold. On one hand, there is an environmental diversifying aspect of holding bonds because they are exposed to different economic drivers than other risky assets. They have been a good asset to hold through negative growth shocks. That could continue to happen as interest rates approach zero. However, there is also a long-term investment problem that comes as yields shrink toward zero, which is that carry is limited. We have started to diversify our diversifiers by looking at other flight-to-quality assets that offer a similar economic exposure as bonds but are less sensitive to the direction of real interest rates. This includes things like adding gold, hedged against industrial metals, or implementing a steepener trade in U.S. fixed income that tends to pay off well in a crisis environment, but can be duration neutral. As yields on traditional government bonds approach zero, these other exposures, which may not have great long-term returns but offer potential protection, become relatively more attractive. Looking beyond just the role of fixed income in a portfolio, it’s fair to say that we are going to be doing a lot of re-evaluation of some of the long-standing assumptions of our investment playbook. We recognize that a lot of those long-standing assumptions about the way the global economy works might be shaken by this crisis, not just for a couple months, but in the years to come. \"},\n",

       "  'content': ' Fund close marks the largest alternative asset fundraise in BlackRock history Fund size exceeds original target and fund hard cap BlackRock’s Global Energy & Power Infrastructure Fund (‘GEPIF’) has achieved a US$5.1 billion final close of Global Energy & Power Infrastructure Fund III (‘GEPIF III’ or ‘the Fund’), making it the largest alternative investment fundraise in BlackRock history. The final close value also exceeded both the original Fund target of US$3.5 billion and the original hard cap of US$4.5 billion. “This milestone is a testament to BlackRock’s focus on helping clients achieve better investment outcomes,” said Edwin Conway, Global Head of BlackRock Alternative Investors. “Investors are looking to build resilience into their portfolios and ballast against equity market shocks by increasing their allocations to less correlated exposures in private markets. The current market volatility has underscored the value of our commitment to delivering solutions that can help our clients match their long-term liabilities and support their beneficiaries. Investor demand for this fundraise reinforces our belief that infrastructure will play an increasingly important role in portfolio construction moving forward.” The Fund’s commitments include investment mandates from over 50 institutional investors, including public and private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, foundations, insurance companies and non-profit organizations across the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Mideast. Over 70% of the commitments are from investors in the prior fund, which reflects investors’ high-level of confidence and trust in the GEPIF team and its expertise in the space. Building on the investment strategy of its predecessor funds, GEPIF III aims to generate strong uncorrelated returns from investments in high-quality and essential energy infrastructure businesses and assets. These companies will generally have long-term contracts and visible revenue streams from strong counterparties and seek to provide robust dividend yields to investors. The investments are diversified geographically and by energy sub-sectors, which primarily consist of: 1) the power sector, including electric power generated from renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro and waste-to-energy) and from natural gas, while excluding coal-generated power, 2) the midstream sector, including energy transportation and storage, and 3) the utility sector. Mark Florian, Head of the Global Energy & Power Infrastructure team within BlackRock Real Assets, said: “The success of the fundraise reflects the search for diversified returns in a yield-starved environment, which continues to be front of mind for investors. Our strong off-market sourcing capabilities are differentiated by a disciplined investment approach focused on creating an optimized risk-adjusted return for our investors and a tailored solution for our partners and their customers. This philosophy has led to strong investment deployment and origination that includes multiple repeat partnerships with great companies, and we believe this strategy will continue to create many investment opportunities for our Funds.” BlackRock Alternative Investors is designed to serve investors today and tomorrow as they seek outperformance in real estate, infrastructure, private equity, credit, hedge funds and alternative solutions. We strive to bring our investors the highest quality investments by drawing upon our global footprint, superior execution capabilities and position as a preferred partner. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'How can investors allocate risk and stay focused on the long term while confronting tremendous short-term disruptions?',\n",
       "  'content': ' As the coronavirus pandemic roils financial markets, investors need to determine how to allocate risk in the face of unprecedented circumstances and how to think about the long term, even in the face of tremendous disruptions in the short term. Mike Pyle, our Global Chief Investment Strategist, explored these themes with Alan McKenzie, Chief Investment Officer for Family Offices, and Phil Green, Head of Global Tactical Asset Allocation, as part of our April 2 Market Pulse Call, Rebalancing and Tactical Opportunities. It was a timely conversation, as more than half of the respondents to a poll we conducted during the call stated that they anticipate making tactical or opportunistic investments in undervalued or attractive segments of the capital markets. Highlights from the call follow. How are clients managing the imperative to rebalance portfolios in the short term with the need to stay focused on long-term objectives? Let’s start with the long term. The world is different now than it was a month ago, and so our views on asset class returns, on the interaction of different asset classes, and on the role those assets play in a portfolio are very different. We need to ask questions like, What is the role of government bonds in a portfolio when interest rates are effectively zero? How does one navigate a very unclear environment for equity earnings? What is the likely path of interest rates? What’s going to happen with credit spreads? The answers to these questions may have a profound effect on what a strategic asset allocation (SAA) should look like. We polled more than 750 clients in a recent Market Pulse call, and more than a quarter of them are making changes to their long-term SAAs, which speaks to the magnitude of the moment and to the importance of getting the SAA right. Also, if the past few weeks have taught us anything, it is that we must approach the construction of an SAA with a great level of humility. BlackRock’s capital market assumptions, for example, and our resulting portfolio optimization processes, factor in the uncertainty around future returns and seek to build more resilient portfolios so that we can be better prepared for a wide variety of market outcomes. As for the shorter term, we believe rebalancing is a very important tool, and that it instills discipline in any institutional portfolio. But what we strongly advocate is the need to be flexible and dynamic. Even with clients who are very systematic with their rebalancing, like pension plans that may have hit a specific trigger, we would look to rebalance over a period of days to weeks depending on market liquidity. Does the unprecedented environment that we’re in require investors to reshape their approach to alpha generation? At the highest level, our process is simple: we’re looking to buy cheap assets. And there are three key things we think about when we’re gauging what’s cheap. The first is to determine what the fundamental drivers of asset prices are in this environment. The main fundamental driver right now is the virus itself. We’re certainly not scientists, but we are data professionals, and so we look at the data. We think that the balance between supply and demand for ventilation beds in intensive care units is probably the single most important variable that can help us gauge how effectively different countries, states and municipalities are combatting the virus. So that metric is front and center in our analysis of potential opportunities. The second thing we think about is what is already priced into markets. Basically, we want to know if the market is accurately pricing in the fundamental return drivers that we’ve identified. Finally, if we’re considering making a trade, we want to know who is on the other side of that trade. We want to know if the price at which they are willing to transact reflects the fundamentals, or if it reflects something else. This has really come into play over the last month. We’ve seen many market participants across risk assets like equities and credit, as well haven assets like government bonds, that did not have a view a on fundamentals, but were essentially what we’d call information-less traders. Obviously, that gives us a greater sense of conviction when transacting with these participants. Where are you seeing the most engagement from clients that are looking to capitalize on long-term opportunities? If we look back at the financial crisis, one of the things we learned is that, in periods of market turmoil, you don’t necessarily have to go very far down the capital structure of a company to potentially earn compelling returns. We think that dynamic is at work currently, and that it is creating value in many parts of the credit market. So, we believe that credit can perform quite well alongside equities over the next few years. This is a theme that is resonating with many clients. And because there are still some sellers that aren’t particularly concerned about the fundamental value of certain assets, we think we’ll continue to see opportunities for clients who are concerned about the fundamental long-term value of those assets to purchase them at potentially attractive prices.

       "  'abstract': 'As the world plots its emergence from coronavirus closures, the pace of recovery and prospective outcomes look diverse.',\n",
       "  'content': ' As individual countries, states, industries and companies plot their emergence from coronavirus closures, the pace of recovery and prospective outcomes are looking increasingly diverse. Jeff Shen considers some of the implications. In many ways, the coronavirus pandemic has reinforced investment trends that were in place prior to the crisis. Among them: Developed markets outperforming emerging markets (EMs), technology leading all other sectors, momentum outperforming value, and U.S. stocks outpacing the rest of the world. Yet we also have seen new trends starting to emerge. This is partly because the recovery from COVID-19 and its economic shock is unlikely to be of the same magnitude everywhere. Using big data analysis to track the spread and trajectory of the virus, our Systematic Active Equity (SAE) team has found that the experience across countries, cities and individual markets has been very different, depending on factors such as when lockdowns were put in place and enforced, how long they remained in effect, and how virus detection and antibody testing have evolved. The result has been a level and degree of dispersion not seen for some time ― and, in turn, an opportunity for active stock selection to make a bigger difference than it has in years. An asymmetrical outlook for EMs In an environment where regional recovery is uneven, we see country as a unit of analysis becoming more relevant for investment decision-making. In particular, our data covering the universe of emerging countries finds dispersion has tripled since January, reaching its highest level since the global financial crisis. We find the differing experience across emerging economies has hinged on the individual response throughout the various stages of the coronavirus crisis. For example, countries like Brazil, Russia and Mexico were slower to contain the spread of the virus with policy actions like social distancing and reduction in non-essential business activities. COVID-19 cases and deaths consequently continued to accelerate faster than elsewhere in EM, and recovery appears farther away. Meanwhile, Asian countries such as South Korea, Taiwan and China have been faring better than other EMs given the relative strength of their health care systems. Greater fortitude on the health front has facilitated re-openings, helping to stem some of the economic damage and supporting stock prices of companies that have a higher relative exposure to those countries. Further dispersion is evident in countries’ willingness and capacity to provide the fiscal and monetary policy support needed to mitigate the economic consequences of the pandemic. Countries like South Africa, Turkey, Mexico and Brazil look more vulnerable than the rest. We see current account deficits, levels of government debt and other macroeconomic indicators as factors that will separate winners from losers. Open, but will they come? As we approach the next phase of the COVID-19 emergency, we are looking to identify the main drivers of recovery in countries, industries and companies. Part of the challenge is in determining how permanent some of the changes in human behavior may be. Our data has found that even as countries and businesses take steps toward normalcy, with restaurants and stores opening their doors, consumers can be slow to return. Robust online transactions in China, which is farthest along in the virus trajectory and re-opening, indicate consumers may be content to stay home and have goods delivered. A look at China mobile app usage, as shown below, also is telling. Since February, the biggest bounce has been seen in job search and home purchase apps, personal priorities as economic and business activity starts to normalize. Meanwhile, rebounds in ride sharing (DIDI) and driver testing (a pre-requisite to car buying in China) may suggest a continued aversion to mass transit. A smaller recovery was seen in trip-planning app CTRIP. We expect business models that require human congregation, such as cruise lines and live concerts, are likely to face structural headwinds arising out of the pandemic. Shades of uptick Source: BlackRock, with data from Aurora Mobile, May 2020. SAE has developed a framework to actively capture those tactical insights that we believe will remain relevant for as long as markets and economies are processing the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. These insights sit alongside our standard research process and incorporate real-time data processing. We believe this new input is critical in an environment where a return to work does not necessarily equate to a return to normal ― and where the world is likely to look very different than it did before any of us ever heard the term COVID-19.

       "  'content': \" The last few weeks have provided a test for fixed income markets, from liquidity challenges in key areas to extreme price movements across a range of assets. Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s CIO of Global Fixed Income, offers insights on how markets are functioning, what effect the U.S. Federal Reserve is having, and where he sees opportunity amid market dislocation. How would you rate the response of the Fed to the turmoil in fixed income markets? RR: Since this crisis started to affect markets, the Fed has shown that it is very sensitive to market dislocations, and that it is willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that the dislocations do not persist, or at the very least, that they are minimized. The Fed is really focused on making sure that transmission mechanisms remain smooth and efficient and on trying to restore effective functioning in the markets. It has committed to unlimited quantitative easing (QE) and recently announced that it intends to buy US$75 billion a day in the Treasury market, and that it will also buy a wide range of assets including corporates, commercial mortgages (CMBS), and bond ETFs. To put that figure in perspective, during the financial crisis, the Fed was buying US$75-85 billion in assets a month. The amount of liquidity the Fed is putting into the market currently is extraordinary. So, I’d say the overall response has been tremendously constructive. Has liquidity improved since the Fed acted? RR: It depends on which sector of the market. The repo markets were one of the first places to come under severe stress and, not coincidentally, one of the first markets that the Fed stepped into. Funding markets have now largely returned to normalcy, and that’s hugely important to the overall functioning of the system. The other part of the market that is hugely important, and that wasn’t functioning properly, is the Treasury market. But now that the Fed has become a large-scale buyer, liquidity has meaningfully improved. It may not be all the way back to pre-crisis levels, but it is significantly better. Until the Fed helped to restore some order here, it was very difficult to price other fixed income assets accurately, because they take their cue from the level of Treasury prices. And because the Fed has been actively buying off-the-run securities, that’s allowed those securities to come off of dealers' balance sheets, which enables the dealers to provide more liquidity to the market. The agency mortgage market, like the Treasury market, is seeing much better liquidity as the Fed has become a large buyer of mortgages. As you move further out the risk spectrum, things are also improving, albeit more slowly. Liquidity in investment grade credit is getting somewhat better, especially in the front end of the curve. In securitized markets, we believe there is still some liquidation that’s taking place, but the market appears to be stabilizing from some unusually weak levels. Is there anything else that the Fed can do, or have they spent all their bullets? RR: I think the Fed has unlimited bullets, particularly with inflation running as low as it is, and I expect that it will continue to do whatever it takes to ensure that markets function smoothly. We've already seen the Fed step in and do things that it hadn’t in the past, like buying corporate bonds and ETFs and launching lending programs to directly support small and medium enterprises, states and municipalities. So, to think that there is nothing more it can do would be mistaken. How are all of these developments affecting your portfolio positioning? In the U.S., I think you want to follow the Fed. So that means investing in Treasuries as a core part of the portfolio today, with more exposure out the yield curve than earlier in the year due to carry and hedging-potential longer on the curve. While mortgages were very attractive and will be well-supported by the Fed, their valuations have richened considerably. Credit looks reasonable again, for the first time in a long-time. We would continue to follow the Fed towards the investment-grade market with some higher-quality high yield. Also, the securitized market, particularly high-quality asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage paper, looks reasonable to us today, with some tactical exposure to high-quality CLOs. Over in Europe, the European Central Bank has had its own “whatever-it-takes” moment. It is buying close to 130 billion euros a month in fixed income and is looking to monetize any fiscal needs going forward. We think this will go a long way to helping Italy, in particular, and that we’ll see spreads between Italy and Germany continue to compress. Finally, I’d add that this is still a time to run a high level of cash in portfolios, both to mitigate the downside and to take advantage of evolving opportunities. \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Our leaders discuss the challenges and opportunities facing private market investors amid current turmoil.',\n",
       "  'content': ' The last few weeks have been a whirlwind. Public markets are reacting with extreme volatility as they struggle to process a flood of news and determine economic implications amid significant unknowns. How does this look through the long-term lens of private markets investing? Mark Everitt, director of research for BlackRock Alternative Investors, says that for private market investors, the current turbulence is “a live test of underwriting and portfolio construction processes conducted over the last few years.” At the same time, market dislocations can also create potential opportunities for private capital—the foundations for future long-term returns. Mark discussed these twin themes with BlackRock Alternative Investors CIO Jim Barry as part of our March 18 webcast, Private markets in a time of turbulence. In his role as CIO, Jim has visibility across the private markets, including real assets, private equity and private credit. Highlights from their discussion: Let’s start with a quick summary of how you see the world today. What’s unique about this crisis is that it’s all being driven by a non-economic vector. It’s all about the virus. Its path, and the monetary and now fiscal interventions in response are the key to understanding how this will evolve. We’ll keep seeing volatility until we start to understand where it’s headed, what the load on the health systems is going to be, and the full set of policy responses. A second unprecedented element is the pace and scale of the impacts, which brings its own stresses. We’re seeing supply and demand plunge in tandem, which makes it harder to counteract. Asia is several months ahead of us in this crisis. What signals are we seeing there? All eyes should be on China and APAC in terms of understanding what any bounce-back could look like. In China we’re already seeing some of the macro indicators come back to within 50% or 60 % of historic levels, which is encouraging. It’s early days, though. And there may be a bifurcation between general industrial and corporate activity and consumer behaviour, particularly behaviour that requires consumers to leave their homes. As an example, we have some direct investments in car parks in Shanghai. Their workday bounce-back has been substantial, with a lot of new customers looking for short term contracts as they move from public to private transport as they go back to work. But at the weekends, those same car parks are dead. Looking at APAC will help us understand the economic implications as we start to get the disease under control elsewhere in the world. Turning to our investment portfolios, what are you focused on? Everyone’s reviewing all their investments. At BlackRock we’ve already done an initial sweep across our portfolios and identified potential vulnerabilities. It’s an asset-by asset process, and the true assessment comes from really understanding the cashflows. You need to look at their resilience in a new macroeconomic context. In our underwriting, especially for the past two years, we’ve been factoring in some form of recession, but nothing with the pace and impact of what we are seeing in 2020. We have a big focus on both the liquidity within the business, and then any liquidity dynamics associated with the capital structure. Particularly any requirement for a refinancing, or for that matter an opportunity for a refinancing to take advantage of monetary easing. There are portfolio level checks, such as confirming intended resilience from geographical diversification. And there’s a great deal of revisiting asset-level underwriting: How much of the revenues are tied to fixed price contracts or volume commitments? What’s counterparty risk, and how are the counterparties doing? We need to be sure we understand the resilience of the capital and covenant structures for all our assets. What about potential opportunities? Obviously, the existing portfolios are getting a lot of attention, but we’re not closed for business. For anything in the pipeline we’re taking a real step back, not just to re-underwrite the context, but also because pricing is now massively uncertain. Certainly, there will be a drive to quality, and we do see opportunities, particularly toward the end of the second or third quarter as companies look to get liquid. They may do this through the sale of quality assets, often off-market—bilaterally, so they can be done quietly. Private markets can provide solutions for companies or projects when public markets have grown volatile and risk averse. Speed and the ability to structure deals and handle complexity are important advantages, and we see them coming into play as we start to work through this major dislocation. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Our guide to private markets offers a timely analysis of 13 distinct asset classes organized by three common outcomes.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Investors making long-term decisions in illiquid markets have much to consider as they begin 2021. Covid is intersecting with deep shifts in the economy and society, driving changes that span asset classes and reach well into the future. We believe an integrated view of private markets is especially important now, and in early January we convened investors from across our platform to compare their outlooks in a webcast. Following is a summary of the discussion between Jim Barry, CIO of BlackRock Alternative Investors (BAI) and Global Head of Real Assets; James Keenan, CIO and Global Co-head of Credit; Nathalie von Niederhaeusern, Head of EMEA for Private Equity Partners; and Mark Everitt, Head of Investment Research and Strategy for BlackRock Alternative Investors. How we begin the year We have seen a major rebound from the first quarter trauma of 2020, in new investment opportunities as well as deployment and valuation levels. Improvements in the underlying economy are feeding through into the financials of many underlying assets. We are also seeing increased competition for investments, placing pressure on returns, though these are still at attractive levels. Competition also means less time to close deals and makes it important to have the investment expertise, relationships and legal resources to move quickly. Of the multiple trends accelerated by the pandemic, two in particular stand out: digitization and decarbonization, with the latter also helping to increase the focus on environmental, governance and social (ESG) standards more broadly. The path of the pandemic itself remains a major focus, as positive news about vaccines vies with negative news about infection rates, shutdowns and challenges in vaccinating populations at scale. Digging into deployment High levels of dry powder in private asset classes put a spotlight on deployment rates. We expect the opportunity set to remain robust. Our sourcing funnel finished 2020 at around 90% of 2019 levels—noteworthy given the slowdown earlier in the year—and the momentum continues. In early December we asked a group of our senior investors in BAI what they expect their deployment levels to be in 2021. Over 80% of said they expect deployment to be the same or higher than forecasted pre-Covid. In private credit, for example, we expect to see more opportunities in restructuring and distressed situations, as the effects of shutdowns and structural shifts catch up with more companies. We also expect to see broader private credit markets continue to grow, as more companies (including some with access to public markets) seek the scale and flexibility of the capital now available from direct lenders. Deconstructing digitization The shift of activity into the virtual world is among the pandemic’s most profound effects. Even amid competition we continue to find private equity and credit opportunities in cloud computing companies (to name one example), in part by applying a sharper focus to business models and growth prospects. In real estate, we believe the burgeoning e-commerce market will continue to make the industrial logistics space a favorite. For our part, we are focused on last-mile distribution facilities, where high occupancies and rent growth may benefit logistics landlords. We see location as the main return driver—more so than property quality. In the US, for example, we like properties in the high-barrier and high-income coastal regions, such as Los Angeles and Northern New Jersey/New York. In infrastructure, meanwhile, data centers are evolving as an asset class. We see value in assets servicing large corporate counterparties on a contracted basis. We seek to mitigate risk by targeting data centers able to serve a diverse customer base within the more robust industry sectors, such as life sciences or business services. Recovery plays We have seen a broadening of deal types as economic uncertainty lessened in the second half of 2020, and we think this will continue. In real assets we expect investors to look beyond the sectors with Covid tailwinds to take advantage of cyclical recovery in sectors where valuations may have become overly pessimistic—for example, in regional airports. In credit, our private direct lending teams saw a shift from companies seeking liquidity buffers early in the crisis to companies funding growth into the recovery. This year we expect an increase in acquisition activity to boost demand for direct lending. In private equity last year, activity was concentrated in add-on acquisitions for portfolio companies, which are perceived to be a less risky strategy and accounted for more than 50% of transactions globally, according to Burgiss. This year we expect more interest in new platform companies, with ongoing appetite for exposure to sectors such as technology and healthcare contributing to the trend. An example is the recent acquisition of a private hospital chain in Europe. The attractive valuation reflected the stresses of the pandemic, and the sector is seen as needing consolidation to help smaller hospitals benefit from economies of scale. Downside risks and upside surprises Every outlook needs to look beyond base cases. On the downside, we are alert to: Setbacks in vaccine deployment and fighting the pandemic. Worse than expected damage from structural shifts—for example, in on-street retail or energy. The bill for stimulus, whether in higher taxes, inflation or both. Upside surprises on our radar include: Pent-up demand proves even greater than expected, and impaired sectors come back stronger. Unexpected momentum from uptake of 5G wireless. Major boost from robust US stimulus and public investment. In the US, we expect the policies of the incoming Biden administration to have significant effects on markets. In particular, we think an ambitious green agenda could significantly accelerate the global decarbonization trend, with consequences not just in energy, but in everything from real estate to manufacturing supply chains and beyond.

Credit markets are seeing greater demand globally in a low yield world, and investors are re-thinking portfolio design to incorporate higher allocations to both public and private credit. Lessons of 2020 Full year results across global credit markets last year masked the most significant and highly correlated selloff in recent history, followed by an impressive rebound from the March lows. The large scale and coordinated global monetary and fiscal policy actions materially changed the trajectory of credit performance last year.

Selectivity will be key Credit is supported by expectations for continued accommodative policies, vaccine development and deployment, an improving consumer and corporate sector, and a multi-year earnings recovery. However, spreads are near historic lows, and some deteriorating terms and transaction quality reinforce our increased focus on credit selection. What we expect We expect credit markets generally to deliver mid-single digit returns this year driven primarily by coupon income (carry) with spread tightening offset by modestly steeper yield curves. We believe accommodative global policy support and vaccine development and distribution will fuel pent up demand which should support an earnings recovery and lead to new investment and a multi-year expansion. Despite our overall constructive tone, investors should anticipate a wider range of outcomes across regions and sectors and focus on credit selection to create differentiated outcomes. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' The European private debt market is becoming increasingly established and mainstream. So, what shape will this more mature market take and what are the trends to watch over the medium term? Capital at risk. All financial investments involve an element of risk. Therefore, the value of the investment and the income from it will vary and the initial investment amount cannot be guaranteed. A Q&A with Stephan Caron The private debt market has grown rapidly in recent years, with investors increasingly allocating to private debt strategies in a bid to generate returns in a persistently low-yield environment. Yet, as signs emerge of an economic slowdown, can private debt funds continue to expand at the same rate? How will this affect lending conditions? And, following particularly robust growth in Europe, how will the industry settle and mature over the coming years? These are some of the issues we discussed with BlackRock managing director and head of European mid-market private debt, Stephan Caron. Q: European mid-market direct lending has expanded rapidly. What would you say are the most important recent developments? A: The market has certainly grown significantly. According to Deloitte, the annual growth rate was around 30 percent for the past five years. One of the biggest developments has been the emergence of a more pan-European opportunity set. While much of the initial growth was particularly UK-focused, we are now seeing healthy growth across Europe. Our experience is reflected in Deloitte’s data, showing that the UK still accounts for around 40 percent of European private debt transactions; France now accounts for 25 percent and Germany 11 percent. Germany is one of the fastest-growing markets in Europe and so it is likely to have a much greater share over the next few years. A recent report by GCA Altium showed that 50 percent of mid-market buyouts in Germany were financed with private debt – that’s up from just 16 percent in 2016, so it’s quite a shift. We’re also seeing growth in Benelux, Spain and Italy and early signs of development in the Nordics too. This is good news for investors, many of whom were concerned that their allocations were too heavily concentrated in the UK, where there are attractive opportunities but also a high degree of uncertainty. Our direct lending strategy has approximately 20 percent exposure to the UK, which is relatively low for a pan-European strategy but aligns with our investors’ conservative view on the UK and their desire for a high degree of geographical diversification. We have been able to meet those goals thanks to our strong local presence in European markets. To read the full Q&A, as featured in Private Debt Investor, click the link below. Download now '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Over the past 25 years or so, alternatives have evolved from a small part of the portfolios into a core holding.',\n",
       "  'content': \" Capital at risk. All financial investments involve an element of risk. Therefore, the value of the investment and the income from it will vary and the initial investment amount cannot be guaranteed. Mission critical People in finance often observe that “alternative” investments — so called because of the niche role they once played for investors — need a new name. Over the past 25 years or so, alternatives have evolved from a small part of the portfolios of the world’s largest investors into a core holding. As the graphic below shows, alternative investments — which include non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, private credit, real estate, infrastructure and more — represented just 5 percent of global pension portfolios in 1996. In 2019, they accounted for more than 25 percent. More alternatives in pension portfolios For these institutions, and the people who depend on them, this is a major development. At many pension funds, the performance of alternative investments now has a significant impact on the fund’s ability to keep its promises to the firefighters or teachers it serves. “It’s a mission-critical role, which raises an important question,” says Edwin Conway, global head of BlackRock Alternative Investors. “Given that these investments are often more complex than traditional ones, how do you develop the insights needed for good investment decisions and effective portfolio management?” What’s driving the change The growing prominence of alternative investments — most of which are private, as opposed to publicly listed stocks and bonds — reflects changes that have been underway in financial markets for decades. The population of public companies in the United States, for example, has declined nearly 40 percent since 1988, while the number of private companies with 500 or more employees has grown more than 50 percent. That gives investors looking to benefit from corporate growth a good reason to invest in private as well as public equity. Different investors have embraced alternatives to different degrees (insurers tend to own less, while endowments tend to own more) and for different sets of reasons. But the biggest motivation is the simplest: Investors need attractive risk-adjusted returns, ideally diversified away from the public markets. That may be particularly true now, as the bull market in equities enters its 11th year and investors wonder how long it can be sustained. “When your forward expectation for equities is falling, and you see that alternatives are attractive risk-adjusted assets, that becomes an interesting investment for you to own,” says Jim Barry, Chief Investment Officer of BlackRock Alternative Investors. But if alternatives offer a potential premium to traditional investments, the premium comes with its own set of challenges. For one thing, the sustained popularity of alternatives has elevated prices in many segments of the market, making a disciplined approach to investing in them more important than ever. Investors also need to take account of the multi-year time periods of investments such as private equity and infrastructure. It makes sense for long-term investors like pension funds to tie up a portion of their money in exchange for appropriate compensation, but managing liquidity needs and maintaining holdings at desired levels is inevitably more complicated than it is with stocks and bonds. There’s no shortage of decisions to be made. “With alts you have to get two things right,” says Pam Chan, CFA, who invests across the spectrum of alternatives as global head and C.I.O. of BlackRock Alternative Solutions. “First, top-down, what part of the alternative investment landscape do you want to invest in? Is it private equity, private credit, infrastructure, real estate or other niche private market asset classes? Where is there relative value, and how does a given investment help you achieve your specific goal?” “Second, there’s the question of who you want to invest with and how they ‘manufacture’ investments bottom-up,” Chan adds. “There’s historically a much bigger difference between the top performers and the bottom ones within the private markets than in public markets.” Given this wider range of potential results, a dollar invested in alternatives has a higher marginal impact on portfolio performance than a dollar invested in public markets. Indeed, an average pension fund with 26 percent of its portfolio in alternatives may see that slice influence overall results nearly as much as the 74 percent in public market investments. See the graphic below. A higher marginal impact on portfolio performance “Performance dispersion” is the industry’s term for some managers doing better than others, and it’s not hard to see why there’s more dispersion in alternative investing. “Given the complexity inherent in alternative investments,” Barry explains, “there’s more for managers to get right — or wrong.” This greater challenge, and the skills and resources needed to navigate it, is often seen as the main reason why private assets potentially offer a return premium over public ones. Not least among the necessary skills and resources is the ability to look beneath the hood and understand the mechanics that drive these investments. Public markets are brimming with data. Just turn on CNBC and you’ll get an earful. Information in private markets is (no surprise) harder to come by, yet no less essential for good decision-making. Investors need visibility on the risks each investment entails, on whether the potential returns are commensurate with those risks and on how much those risks overlap with the ones posed by other investments in the portfolio. So what’s the goal here? As investors increase their holdings of alternative investments, they are demanding more information so they can evaluate them independently and integrate them within their portfolios. And while they retain their interest in higher returns, they are also thinking about the other things alternatives can do for their portfolios. Diversification, always a key benefit, is probably becoming an even more important motivation. At a time when public markets are growing more volatile, the fact that alternatives don’t move up and down in lockstep with stocks or bonds is an attractive feature. At the same time, a larger and more varied roster of alternative investments makes it possible for investors to choose the ones that will help them achieve the specific goal they’re pursuing without taking on more risk than they need to. While some investors are focused almost entirely on growth, many others need a mix of growth and income and, often, a hedge against inflation. Today’s expanded alternatives lineup offers choices to target all of the above. The graphic below shows how a hypothetical portfolio designed to seek income might differ from one designed to seek growth. It's all in the mix Fitting in With alternatives making up a greater share of the portfolio and linking more directly to the investor’s overall objectives, it becomes increasingly important to scrutinize them side by side with traditional investments. “When people think about investing, they've traditionally thought about investing in equities, investing in bonds, investing in alternatives,” says Mark Everitt, CFA, the head of investment research and strategy for BlackRock Alternative Investors. “But more and more, alternatives can be considered as part of your general equity allocation or your general credit allocation in the bond part of your portfolio.” What does it take to accomplish this? Above all, more visibility on the underlying sources of risk and return in alternatives. “Better data, and the ability to analyze it, are a major part of our focus here at BlackRock,” says Everitt. “We’ve brought a lot of clarity and ease of use to public markets, and we’re now doing the same in private markets. It’s what our clients need.” Financial markets are always evolving, and alternatives are no exception. “Growing pains are inevitable,” Conway says, “and it’s important for investors to think of the next decade as well as the next economic cycle.” Over that time period, these investments are likely to see a steady expansion of the role they play in portfolios as well as in the broader economy. They might even get a new name. It’s already several years overdue. \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Read about why we think stubbornly low interest rates challenge long-held assumptions about the role government bonds play in strategic asset allocations.',\n",
       "  'content': ' The resumption of central bank easing and the plunge of bond yields to historic lows earlier this year amount to a paradigm shift that is challenging the role of some government bonds in strategic asset allocations (SAAs). Expectations that interest rates would gradually rise as monetary policy normalised have been swiftly replaced by worries that interest rates in regions such as the euro area and Japan are hovering around what we perceive as their prevailing lower bound. The role of government bonds as portfolio ballast is particularly under pressure, in our view, in these regions. At the same time, our conviction in US Treasuries’ ability to provide ballast in risk-off episodes has increased. We believe this environment forces a rethink of the starting point for government bond allocations. China’s vast government bond market offers a strategic opportunity in this context. We introduce return expectations for Chinese assets in our capital market assumptions (CMAs) that allow us to incorporate them in our investor-specific SAAs. Rethinking government bond allocations The dramatic drop in government bond yields this year, taking nearly a third of global bonds into negative-yielding territory at one point, has raised serious questions about their role in a portfolio. Low rates are not a new story. Yet the sharp about-turn on expectations that monetary policy was poised to normalise and set interest rates on a path higher challenges the role of government bonds as portfolio ballast where interest rates are near a perceived ELB, notably the euro area and Japan. At the same time, our conviction in our strategic overweight on higher-yielding US Treasuries has increased. High risk, no incomeDuration and volatility of 30-year government bonds, November 2019 Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream, November 2019. Notes: The left panel shows the “Dollar Duration” of hypothetical 30-year German bund priced at par with annual coupons varying from 0% to 8%. Dollar duration measures the dollar change in a bond’s value for a change in the market interest rate. It is a measure of the time it takes to receive half the cash flows of a bond, weighted by the present value of each of the cash flows. The lower the coupon, the longer the duration as proportionately less payment is received before final maturity. For zero coupon bonds, the duration will be equal to its maturity. The right panel shows a plot of the duration and computed expected annualized volatility for all bonds in the ICE-BofAML Treasury Master Index, calculated on BlackRock Aladdin as of August 30th, 2019. We break each bond into factor exposures (duration) and analyse historical volatilities over the past 18 years. The yellow shaded box marks the range of long-term expected volatility for global equity markets with MSCI World as the index proxy. Risks tied to how close interest rates are to their ELBs have important portfolio construction implications, particularly for holders of euro area government bonds where these risks are most acute, in our view. First, we believe the return contribution of bonds - via income or capital return - is very low. Second, the negative stock-bond correlation that underpins government bonds’ ballast properties starts to crack as policy rates – and by extension bond yields – approach their perceived ELBs. Another potential consequence of negative government bond yields: An increase in zero-coupon bond issuance. This saps crucial income for pension and insurance funds. Bond mathematics also dictate that zero-coupon bonds would be longer duration than bonds with coupons and therefore exhibit equity-like volatility as the shaded area on the above shows. The sensitivity of the bond prices to changes in interest rates increases with duration. Adapting to a low-yield world The challenges brought by bond yields getting closer to their ELBs are serious enough to warrant a rethink of the neutral starting point, or benchmark, for government bond allocations. This is no trivial task because there is not a completely satisfactory approach, in our view. A different starting point Government bond allocations in our hypothetical unconstrained portfolio vs a market cap-weighted benchmark, 2019 Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future results.

Notes: The charts show how our government bond allocations in a hypothetical unconstrained, US-dollar based portfolio on a 10-year horizon stack up against an allocation based purely on a market-cap weighting. The market-cap weighting is calculated on BlackRock’s Aladdin as of November 6, 2019. The left chart shows only the fixed income part of our unconstrained portfolio, scaled up to 100. The tilts shown on the panel the far-right panel shows the relative tilts after running our robust optimisation on our CMAs and incorporating our views that euro area and Japanese government bonds are less desirable given their diminished ballast properties. We take a pragmatic approach of determining a government bond allocation that combines our expected returns with a recognition that some government bond markets, especially in the core euro area, may be closer to their perceived ELBs than other markets. We illustrate our work in the charts above. The chart on the left shows the government bond allocation within a multi-asset portfolio derived from a weighting based on market cap. The chart on the right shows the results of our approach. We are overweight government bonds in aggregate (see our unconstrained portfolio tilts on our CMA interactive website). Yet within that allocation, we recommend investors cut allocations to the euro area, hold more US Treasuries and make room for Chinese government bonds thanks to their potential returns and diversification benefits. Launching our Chinese equity and bond expected returns Our latest work around navigating ultra-low interest rates coincides with the launch of our expected returns for Chinese equities and bonds. Near-term risks to China’s economy, particularly surrounding geopolitical and trade frictions with the U.S., have prompted a cautious stance among global investors towards the country’s assets. Yet we see a strategic case for holding Chinese assets in portfolios that goes beyond tactical considerations. Our views on Chinese assets are not driven solely by the assumption that higher economic growth results in better expected returns. Instead, as for all other regions, they stem from fundamental considerations such as the outlook for interest rates, valuations and the path of returns.

Our new CMAs for Chinese asset returns allow us think about allocating to China in a whole-portfolio context rather than relying on index weights that will be shaped by other factors. We allow for a wide range of uncertainty in our return expectations to account for the multiple ways that China’s economy can evolve. Our base case is for a gradual growth slowdown in coming years, in line with IMF forecasts. Our growth expectations are based on a bottom-up approach featuring inputs on labour, capital and total factor productivity. A breakdown of Chinese growth – historic and projected – based on these inputs is shown in the chart above. We see growth decelerating below a 6% annual rate in coming years and eventually below 5% as the ageing population starts to drag as shown towards the right of the chart below. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'COVID-19 has dominated healthcare conversations for two years. Equity investor Erin Xie explores the broader landscape and opportunities post-pandemic.',\n",
       "  'content': \" Healthcare conversations over the past two years have focused almost exclusively on COVID-19. Yet the dynamic and diverse sector offers a lot more to talk about. BlackRock’s Erin Xie and Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks did just that in a recent dialogue. The response from pharmaceutical companies to the COVID-19 pandemic was epic. But has it distracted from or amplified the broader opportunities and innovation within the healthcare sector? In a recent video, Dr. Erin Xie, Head of the Health Science team within BlackRock Fundamental Equities, and David Ricks, CEO of pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, discuss the future of healthcare after COVID, the question of regulation, and whether dented valuations present a buying opportunity. Playing catch-up after COVID COVID cases are ebbing and government restrictions have been lifted across much of the developed world, prompting Dr. Xie to pose the biggest question of all: How might this pandemic evolve? Mr. Ricks’ view: The endemic phase is near. “The virus is migrating in a way viruses do. They become more infectious and less virulent,” he explains. “But at some point, it will be a seasonal coronavirus that we'll talk about for the rest of our lives.” Mr. Ricks credits the progress to the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments. “We’re here two years in, which is a very short time scale for development and discovery of new medicines and vaccines,” he says. “Although the variant evolution continues, the viral drift occurs … many of these solutions retain their effectiveness.” As the pandemic wanes, Dr. Xie believes innovation across the pharmaceutical sector can accelerate, especially in biotechnology ― an area that uses material from living organisms to create medicines. Dr. Xie sees exciting developments coming in the treatment of cancer, immunology, genetic and neurodegenerative diseases. She finds attractive opportunities primarily in small- and mid-cap biotech companies with innovative pipelines and strong product results. “I think the science is actually moving a lot faster than a few years ago,” she says, providing hope that it manifests in drug development. Beyond biotech, Dr. Xie sees med-tech offering investors opportunities to capitalize on innovation. While the healthcare sector has been slow to embrace technological change, the momentum is beginning to shift. This should lead to progress in areas such as precision surgical tools and minimally invasive procedures, as well as the growing trend of wearable tech and connected devices such as glucose monitoring systems. The question of regulation Dr. Xie asks whether the pharmaceuticals industry will get political credit for helping to hasten the end of the pandemic, and whether the thorny question of regulation ― for example around drug pricing ― should remain an investor concern. Mr. Ricks credits a “positive pricing environment in the U.S.” with allowing the rapid development of vaccines and COVID treatments: “For decades in advance, we built up a massive industrial infrastructure around antibody, small-molecule manufacturing, RNA therapeutics that were meant for other purposes. And that investment thesis was redirected to COVID.” Yet he notes some policy changes would be welcome to benefit patients, pointing to a “broken reimbursement system” where some patients still bear high costs for their medicines. Dr. Xie agrees that major regulatory reform is unlikely but certain government policy changes are necessary ― and could even provide a boost to the healthcare sector by removing some of the longstanding “political overhang” that has contributed to investor trepidation. A view on valuations The fear of regulatory action and potential for it to dent profit margins is one reason healthcare stocks are available at a discount to the market. See the chart below. Biotech stocks especially have struggled over the past 12 months amid little progress in the clinical development of new treatments (COVID-19 successes aside). A sector “on sale”Healthcare stocks are trading at a discount to the market Source: BlackRock Fundamental Equities, as of March 31, 2022. Figures shown reflect the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the broad market as represented by the MSCI World Index versus the healthcare sector and biotechnology components in it. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Other areas sport loftier valuations, making selectivity in the healthcare sector key. Mr. Ricks identifies delivery systems for gene and RNA therapies, for example, as “very hot.” Longer-term, Dr. Xie sees the sector well supported by the continuation of secular growth drivers. Aging societies mean that demand for healthcare products and services is poised to grow for decades to come. \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The pandemic put the healthcare sector front and center in 2020 and 2021 as development of therapies and vaccines to combat COVID-19 got underway.',\n",
       "  'content': ' 2021 healthcare review The global healthcare sector (represented by the Russell 3000 HealthCare Index) returned +19.8% in 2021, highlighting positive growth in the context of a volatile equity market. However, not all industries and companies were created equal. This year brought significantly higher dispersion of returns between various industries, as well as different market capitalization segments, with the clear winners being COVID-19 beneficiaries. Overall, areas more sensitive to impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, including medtech elective procedures, next generation service providers and telemedicine companies experienced heightened volatility and weaker returns during the period. In addition, broad market uncertainty led to a flight to safety away from risky assets and in favor of large, quality companies. Healthcare companies with market caps below $10billion delivered on average negative returns in 2021. Life sciences companies, primarily providing technological tools and software for increased efficiency as well as research services, were strong winners during the year. The industry benefited from increased technological adoption and heightened demand for clinical services. In the healthcare providers space, hospitals and lab testing companies experienced strong returns, largely due to increased demand as a result of COVID-19. The managed care industry, primarily composed of large, U.S.-based insurance providers, experienced positive momentum on the back of the quality and value factor market rotation. Elsewhere in the industry, home health companies and value-based primary care providers experienced significant drawdowns during the year. The companies were negatively impacted by increased COVID-related costs, lower than anticipated adoption and the growth-to-value rotation that affected many 2020 strong stock performers. Returns within the pharmaceuticals sector were strong but concentrated, with three companies, Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson, driving about 91% of the returns this year in the Russell 3000 HealthCare Index. Both Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson benefited from the FDA emergency approval and subsequent deployment of their COVID-19 vaccines. Eli Lilly soared on the strength of their COVID-19 antibody treatment as well as an anticipated upcoming approval of their Alzheimer’s drug. The medical devices and supplies space also experienced heightened dispersion during the year, with COVID-19 diagnostic and testing companies posting the strongest returns. Results amongst the elective procedure segment were largely mixed, with larger, diversified quality companies delivering solid growth. Companies developing hospital tools, medical supplies and remote monitoring devices also returned positively. The biotechnology industry experienced the greatest weakness during 2021, with the equal weighted S&P Select Biotechnology Index posting -20% returns. The industry experienced a sharp reversal from 2020 highs, likely driven by factor rotations in the market, as well as lackluster clinical progress outside of COVID-19 during the period. Stripping out COVID-19 vaccine developer Moderna, which returned a staggering 143% in 2021, left the industry with approximately flat returns during the period. A slowdown in M&A activity amidst increased regulatory scrutiny and clinical safety setbacks in areas like gene therapy have also contributed to dampening sentiment. Given the riskier characteristics of early stage biotechnology companies, market sentiment shifted out of favor for the industry, even in cases of positive clinical development. Overall, 2021 brought increased dispersion and volatility across the healthcare sector, creating pockets of opportunity for 2022. 2021 healthcare returns by industry weight & market cap Source: FactSet as of December 31st, 2021. Sub-sectors are constituents of the Russell 3000 HealthCare Index. 2022 outlook mRNA vaccines Vaccines that target the spike protein found on the novel coronavirus using genetically engineered mRNA were a new class of inoculations approved during 2021. These jabs, primarily developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, saw high efficacy rates and wide adoption in the U.S. and across the developed world. Praised not only for their impressive results but also for the velocity of development, scientists are looking to use the mRNA modality to approach infectious diseases in the future, including malaria, influenza, sexually-transmitted diseases and cancer. mRNA therapies are likely to see continued clinical development in oncology over the next few years, as scientists attempt to leverage the modality of training the human immune system to fight specific identifiers in order to target tumor and cancerous cells. The versatility of genetically engineered mRNA is likely to usher in a new wave of medical innovation over the next decade. Diagnostics In March 2020, the FDA granted emergency approval to the first ever CRISPR-applied product, a COVID-19 diagnostic test that revealed results in under an hour. A year later, dozens of different diagnostic solutions have been developed by leading medtech companies, among them Abbott Labs, Danaher, Becton Dickinson and Thermo Fisher. From 10-minute blood tests to at-home rapid antigen swabs, testing companies have continued to innovate in 2021, in order to provide increasingly efficient and accurate COVID-19 tests. We anticipate that demand for COVID-19 diagnostic tests is likely to persist in the near-term on the back of the emergence of new virus variants. Antiviral oral treatments The second half of 2021 brought a welcome advance in the fight against the pandemic: the development of efficacious antiviral oral treatments for COVID-19. First announced by Merck & Co and subsequently launched by Pfizer, these treatments have the potential to significantly reduce mortality in patients sick with the virus, helping prevent severe illness and keeping hospitalizations at a manageable rate. Originally developed in the early 2000’s to treat influenza, Merck’s molnupivarir faced regulatory scrutiny after announcing that the drug was not as efficacious as originally expected. In contrast, Pfizer’s Paxlovid, a protease inhibitor drug, was found to reduce the risk of hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients by 89%. Despite the incessant focus of the healthcare industry on addressing COVID-19, there is also significant scientific progress outside of the current pandemic. Oncology The field of cancer treatments continued to expand at a rapid pace in 2021, despite record low rates of utilization. Patient hesitation to visit hospitals during the pandemic has led to significantly lower rates of diagnoses, with early 2021 rates still 26-51% below pre-pandemic levels. The impact of these delayed detections will likely continue to play out in the years to come. From a development perspective, breakthroughs in immune modulation are leading to record-levels of efficacy, with 17 novel cancer treatments approved for use globally in 2020 (16 of these designated as orphan drugs for rare cancers). Innovative treatments continue to be concentrated in smaller-capped companies, with nearly 80% of early-stage pipelines and 66% of late-stage pipelines being developed by emerging biopharma companies.1 CAR T-Cell therapies, a revolutionary oncotherapy, continued to expand in 2021, with approved treatments currently targeting lymphoma and leukemia now becoming increasingly accessible in the U.S.. Alzheimer’s 2021 marked a milestone in the fight against Alzheimer’s with the FDA approval of Biogen and Eisai’s drug Aduhelm earlier this year. The drug and other biosimilars continue a controversial and volatile road ahead faced with regulatory scrutiny and hurdles in commercial adoption. Medtech Medical devices continue to see significant progress, with advancements ranging from portable MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machines, ACL (anterior cruciate ligament)-healing tools and Alzheimer’s blood-based diagnostics, among others. We are likely to see continued innovation in this space, from precision surgical tools and minimally-invasive procedures, to the growing trend of wearable tech and connected devices, like continuous glucose monitoring systems. Technology in healthcare Despite the innovation developed within the sector, there is still a long way to go in the use of technology to improve products and services. In particular, the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical trials, gene mapping and robotic-assisted surgery is increasing. We are also seeing AI and software innovations in electronic records, personalized insurance plans and next-gen healthcare provider services. Early adopters of AI tools in clinical development have cited the ability of machine learning algorithms to identify biomarkers and learn about new diseases 30% faster than human pathologists. Given the average go-to-market rate of 5-10 years for new drugs, experts are hopeful that technology like AI can speed up drug discovery and development. 2 1IQVIA Institute: Global Oncology Trends, June 2021 2 BioSpace, December 2021 Reference to the names of the companies mentioned is for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice or an investment recommendation of the companies. Despite dampening sentiment on China investments in 2021, we continue to view the country as a long-term growth opportunity in healthcare, particularly as the government invests in the development of an innovative domestic biopharma industry. On the back of continued regulatory uncertainty, we remain neutral on sentiment in the country today, with a preference in risk-managed opportunities, such as contract research organizations, that benefit from secular demand for clinical trials and services, which we believe are likely to see organic growth in the next few years. We maintain exposure to biopharma companies in select, high-conviction opportunities. Valuations today for the healthcare sector remain very attractive and well below the long-run average, with FY1 P/E ratios currently at a 20% discount to broad equity markets (represented by the Russell 3000 Index). Certain industries, such as biotechnology, appear particularly attractive, with a FY1 P/E discount of 51% versus broad equity markets. We remain selectively optimistic in this industry, particularly in the small- and mid-cap segment of the market, with a focus on innovative pipelines and strong product results.

       "  'abstract': 'As we embark on Healthcare’s next chapter, we share key learnings from the pandemic for CFOs to consider as they navigate the path forward.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Throughout the pandemic America\\'s healthcare institutions have faced shocks to operations, disruption of revenue, sharp rises in costs and waves of uncertainty. For many hospitals, these issues were intertwined with a difficult investment landscape and volatile markets. Meanwhile, the past two years have underscored the social determinants of healthcare, healthcare inequity and how essential public health is. Strong balance sheets and federal relief programs helped most hospitals withstand both the healthcare delivery and financial crisis of the pandemic, but hospital margins continue to be crunched and remain below 2019 levels. As new technologies and treatments promise to improve the healthcare experience dramatically, higher costs—brought on by workforce shortages and rising supply prices—continue to exert pressure on hospital financials and drive CFOs to unlock new sources of resiliency. We’ve identified three key learnings for CFOs to consider for liquidity and investment strategy as they navigate this complex environment. Bigger bang for your buck Most CFOs would agree that a sharp market downturn – like we experienced in February and March of 2020 – would constitute a stress event that puts temporary downward pressure on Days Cash on Hand (DCOH). If it’s a protracted market downturn – like we experienced in the Global Financial Crisis – that pressure could turn to credit rating concerns. However, a less obvious enterprise stress is having an investment strategy that is not keeping with inflation, not exceeding the cost of capital, or not generating enough growth to support future capital expenditures. The healthcare crisis forced some organizations to re-underwrite enterprise priorities and their targets for them. These conversations among management and Boards have not been easy. There are those who want to manage liquidity, limit volatility and avoid scrutiny by rating agencies or bond buyers. And there are those who want to pursue growth, seize opportunities and tolerate downside risks. To drive a constructive debate and decisions around questions like how much investment – and enterprise risk to take, we advocate choosing one, two or three key metrics that everyone understands are material to the organization and are sensitive to the strategic choices made in the investment portfolio. They tend to be the obvious and important ones, like DCOH or Cash to Long Term Debt, but less so obvious ones like Net Asset Volatility. While every hospital has its unique blend of challenges and objectives, insights into how peer organizations are positioned for investment strategy, investment risk and these key metrics can help provide context. Our annual Healthcare Peer Risk Study, which examined the allocations of 30 U.S.-based hospitals and health systems, showed an average enterprise portfolio expected risk of about 9%. That means that stakeholders should expect a dollar invested at the start of the year to end the year within a range of $0.91 to $1.09. Predictably, organizations that were able to bring liquidity levels down to near pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2020, and those with higher allocations to growth assets like public equity and alternatives, land on the higher end of the risk range. We also found that organizations that take on more risk tend to have more DCOH. Higher DCOH gives organizations greater financial flexibility and gives CFOs confidence to take more investment risk, much of which is attributed to higher returning, less liquid asset classes, like private equity. Those higher returning assets drive higher DCOH, creating a virtuous circle of growth. Source: Days Cash on Hand (DCOH) is calculated as total cash & investment assets in scope divided by operating expense less depreciation and amortization expense over 365. Financial statement data used for each system was sourced from Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Reports. Risk Source: BlackRock, as of June 2021. Ex-ante risk is defined as annual expected volatility and is calculated using data derived from portfolio holdings, using the Aladdin portfolio risk model. This proprietary multi-factor model can be applied across multiple asset classes to analyze the impact of different characteristics of securities on their behaviors in the market place. In analyzing risk factors, the Aladdin portfolio risk model attempts to capture and monitor these attributes that can influence the risk/return behavior of a particular security/asset. Risk: Monthly Constant Weighted (MTC model) with 248 monthly observations; 1 standard deviation; 1yr horizon. For details regarding the indexes used to represent each asset class, see the “Capital Market and Modeling Assumptions\" Exhibit A at the end of this analysis. Finding the “goldilocks zone” for liquidity At the onset of the pandemic, hospitals generally averted a liquidity crisis by issuing debt, opening lines of credit and briefly pausing reinvestments and/or new commitments. CARES grants, Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS) advances and other government aid also helped. Two years later, organizations are still trying to find their goldilocks zone for liquidity. Many organizations have held more cash to buffer operating volatility. While operating cash levels still remained elevated at 2021 fiscal year ends, rapidly rising salaries and expenses – and a lingering pandemic – are now pressuring operating margins and cash flows. Some organizations have had to draw down this excess cash, and then some to meet near-term obligations. Organizations that hold too much cash are paying a steep opportunity cost. Among the institutions in our study, we estimate that the most conservative investors are leaving between six and eight cents of potential return on the table for every dollar they hold in cash, which has been earning next to nothing. Considering that cash takes up 15-30% of enterprise assets, those unrealized returns add up quickly. Living with inflation The recent spike in inflation has impacted both operations (rising costs for labor, supplies and other needs) and investments via eroding preserving purchasing power and dragging on growth. The impact is real. According to our analysis, a scenario in which inflation and interest rates surge would cause an almost 10% asset drawdown for the average healthcare institution, resulting in a DCOH decline of 29 days. Some institutions would experience a drawdown of as much as 13%. Risk: 84% confidence interval, constant weighted monthly observations; 1yr horizon Historical scenarios simulate each plan’s current portfolio through historical time periods. Hypothetical scenarios simulate each plan’s current portfolio through hypothetical large market shocks and geopolitical stresses, with implied shocks. The performance shown is hypothetical, does not represent the performance of any existing portfolio, and does not reflect fees and expenses; if fees and expenses were included, the performance would be lower.

       "  'content': ' Overview As central banks reduce fiscal stimulus measures and inflation concerns abound, many investors are turning to floating-rate investments. Unlike other fixed income investments which are sensitive to changes in underlying risk-free rates, floating rate instruments provide an income based on credit-spread alone. This lack of interest rate sensitivity further provides protection against inflation as compared to other asset classes and fixed income sectors. Typically, investors will access floating rate credit instruments in 3 main ways: Leveraged Loans, Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs), or Direct Lending. Though differences remain in liquidity and structure, the underlying market for direct and syndicated lending has converged in recent years. Understanding the similarities and differences between these investments can provide valuable insight into how these instruments may complement or substitute for each other in times where their floating-rate nature is particularly attractive – namely in periods of rising rates and/or inflation. Defining types of floating rate instruments Leveraged Loans, also known as Bank Loans or Broadly Syndicated Loans, are debt instruments issued by companies rated below investment grade and are typically senior secured debt, meaning they sit at the top of a company’s capital structure. For Leveraged Loans, banks typically provide revolving credit under a syndicated loan agreement, meaning a group of lenders undertakes the process of arranging the loan which is then syndicated (or sold) to other investors. Credit rating agencies will typically provide quality ratings to loans as they would fixed rate bonds. Structured vehicles known as Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) are set up to hold and manage different pools of Leveraged Loans or Middle Market Loans. CLOs are financed with several tranches of debt and equity with descending seniority, allowing investors to gain levered exposure to a pool of diversified loans. Rating agencies will similarly provide ratings for each tranche of the CLO, dependent on both the structure and the underlying loan collateral. While companies transacting in syndicated High Yield or Leveraged Loan markets may obtain financing with the help of a bank or intermediary, in private markets companies may access financing directly through lenders. Essentially, private credit lending happens on a bilateral, negotiated basis where lenders partner with borrowers to create bespoke solutions rather than through bank intermediaries. While some investment vehicles that hold private credit (such as closed end funds) may be structured to obtain a credit rating, typically these loans are not reviewed by credit rating agencies. As they are privately negotiated, Middle Market Loans are also typically associated with more flexibility to negotiate terms, covenants and pricing, while allowing lenders to take an active role should a borrower experience challenges. Comparing floating rate instruments Aggregate estimates on private lending can often widely vary by source, and while CLOs are highly transparent liquid vehicles, aggregated asset class statistics can be less accessible in some cases than for Leveraged Loans or High Yield. Nevertheless, we have attempted to compare these asset classes on some basic characteristics that may be important in evaluating their investment. Liquidity The starkest difference between public and private loans is liquidity and ability to trade in secondary markets. Importantly, while Leveraged Loans and CLO tranches trade in daily liquid markets, Direct Lending typically has multi-year lock up periods. Leveraged Loans: Leveraged Loans can be accessed in the primary or secondary market and can be considered daily liquid, though they are subject to longer settlement. CLOs: In addition to primary issuance – which nearly doubled from 2020 to 20211 – secondary trading of CLO tranches is split between bilateral over-the-counter trading and secondary auctions, by a mechanism called BWIC (Bid Wanted in Competition). Direct Lending: Given that Middle Market Loans are bespoke, they are not typically tradeable in the secondary market without legal and pricing hurdles. Private credit investment funds and Middle Market Loans typically have terms of 4-6 years, although in the current market environment, performing Middle Market Loans are often refinanced prior to their stated maturity. That being said, the underlying loans can be structured into vehicles with varying levels of liquidity such as BDCs (Business Development Companies) that trade on exchanges similar to closed end funds, interval funds or private funds. 2021 trading volume by asset class Source: FINRA, LSTA, BlackRock as of 12/31/2021.

US CLOs volume is an internal BlackRock estimate based on reported BWIC volumes as of 12/31/2021. Risk/return profile As compensation for illiquidity and complexity, it’s expected that Middle Market Loans should provide a premium relative to Leveraged Loans or publicly traded High Yield. Additionally, private investments are typically marked on a quarterly rather than daily basis, which has led to less reported volatility than Leveraged Loans even with similar underlying credit characteristics. Broadly, however, both Middle Market Loans and Leveraged Loans have exhibited less volatility than High Yield bonds while having relatively high correlations both to each other and to interest-rate sensitive below investment grade bonds. Since CLOs are structured to create tranches with specified ratings, the risk return data can vary between investment grade and below-investment grade. However, each of these asset classes have high correlations to each other given similar underlying credit risk. 10-year risk/return (as of 12/31/21) Source: BlackRock, Barclays, S&P/LCD, JP Morgan, and Cliffwater as of 12/31/2021.

Credit ratings While Leveraged Loans are typically secured, single-B rated loans make up a larger portion of the market than in US High Yield. Direct Lending, as a private investment, is often not rated unless included in a Middle Market CLO. CLOs, importantly, are structured such that tranches achieve specific ratings though the underlying loans may have varying ratings characteristics which can be particularly attractive for investors looking to achieve higher credit ratings while accessing below investment grade credit risk.

Morgan and weightings reflect par amount per rating tranche divided by total par amount outstanding for the J.P. Morgan CLOIE index. Credit ratings shown as reported by the respective index provider. Market size and composition The Leveraged Loan market has grown substantially in recent years and is now nearly equal in size to the High Yield market, partially due to growth in the CLO market. While estimates for Direct Lending can vary widely, the market has also experienced similar high growth trend. Importantly, within the High Yield and Leveraged Loan markets, we typically witness larger deal sizes, whereas Direct Lending deals are typically smaller due to the size of companies making up this less transparent portion of the overall market. Within the Direct Lending and Leveraged Loan markets, we also witness a much higher level of sponsor backed issues, with an estimated 85% and 50% of deals being led by private equity firms, respectively. Compare this to the estimated 20% of sponsored deals in the High Yield market and one can see that allocations to either Leveraged Loans or Direct Lending can be a beneficial way to add indirect private equity exposure to a portfolio. For CLOs, the average tranche size is determined as part of the structuring, and while the number of underlying issuers will be similar to the overall loan market, the number of managers who structure CLOs over the last decade has grown from 82 to 135 in the last five years5.

Sector composition Finally, when looking at sector composition, there are notable differences between the High Yield Bonds, Leveraged Loan, CLO and Direct Lending markets. Importantly, industry composition within each of these floating rate markets tends to exhibit similar trends with relatively high concentrations within the electronics, business equipment & services and healthcare sectors. High Yield Bonds, in contrast, have lower exposure to each of these sectors and much higher concentration in oil & gas names as many energy companies cannot issue a Leveraged Loan given existing revolving credit facilities that prohibit issuing debt that is paired within the capital structure.

       "  'content': ' Rob Kapito, President at BlackRock, and Charles Hatami, Global Head of the Financial Institutions Group and Financial Markets Advisory, were joined by Tim Boroughs, CIO of Chubb Group, for a moderated discussion to explore themes that are currently driving momentum within the industry, including: risk appetite is increasing, sustainability continues to be embedded in the investment process, and technology is seen as a driver of transformation. Markets will continue to challenge insurers in 2022. Inflation will be a major concern as employers struggle to pay and find workers. This could lead to an immediate impact on everything from food prices to energy and wages. While there is currently over USD$40 trillion in cash that is earning zero, or in some circumstances, negative interest, investors will continue to face more market competition in search of yield. And while some are hoping for the Fed and Central Banks to provide relief in markets, many of the policies have been slow or misplaced. As insurers look to expand their risk appetite, we see diversification across asset classes and geography as real drivers for portfolio reallocation. Liquidity management is also becoming more prominent across the industry. In the 2021 BlackRock Global Insurance Report, 60% of insurers who were surveyed said they plan to increase their investment risk exposure over the next two years. This large increase in risk is not a matter of preference, but rather a necessity due to the continuant low interest rate environment and the relative return of higher yielding fixed income and alternatives relative to treasuries. As insurers look to expand their risk appetite, many are now turning to the private equity space, particularly within tech and healthcare, where the markets are constantly changing and growing. Some investors are also turning to infrastructure, which can provide long duration securities that make an impact, as well as in real estate, particularly in structures and areas of the world where they see the most opportunities. Due to the nature of their business, insurers inherently understand how climate change can affect their clients. The transition to a clean economy is not an issue of value and norms but is rather a response to science, economics, and regulation. And as asset owners, insurers play an important role in the transition to net zero. Many insurers are looking to be more opportunistic and proactive at investing in the energy transition because achieving their sustainability objectives is not about divestment, but rather about increasing investments. As a result, many insurers plan on increasing their allocations to sustainable investments by nearly 30% over the next two years. While going from brown to green assets can’t happen overnight, it becomes more of a reality as society begins to transition from brown to less brown assets. However, this is only possible if the technology and data are available for insurers to effectively measure and report ESG commitments and reward companies who are effectively practicing it. '},\n",

Following a +2.7% funded ratio gain in 2020 (including a +13.8% rebound from March 2020 lows), the average plan is now 99.3% funded on a PBO basis as shown below – the highest level since the 2008/09 financial crisis and well within sight of being fully funded. Average PBO funded ratio up +11.1% in 2021 (not including contributions) Source: BlackRock U.S. Pension Funding Update In this paper, our fourth annual corporate pension themes publication, we encourage all U.S. corporate plans to begin thinking beyond fully funded across four dimensions: Glidepath design: Fully funded does not mean fully de-risked Portfolio construction: Asset classes for a de-risked portfolio Implementation: The ubiquitous importance of daily monitoring, technology, and expanding the implementation toolkit End-game solutions: Forward planning is critical We also provide an update on a variety of plan sponsor-driven initiatives that we have touched on in prior themes publications such as closing or freezing the plan, making voluntary contributions, borrowing to fund at low yields, and seizing the sustainability opportunity which may further help progress toward funded ratio goals. Download full report Glidepath design: fully funded does not mean fully de-risked Being 100% funded on a PBO basis typically does not mean the asset allocation is fully de-risked with 100% of the assets in a liability driven investment (“LDI”) program. There are two main reasons why this is the case: The ‘end-state’ PBO funded ratio target is usually above 100%, at say 105% or higher to account for potential mismatches in actuarial assumptions vs actual experience (e.g. demographics, mortality, wages, lump-sum take rates, and plan expenses), disconnects in asset performance vs liabilities where the latter is not subject to downgrade or default risk , and potential premiums in the event of a future pension risk transfer (“PRT”) to an insurance company; and Plans at 100% funded, even frozen plans with no future benefit accruals, often have liability growth rates or ‘hurdle rates’ which exceed the return available from a 100% LDI portfolio (as proxied by U.S. Long Credit bonds) which would result in a funded ratio decline over time. Fully funded does not mean fully de-risked, particularly if the plan is still accruing benefits and/or the sponsor is not contributing Hurdle rates are still well above the expected return from long bonds at 100% PBO funded Source: BlackRock. Hurdle rates reflect the required asset return to maintain 100% PBO funded based on approximate assumptions for participant count, liability cash flow profile, liability yield, service cost, PBGC premia and contributions. Numbers may not add due to rounding. Based on BlackRock’s Q3 2021 Capital Market Assumptions. Expected risk and expected returns are calculated using Aladdin Risk Model and are based on BlackRock’s capital market assumptions. Expected risk and return estimates are subject to uncertainty and error. Expected risk and returns for each asset class can be conditional on economic scenarios; in the event a particular scenario comes to pass, actual risk and returns could be significantly higher or lower than forecasted. A material growth allocation is still required for most plans at 100% PBO funded Source: BlackRock, for illustrative purposes only. Also see https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-us/insights/investment-actions/de-risking-glidepaths. Another potential argument to keep some growth assets in the portfolio for fully funded plans is the diminishing marginal benefit one gets from a surplus risk perspective when LDI assets get beyond around 75% of total plan assets, relative to the benefits realized at earlier points on the glidepath. Specifically, when moving from 75% in LDI to 90% in LDI (and 25% in growth assets to 10% in growth assets) we find that expected surplus risk for a frozen plan only declines 0.7% from 3.4% to 2.7%, whereas the expected return of the portfolio declines by 0.8%, from 3.7% to 2.9%. In other words, the expected surplus risk benefit is arguably small, relative to the give up in return, at the final glidepath step. At earlier steps on the glidepath, implementing an LDI program tends to result in materially higher surplus risk reduction per unit of return. From the sponsor’s perspective, a case can potentially be made to continue holding growth assets in an overfunded plan to generate pension income and thus improve non-operating earnings, or to generate a surplus for other uses (e.g. fund retiree medical expenses1, facilitate mergers and acquisitions2). However, we would caution investment decision makers that the ERISA fiduciary responsibility to focus on preserving benefits remains the ultimate priority when designing investment strategies for DB plans and that eventually the plan will become well-funded enough that a 90% or higher LDI allocation is warranted. We also encourage sponsors to consider the impact of “trapped surplus” in the plan, in particular the stringent rules and potential tax penalties3 if the sponsor seeks to revert surplus plan assets back to itself. Portfolio construction: Asset classes for a de-risked portfolio As pension plans de-risk, it is likely that an increasing proportion of the total $3.7 trillion in DB assets will be invested in investment grade corporate bonds to match the interest rate and spread risk in liabilities. Indeed, we calculate that U.S. DB plans already own approximately 19% all investment grade U.S. Corporate bonds in existence 5. Bond supply over the past 10 years has largely met demand with the investment grade U.S. corporate bond market growing from $2.8 trillion in 2011 to $6.2 trillion in 2021 according to Bloomberg data, but to the extent rising interest rates and higher leverage ratios start to reduce the speed of corporate bond issuance at the same time LDI allocations for DB plans are growing, issuer and sector concentration in this asset class may become a greater concern. Going forward it may be necessary to look for other asset classes that can keep up with liability growth with marginal impacts on surplus risk. We continue to believe that not all diversifying assets are created equal when considered in liability-relative terms. For example, in last years’ pension themes we highlighted that commodities are commonly considered a sound diversifying asset class in asset-only terms, but are one of the least effective in preserving funded ratios in the worst environments for DB plans – specifically when equities decline at the same time as rates decline. Unfortunately, Q1 2020 was a case-in-point where broad commodity exposures, as measured by the S&P GSCI index, dropped -42% compared to a decline in Russell 1000 Large Cap equities of -21% at the same time rates declined. In other words, commodities did not provide the diversifying protection to funded ratios when it was needed most. The need for downside protection to funded ratios becomes even more acute for well-funded plans. Instead, we prefer diversifying assets – either in the LDI portfolio or the growth portfolio – that have interest rate sensitive characteristics similar to pension liabilities. Some may still suffer low or negative returns if equities sell off and rates decline, but not as sharply from a funded ratio perspective due to a positive exposure to the rates factor. Examples include real estate, multi-sector fixed income, securitized debt, high yield, emerging market debt, and infrastructure. Private credit may also be attractive for less well funded plans that do not have immediate intention to engage in a PRT transaction or to terminate. As shown in the left panel below, investment grade corporate bond spreads are near historic lows. This may increase the urgency for plans to tilt away from these assets in 2022, and towards a broader fixed income universe such as the one shown in the right panel below for at least part of their portfolio.

Download full report Implementation: Daily monitoring, technology, and toolkit expansion As investment strategies for well-funded plans evolve from a total return “set-and-forget” approach to a dynamic LDI approach, monitoring funded ratios and key risk exposures such as interest rate hedge ratios using real-time data and flexible technology becomes increasingly critical for success. As benefits are paid, the duration of a typical closed or frozen plan declines requiring evolving LDI exposures. As shown in the left panel below, we believe capital efficient instruments still have an important role in these programs enabling plans to target specific interest rate and credit spread hedge ratios. To the extent some plans seek to evolve their credit exposures dynamically, the right panel below demonstrates that adding ETFs to the LDI toolkit can improve liquidity and materially lower transaction costs. For example, when comparing the transaction costs in March 2020 of two commonly used fixed income ETFs to the transaction costs of an equivalent basket of physical bonds, the bid/ask spread of LQD to physical investment grade credit was 3bps vs 57bps and the bid/ask spread of HYG to physical high yield bonds was 2bps vs 147bps. In other words, investors that did not use fixed income ETFs to implement tilts in March 2020 may have eliminated a material amount of the gain they anticipated when bond spreads were high because they paid such high transaction costs to increase or adjust their exposure. Capital efficient instruments allow plans to target specific hedge ratios, adding fixed income ETFs to the implementation toolkit can lower transaction costs Source (bottom): Bloomberg. BlackRock.

Download full report End-game solutions: Forward planning is critical With the average PBO funded ratio for corporate plans above 99%, we anticipate many sponsors will weigh the decision of keeping the plan on the balance sheet in a very low risk liability-matched portfolio, or seek to reduce or eliminate the plan from the balance sheet through PRT. Data from LIMRA indicates that around $35bn of pension liabilities were transferred in 2021 making it a record year for U.S. PRT activity, but this was less than 1% of total DB liabilities meaning we believe it is still early days in the trend towards PRT. The most common approach to PRT is a partial risk transfer of retiree liabilities, and pricing for these transactions is becoming increasingly more competitive with some deals priced below par (i.e. less than 100% premium vs PBO liability). However, our experience is these transactions can take a year or two to successfully implement. From an investment perspective, there is important planning work required to get the fixed income portfolio “insurance ready and as shown below, we estimate plans can save up to 98bps by transitioning assets-in-kind (rather than selling bonds and transitioning cash) to the insurance company. If there are remaining pension liabilities on the balance sheet post PRT, it is likely these will have a materially different risk profile requiring a new asset allocation policy. We believe that forward planning is critical for success in any end-game solution.

The narrative is complimented by comments from your peers and thought-pieces by BlackRock experts. Setting the scene 54% of respondents identify geo-political risk as the most serious macro risk to their investment strategy over the next two years. However, environmental risk is the fastest increasing trend, with 36% of respondents choosing it as one of their most serious macro risks this year – more than twice as many as in 2015. Nearly half of the respondents see three current trends intensifying: the overhaul of insurance distribution models; the increased focus on sustainability; and the application of digital technology. Around a third of insurers expect M&A activity to accelerate in the industry. Download full report Diversification into non-core assets in search of income 60% of insurers expect to increase their appetite for investment risk over the next two years – the highest level since we started tracking this information in 2015. Insurers are looking to reallocate out of core fixed income and into private assets, including higher-yielding fixed income, while compensating for the loss of liquidity through additional cash allocations. As insurers increase their risk appetite, credit quality and increased liquidity needs remain key priorities. Insurers are increasingly looking to ETFs as effective tools for managing liquidity and enhancing yield. Download full report Growing focus on sustainability 95% of respondents believe climate risk will have a significant or very significant impact on portfolio construction and strategic asset allocation over the next two years. Insurers embed sustainability ever more deeply into their investment selection processes and expect to increase their allocation to sustainable investments by about 30% over the next two years. Accelerating advances in technology Nearly 60% of insurers plan to increase their investment in technology over the coming years. Insurance companies are quickly moving toward integrated, end-to-end investment platforms covering the whole spectrum of asset classes, from public to private, to enable integrated asset-liability management and multi-asset risk management. In this year’s survey, insurers said they will use increases in technology spending to assist the move into alternatives and to integrate climate risk into portfolio management. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Zach Buchwald, head of USCA Institutional Business, and Anne Ackerley, head of the Retirement Group, give their insight on the future of America’s retirement in this featured piece, originally published in Newsweek.',\n",
       "  'content': ' This piece was originally published in Newsweek on 10/18/21. Americans used to have so much excitement about retirement. After decades of hard work, we imagined our golden years would be filled with travel and relaxation, or maybe even a home in a warmer climate. All of this would be supported by our savings, a pension and a little help from Social Security. There were so many possibilities ahead. These are now stories of a bygone era. The notion of \"how I will enjoy my retirement\" has instead become \"how will I support myself through retirement?\" Most Americans retire today without enough savings to maintain their quality of life, and one in four Americans has nothing saved for retirement at all. They rely instead on Social Security, a program that was never intended to be the sole source of income. America has been barreling toward a retirement crisis for decades. When pension plans were the norm, we retired from work, but not from the paycheck—the pension provided an income stream for life. But corporate America closed their pensions as the costs became harder to predict, and in some cases, threatened the survival of the business. For many Americans, the 401(k) model doesn\\'t really work as a replacement for a pension—we simply don\\'t amass enough savings by the time we\\'re ready to retire. And even a substantial \"nest egg\" is just not the same as a paycheck for the rest of your life. With a 401(k) plan, the burden is on retirees to figure out how to make their money last, and many end up hoarding their nest eggs because they worry about outliving their savings, or about having a health scare. As a result, even those retirees who save enough tend to have a lower quality of life in retirement. It does not have to be this way. Improvements to 401(k) plans can increase savings rates and provide lifetime income without expecting companies to take on large pension-like obligations. If you work in corporate America today, it\\'s hit or miss whether you have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Unlike health insurance, companies are not obligated to provide access to retirement plans. And whether or not employees participate in their retirement plans is also hit or miss. Those of us that work for companies that automatically enroll employees into their 401(k) plans are 20 times more likely to save for retirement than people working for companies without a plan. In fact, if uniform access and auto-enrollment became the norm, it could triple participation rates and double retirement savings across America. We also need to help retirees access a lifetime income stream to improve their quality of life during retirement. Annuities are one of the best solutions to create a steady stream of income, but they are absent from most retirement plans. It\\'s up to workers to decide whether to use their 401(k) for an annuity, and most don\\'t. Having said that, it would help if the typical annuity was simpler and less expensive. Congress is working to fix some of these shortcomings. A bi-partisan bill passed in 2019 that made it easier for Americans to save for retirement. And there is more legislation in motion that will make retirement plans with auto-enrollment and auto-escalation more available, and make it easier for plans to include annuities. These changes would improve the default model. But relying on the government alone won\\'t fix the retirement crisis. Corporate America and the investment community need to work together to create better retirement plans for American workers. We can use the existing 401(k) architecture, but with glide paths to help provide both an adequate nest egg at retirement, as well as access to a simple, inexpensive annuity to create a lifetime income stream. The retirement plan of the future will still look like a 401(k), but it should feel more like a pension. American workers have proven, time and again, that they are the backbone of this country. Throughout the pandemic they kept hospitals, businesses and our communities running. As companies now look to improve their offerings to their workforce, retirement should be a central focus. Retirement security has long been touted as attracting teachers, police and firefighters to their professions. Why can\\'t businesses follow suit? In an era when attracting and retaining talent is so important, but also so challenging, the companies with the best retirement benefits might also become the ones with the best talent. The beauty of this arrangement is that it actually benefits companies as much as the retirees. Read this piece on Newsweek. Download commentary '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In our latest corporate pensions peer study, BlackRock examines dispersions and how plans can align their investment strategy with their end-state objectives.',\n",
       "  'content': \" Overview U.S. corporate defined benefit (DB) plans’ funding ratios have been nudging higher since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) and many are now within the reach of full funding. However, dispersions across industries continue to persist and some plans are taking on either too much risk or not enough to meet their targets. BlackRock's Client Insight Unit analyzed data of the 200 largest DB plans to understand what’s creating dispersions and how plans can align their investment strategy with their end-state objectives. The 2006 Pension Protection Act (PPA) aimed to strengthen workers’ pension benefit protections and improve funding levels, but in the wake of GFC the funding ratios plummeted. Now for the first time since 2007, DB plans’ average funding status is estimated to be over 95%. To stay on track, we believe pension investors need to focus on preserving funded status improvements, while mitigating risks, and positioning for the future. The next market event is always around the corner and the recovery might not be as swift as what we saw in 2020. Funded ratios since the GFC Source: Data Source S&P Capital IQ as of December 31, 2020. Universe of data consists of top 200 DB plans from S&P1500 sponsored companies. Assets include single- and multi-employer plans. For illustrative purposes only. Dips and dispersions While most plans weathered the market volatility of 2020 and retained higher funding ratios, we saw meaningful dispersions existed across sectors. We found evidence that the materiality of a pension to a company’s financials could influence the amount of risk plans may take, contributing to funding dispersions. At the beginning of the pandemic, global equity markets fell precipitously, rates across the U.S. Treasury yield curve fell below 1%, and credit spreads widened, resulting in the steepest drawdowns since the GFC. However, with unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus, many plans recovered, and have even seen significant improvements in funded status. The BlackRock Investment Institute estimates the cumulative activity shortfall in the U.S. and Europe following the pandemic will end up being a fraction – roughly a quarter – of what we saw during the GFC. The discretionary fiscal response now is a multiple of the response following 2008 – roughly four times. A policy reaction that may not repeat itself in the face of another crisis. Funding ratios dive from pandemic led market volatility Source: BlackRock LDI Market Watch. Estimated U.S. corporate pension funded ratios 12/31/2018 – 7/30/2021. While the average funding ratios of pensions is over 95% as of July 30, 2021, our analysis showed there is a lot of dispersion. Our observations comparing peer plans found funding levels differed between sectors, as well as gaps in alignment between investment strategy with the end-state risk profile. Evaluating the enterprise We analyzed the funded status and plan materiality of the client as well as their industry peers. Based on year end 2020 data, funded status of pensions in the financial and consumer the discretionary sector was over 100% funded on average, while plans in the information technology, energy and real estate sectors are around 80% funded on average. One potential cause of this dispersion is the different level of pension benefits across sectors. The more well-funded sectors of the peer study, such as financial services, were also where nearly all pensions were closed to new participants. Whereas, the less well-funded plans tended to be ones in sectors with growing liabilities (often open plans that are still accruing benefits) and where the sponsor has been less willing or able to contribute over the last several years. Pension dispersion across sectors as of Dec 31, 2020 Source: Data Source S&P Capital IQ as of December 31, 2020. Universe of data consists of top 200 DB plans from S&P1500 sponsored companies. Assets include single- and multi-employer plans. For illustrative purposes only. While funded status is a good barometer of overall pension plan health, other underlying plan metrics also have a meaningful influence on DB plans. Our peer study compared DB plan’s risk profile in the context of the plan sponsor’s corporate enterprise and identified additional factors that could affect the asset allocation decisions and ability for the plan to achieve higher funding. For example, our analysis showed a relationship between the materiality of the pension to the company’s balance sheet (i.e., how much market capitalization was represented by pension obligations) and the amount of risk a plan deployed. On average pension obligations represent roughly 40% of a plan sponsor’s market cap, with the median closer to 16%. When pension plans comprised a smaller portion of the balance sheet, sponsors appear to have more flexibility to both contribute and to take investment risk, pushing average funding ratios higher. Plans that represent more of the company’s balance sheet may have lower tolerance for risk and in turn could be more focused on downside risk and liability driven investing (LDI) strategies to avoid making any unplanned contributions. We have seen plans in some industries (e.g., autos and communications) undertake partial risk transfers to reduce the size of the plan on the balance sheet, potentially giving them more future flexibility to take investment risk to close funding gaps. Funded status and plan materiality Source: S&P Capital IQ, corporate annual reporting and BlackRock as of December 31, 2020. For Illustrative purposes only. Assets and PBO (projected benefit obligation) include qualified and non-qualified U.S. plans. Ranks are in ascending order and compared against the top 200 defined benefit plans in AUM from the S&P1500 sponsored companies. Peers are selected based on client input. We also saw a wide range of impacts that a company’s income statements could have on their pension’s investment strategy. We found that some industries with stronger cash flows, such as regulated utilities, tend to take more risk in the investment portfolios, since they may have more control over their prices and costs that allow them to make higher contribute during in market drawdown scenarios. Another possible rationale is some plans may hold more risk in their portoflio because of the impact pension expense has on the income statement. Honing in on the hurdle To understand how plans can efficiently earn the returns needed to meet its objectives, we compared the Hurdle Rate of Return to the Expected Return on Assets (EROA) assumption. We determined the Hurdle Rate of Return required to achieve the target funding level at the horizon (assumed to be 110% in 10 years), by considering the funded status, interest cost, service cost, PBGC expenses, benefit payments, estimated contributions, etc. Hurdle Rate of Return required to achieve target funding “Hurdle Rate” is defined as the required rate of return for the plan to reach 110% funded ratio in 10 years. It is estimated using the PBO, asset, interest cost, service cost, planned contributions, projected liability payout and other data from the annual reporting as of 12/31/2020. Source: S&P Capital IQ, corporate annual reporting and BlackRock as of December 31, 2020. Our analysis showed that around 30% of the plans look to be misaligned between their investment strategy and end-state objectives. Approximately 17% of plans may be taking on more risk, while approximately 13% of plans may be taking too little risk than is required to meet their objectives. Expected return on assets vs. hurdle rate of return Source: S&P Capital IQ, corporate annual reporting and BlackRock as of December 31, 2020. Once again, we saw significant dispersion across sectors. For example, utility and industrial plans have higher EROA assumptions than information technology and real estate plans. Combined with the Hurdle Rates of Return, there are some sectors where the plans are expected to earn less than required (e.g., energy, communication services, etc.). This confirms our earlier point that funded ratios in these industries have lagged, while others are expected to earn more than required (e.g., health care, financials, etc.) which has resulted in stronger funded ratios. Driving towards full funding We believe the learnings from our analysis may help plans determine the best path forward to either improve funding levels or maintain in the face of future volatility. There are three primary levers DB plan managers can pull to steer the pension plan to full funding: investment performance, contributions and time horizon. The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) provided some funding relief that alleviated immediate contribution needs. As a result, this may put more focus on investment returns if plan sponsors choose to not contribute beyond the minimum required amounts, especially after future market drawdowns. Therefore, implementing a strategic asset allocation (SAA) with an appropriate level of expected return and risk is paramount for pension plans to successfully meet funding targets. Given the level of dispersion across funding, pensions do not stand to benefit from a one size fits all solution. This will depend on each plan’s specific situation, as well as the portfolio’s goals and constraints. We have outlined some of the key trends we found that can help enhance portfolio positioning going forward. De-risk and diversify With improved funding levels, many pensions are hitting glide path triggers and allocating more to LDI strategies. As traditional LDI strategies take on a greater allocation, it is common to invest more in investment grade bonds to better match liabilities. However, with corporate spreads at historic tights, some plans are looking to diversify the exposure beyond long corporates in strategies such as multi-sector and securitized debt. We saw plans that had more flexibility to allocate across fixed income sectors offset the headwind from downgrades and defaults, which impact assets and liabilities differently. From our research this headwind on traditional LDI strategies may be approximately 40 basis points annually. Additionally, many plans may have the opportunity to better manage their funded ratio risk through custom overlay approaches. Whether on a mandate-level, truing up shorter duration mandates toward liability duration or at a plan level through completion strategies, these strategies can allow for both reduction of oversized or unintended risks, as well as the flexibility to meet return objectives. Efficient growth of funded status Plans that were underfunded may need to look beyond traditional strategies to improve funding levels. Custom overlay approaches not only help close duration gaps but can be very capital efficient and allow a larger allocation to the growth portfolio (i.e., hedging more interest rate risk with less dollars in fixed income). Additionally, many are rethinking income-oriented strategies within the growth portfolio. In a lower-for-longer environment and dynamic markets, traditional fixed income strategies may not offer the same level of income nor diversification expected in the past. Increasing flexibility into unconstrained fixed income and incorporating the ability to spread exposures across the liquidity spectrum, into areas like private credit, may help investors to meet higher return expectations, diversify existing risks in the growth portfolio and align the portfolio with liability risks. Lastly, plans with longer time horizons such as open plans, may have greater ability to take on more private assets and earn illiquidity premia. We modeled the impact of reallocating from public equity to private markets (e.g., private credit, real estate, infrastructure and private equity) and found expected returns increased. Risk increased commensurately, but the returns per unit of risk improved on average. None of these strategies offer the perfect solution. But we are optimistic on the opportunities of the post-pandemic recovery and possibilities of previously overlooked portions of the market. Pension plans will need to consider each carefully in the context of their current allocations, return targets, assets, liabilities, stakeholders, and other characteristics. As we mentioned in our 2021 corporate pension themes, acting on any of these ideas, however, may require an ability to be nimble and respond when opportunity knocks. Plans should position themselves to move quickly to capitalize on potential opportunities. \"},\n",

       "  'content': ' Aperio’s research and analysis Tax loss harvesting is broadly recognized as a means to generate positive alpha over an index in the form of tax savings. However, most of the extensive research on the value of loss harvesting in separately managed accounts assumes that portfolios are funded with cash. It is also not uncommon for loss-harvesting providers to produce composite reports that include only accounts that start with cash. In practice, about half of Aperio’s clients with taxable accounts fund those accounts with securities. For these “legacy” portfolios, Aperio’s active tax management provides two main tax benefits. First, at inception, they transition the client’s holdings to an Aperio strategy using tax-aware optimization, aiming to lower tracking error to a benchmark while minimizing gains. Second, after the portfolio’s inception and throughout its life cycle, they continue to harvest losses to generate tax alpha.1 Tax alpha in legacy accounts is typically lower than in those that start with cash, as a highly appreciated initial holding may never convert to a loss. In this note, Aperio analyzes these two benefits by looking at the distribution of tax savings on transitions and the tax alpha attained from loss harvesting. Tax savings on transitions In most cases, transitioning legacy positions to an Aperio strategy provides an up-front benefit in the form of deferred taxes.1 By building a more diversified portfolio around existing positions, we help avoid a full liquidation of the portfolio—and the significant capital gains that can result (see Figure 1). In fact, almost all of our taxable legacy portfolios enjoyed the benefit of migrating without the need for a full liquidation. The average saving was 8.1%, with the central half of observations ranging from 4.0% to 11.0%. Distribution of tax savings on transitions Source: Aperio - Tax savings from deferred taxes generated by transitioning portfolios, in an estate/donation disposition, at inception. Data is from 4/12/2011 through 12/31/2020. See Aperio’s research paper for details. Tax alpha from loss harvesting The ratio of cost basis to market value (CB/MV) at inception is a good predictor of a portfolio’s potential to generate tax alpha (see Figure 2). As anticipated, tax alpha rose along with the initial CB/MV. We saw a five-fold increase in tax alpha in portfolios with higher basis than market value relative to the lowest CB/MV group (20%–40%). Tax alpha in portfolios that started with cash was on par with their initial CB/MV (100%). 5-year average annualized tax alpha Source: Aperio - Average annualized tax alpha at the first five-year horizon for standard loss-harvesting portfolios in an estate/donation disposition funded with legacy positions, grouped by initial cost to market value (measured at the end of each account’s inception month), and with cash. The earliest inception date is in June 2006, and the end date of our dataset is 3/31/2021.See Aperio’s research paper for details. Conclusion A large portion of the capital gains taxes embedded in a legacy portfolio can generally be deferred by transitioning to an Aperio strategy in a tax-efficient manner. Subsequent loss harvesting provides additional tax alpha, which tends to be higher for portfolios with fewer embedded gains at inception. With tax-aware optimization, a portfolio goes through a powerful transformation. Losers are sold, yielding a potential tax benefit to the investor in the presence of outside gains, and replenished with new securities while maintaining close index tracking. Through the deferred realization of capital gains and disciplined loss harvesting, clients may enjoy the tax benefits of their investments. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Adjusting portfolios in seeking to meet return assumptions in an ever-changing world We analyzed fund-level data for over 85 public pensions to understand the aftermath of the pandemic’s market volatility and how plans are positioned to meet return assumptions over the next decade. After a year of navigating uncharted terrain, public pensions entered 2021 looking ahead to a post-pandemic recovery, but the far-reaching implications of COVID-19 on governments has added additional pressures for plans to generate adequate investment performance. State and local governments incurred large costs to manage the pandemic and keep communities safe, while some simultaneously experienced decreases in tax revenue.1 Although tax revenue shortfalls were not as extreme as many initially predicted, budgets could still be squeezed to a point that will impact future pension contributions. Meanwhile, there’s evidence that the pandemic caused sharp rises in retirements, potentially adding to the widening gap between benefit payments and contributions.2 The long-term impact of these trends continues to unfold against a backdrop of challenging funding conditions. Since the Great Financial Crisis, funded status has hovered around the low to mid 70s. Strong performance in public equities has helped, but funded ratios continue to struggle due to other factors, such as sluggish payroll growth and improved mortality of retirees. We believe looking forward many public pension plans have to hit their return assumptions consistently, and may even need to increase performance targets, to meet growing liabilities. Most plans will need to rethink their asset allocations to make up ground. Our analysis estimates that over half the plans may fall short of current assumed returns, based on current asset exposures and BlackRock’s May 2021 Capital Market Assumptions (CMAs). This year we considered these challenges as we completed our annual public peer study to provide a holistic overview of the public pension investment landscape, including asset allocation, expected returns, risk factor decomposition, and stress testing. BlackRock partnered with Pensions & Investments to collect fund-level asset data for more than 85 U.S. public pensions. Using Aladdin® analytics, we mapped each fund to our asset class CMAs to estimate its risk and return characteristics. (Please see Exhibit A) The plans we reviewed represent close to $1.8tn in pensions assets under management. Plans ranged in size from $300mn to $246bn, with average and median assets under management of $20bn and $9.5bn, respectively. The plans have an average funded status of 75.6%. Running in place Over the past decade, public pensions surpassed their assumed return expectations, largely due to the strength in public equity markets. However, our research suggests higher than expected investment performance was not enough to recover from the market stresses of the early aughts and public plans are still experiencing sideways to downward movement in funded ratios. Following the Global Financial Crisis, public pensions realized average annualized returns of more than 8% over the past 10 years, while the median assumed return targets are now around 7%, after steadily declining over the years. Despite this strong investment performance, actuarial funded status has continued to drop over the past two decades from fully funded in 2001 to about 85% just prior to 2008, then to the low to mid 70s in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis and generally remains in that range today. Since the turn of the century; market stresses, such as the 2001 Tech Bubble and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, caused significant asset erosion and declines in funded ratios, which require larger returns to make up. For example, to recover from a 25% market decline, a portfolio would need to earn over 33%. Our analysis found that despite outperforming assumed returns following these crises, the market declines had lasting impact on the cumulative performance of a theoretical portfolio that consistently met its assumed return expectation and the average realized return of public pensions over the same period. 10 years of strong returns Source: Public Plan Data, January 2021. Past performance is not indicative of future results. During longer recoveries the liability would also continue to grow due to factors such as normal and interest costs, making it even more difficult to get back to full funding. Additionally, while benefit payments reduce both the asset and the liability by the same amount, the denominator effect of being underfunded results in a decline in funded status. The combination of these factors has increased the pressures on the investment performance to make up shortfalls for underfunded plans. We believe building efficient portfolios to diversify risk and improve returns will prove critical for public plans in the post pandemic recovery. We see opportunities across the following themes to help portfolios reach return expectations, while helping to weather market downturns of the future. Portfolio resilience demands climate resistance The historical market declines of the 2000s, including last year’s pandemic drop, demonstrated the need for pensions to enhance their portfolio resilience and downside protection. We believe climate risk and the net zero transition represent some of the biggest future market events and a thorough environmental, social and governance (ESG) analysis can help build more defensive and robust portfolios. Avoiding climate-related damages will help prevent economic deterioration and improve risk-asset returns. Reallocating to sustainable exposures preserves the expected return for the average pension portfolio, with slight reduction in risk based on our forward-looking CMAs, which now incorporate the impacts of climate change, reflecting our view that climate risk is investment risk. Incorporating ESG into portfolio construction also positions portfolios for the post-carbon transition. Our analysis found that swapping the average plan’s US equity exposure from the MSCI USA Index to the MSCI USA ESG Enhanced Index not only significantly improved ESG ratings and scores, but also reduced the portfolio’s carbon intensity by more than 30%. For every $1 million invested, that reduction is equivalent to eliminating the emissions of 10 passenger vehicles driven in a full year. Investors that account for carbon and climate risk exposures in portfolio design can help mitigate risk likely caused by possible assets re-pricing, increased regulation, and costs, and changing consumer preferences. The impact of incorporating ESG Source: BlackRock, with data provided by MSCI ESG Research for individual companies as of May 2021. The Weighted Average Carbon Intensity measures a portfolio’s exposure to carbon intensive companies. The figure is the sum of security weight (normalized for corporate positions only) multiplied by the security Carbon Intensity. MSCI rates companies on a ‘AAA’ to ‘CCC’ scale according to their exposure to industry specific ESG risks and their ability to manage those risks relative to peers. The portfolio MSCI ESG Rating is based on the weighted average ESG Quality Scores of the underlying companies within the portfolio, and then adjusted based on portfolio exposure to issuers with positive trending ESG scores, issuers with negative trending ESG scores, and ESG Laggards (B and CCC rated issuers). The result is the ESG Quality Score, which can be mapped directly to the letter ESG Rating. The MSCI ESG Pillar Scores are the weighted average of the underlying companies\\' scores rated on a scale of 0-10. Pillar scores are comparable across all industries because they are not industry-weighted like the overall MSCI ESG Quality Score. ‘Coverage’ is defined as the percent of the portfolio’s underlying holdings that have an MSCI ESG Rating.

All figures based on US EPA\\'s calculation for converting greenhouse gas emissions (tCO2e) numbers into different types of equivalent units. Hypothetical example is for illustrative purposes only. Results for actual accounts will vary. Moreover, the transition to a low-carbon world offers tremendous opportunities3 for economies and risk assets. Our CMAs reflect our view that the green transition to a low-carbon economy, consistent with the Paris Agreement goals, will deliver an improved outlook for growth and risk assets relative to doing nothing. Globally, we estimate a cumulative loss in economic output of nearly 25% over the next two decades if no climate change mitigation measures were taken. To give another illustration, our expected returns for U.S. equities are 2% higher under a green transition in which the economy embraces the post-carbon future. Diversification potential of China A-Shares Shifting assets within public market exposures could also help public pensions increase portfolio efficiency. One area of interest is onshore China exposure, as our research4 shows the potential to boost returns while providing diversification that have some risk benefits. China has grown to represent almost 20% of global GDP, but it’s still not fully reflected in global benchmarks. For example, the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) holds a weight of just 4% in China equities. (As of April 2021) China A-Shares, which trade on the mainland exchanges of Shanghai and Shenzhen, have especially compelling potential to enhance both absolute and risk-adjusted returns. A-Shares have become much more accessible to investors outside of China in recent years. The MSCI China A Index offers relatively high potential returns and low historical correlations to other equity assets, including a correlation of just 0.36 to the MSCI USA Index. In our analysis we decreased MSCI ACWI exposure by 5% and reallocated to MSCI China A Index, which resulted in an average increase in expected return of 23 bps, while decreasing risk by 14 bps. Outcome for specific portfolios will vary depending on the client’s constraints and risk appetite. Expected return and risk Source: BlackRock as of May 2021. Expected 10-year risk and return calculations based on BlackRock’s capital market assumptions (CMA), See section titled \"Capital Market and Modeling Assumptions\" in Exhibit C at the end of this analysis for additional details. Risk: 84% confidence interval, 246 constant weighted monthly observations; 1yr horizon. For illustrative purposes only. There are no assurances that the hypothetical portfolio\\'s objectives will be met. Additionally, there are frequently sharp differences between a hypothetical performance record and the actual record subsequently achieved. Another inherent limitation of these results is that the allocation decisions reflected in the performance record were not made under actual market conditions and, therefore, cannot completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual portfolio management. The performance shown does not represent any existing portfolio, and as such, is not an investible product. There is no guarantee that the capital market assumptions will be achieved, and actual returns could be significantly higher or lower than those shown. Fixing fixed income The 2020s have ushered in a new era for persistent low yields across most fixed income markets. Many of our public pension partners are weighing the impact the low yield environment could have on their ability to meet return targets and the diversification advantages of fixed income allocations. We see opportunities for them to reevaluate both the role of fixed income in their portfolio and how they allocate within their income bucket. On the fiscal side, the US government’s response dwarfed the steps it took during and after the Great Financial Crisis. Our analysis5 estimated that the pandemic had a quarter of the GFC’s overall economic impact but received four times the fiscal response. All that spending has important implications for inflation, economic growth, government debt that drive bond performance. Meanwhile, changes in monetary policy pulled down interest rates and bond yields. The rate on the 10-year Treasury note, only about 2% at the beginning of the pandemic, fell rapidly and sharply, dropping almost 1.5 percentage points in just three months. Although yields creeped higher during the first quarter of 2021, we expect a low-yield environment to persist for some time and to pose several challenges to public pensions. Low yields could diminish bonds’ ability to provide the degree of diversification from equities that they have in the past. Yields have little room left to fall Source: BlackRock, Bloomberg, as of May 2021. U.S. recession periods are defined by National Bureau of Economic Research. Graph displays U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rate changes during recession periods. 10-year Treasury change reflects the biggest move seen from as early as six months before the recession period. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The chances of fixed income contributing much to total returns has, in our view, been greatly diminished. Our estimates project the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Index to return up to 1.8% in our May 2021 CMAs, reflecting a first-quarter rise in interest rates. The average US public pension plan has a 23% allocation to fixed income, with approximately half those assets in domestic core. Such meaningful exposure to an asset with a likely return of less than 2% makes it very difficult for plans to achieve their desired results. It also places considerable pressure on the growth portion of the portfolio to outperform. For example, consider a hypothetical plan with a 7% assumed return. If the plan were to maintain a 20% allocation to an asset, such as core fixed income, with an expected return below 2%, then that portfolio exposure would generate only about one-twentieth of the target return. The remaining allocations would need to generate at least 8.25% to reach the performance targets. To reach this higher growth target the portfolio may need to take on greater risk in the growth portfolio. Introducing judicious exposure to less-liquid assets within the fixed-income allocation could prove crucial to meeting performance targets and maximizing the return generated per unit of risk. Private debt underwriting enables investors to offer lending on their own terms, potentially leading to stronger covenants and better downside mitigation than what is currently available in the public markets. These qualities can improve recoveries and loss ratios in the event of defaults, potentially producing better risk-adjusted yields. Fixed income can also help provide critical liquidity for pensions to meet their liabilities and we’ve seen some clients utilize ETFs to balance exposure to less liquid asset classes. Investors with the willingness and capacity to accept greater risk in their fixed income allocations can also benefit from considering opportunistic private credit investments. Opportunistic credit involves lending to issuers that need flexible, bespoke financing solutions. It offers elements of both income and capital appreciation, with the potential for upside participation that can help deliver equity-like returns with a debt-like risk profile. While public pensions have been steadily increasing their allocations to private credit, our data shows that they tend to under-allocate to opportunistic credit. Opportunistic private credit looks underfunded Source: BlackRock and P&I. Average Private Credit allocations of all plans is a simple average. Gaining ground with illiquid assets Illiquid assets may help pensions meet these aggressive demands. Public pensions currently have a 23% average allocation to illiquid assets, and our research indicates that many plans could assume greater illiquidity risk in pursuit of return premiums. Specifically, plans could use private markets as a primary tool to help them meet assumed returns and diversify against risk factor concentration. Our current market assumptions expect 10-year annualized returns of 9.3% for private credit and 19.5% for private equity. We modeled the potential impact of reallocating 5% of each plan’s exposure from public equity to private equity and found expected returns increased by more than 70 basis points, on average, bringing many plans within reach of their assumed return. Risk increased commensurately, but portfolio efficiency—return per unit of risk—increased by an average of 0.03. Many public pension plans are on this track as allocations to private equity and real assets have increased since 2010 by 2% and more than 4%, respectively. Our research suggests that public pensions have the ability to continue this trend and would benefit from doing so. Looking ahead None of these strategies—increasing allocations to illiquid assets, shifting portfolios’ geographic weights, incorporate climate considerations, evolving fixed income allocations — are the silver bullet. But we are optimistic on the opportunities of the post-pandemic recovery and possibilities of previously overlooked portions of the market. Public pension plans will need to consider each carefully in the context of their current allocations, return targets, assets, liabilities, stakeholders, and other characteristics. BlackRock has the tools and expertise to help our public pension partners perform this type of analysis for to help them reach their goals in an efficient manner. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this blog, we will discuss how the upcoming changes to US tax policy and tax advantage solutions will impact family offices.',\n",
       "  'content': ' President Biden took office at a pivotal moment with the U.S. facing historical debt levels and widening inequality. Tax policy is at the top of the agenda, as the new administration seeks to fund the pandemic recovery with progressive reforms. Earners making more than US$1 million a year, could see the top marginal rate on long-term capital gains reach 43.4%. Whatever the outcome of these proposed changes, the impact on family offices will be significant and these investors would do well to consider strategies that limit the negative impact of taxes on their wealth. BlackRock invited Nancy Donahue, Chief Investment Strategist of Summit Rock Advisors, to interview Patrick Geddes, Chief Tax Economist and Co-Founder of Aperio along with Lincoln Fleming, Tax Economist, Aperio on the new proposals and what they mean for investors. Following is a summary of their conversation. What are the differences between Biden’s proposed policies from previous reforms? Any time there are changes in the tax code, tax professionals need to recalculate all the economics. Previously we always looked at rate changes, but Biden’s proposal is truly a tax regime change. That’s driving a sea change for the financial industry, bringing taxes to top and center of taxable investor’s minds. One implication is that investors who are worried about tax implications may turn more to ETFs, which tend to be more efficient than the average actively managed fund, as well as municipal bond funds. The industry’s challenge is to bake tax considerations into portfolio construction from the beginning. We often see advisors treating it as an afterthought, and in this new landscape it will need to be prioritized. Should investors realize some capital gains with President Biden’s proposals? President Biden’s proposals include nearly doubles long-term capital gains rate for investors with annual income over $1 million so should investors realize capital gains? The short answer is no, with the exception of clients who meet three different requirements: They intend to realize gains at some point anyway—for example, by selling a business or liquidating a concentrated position. Their income exceeds one million dollars. They have an investment horizon of five years or shorter. The odds of tax regime change increase significantly when you project farther into the future. Most clients won’t check all three of these boxes. But those who do may realize some very significant benefits from accelerating gains. The first potential benefit is to realize long-term capital gains at a rate of 23.8% instead of a potential rate of 43.4%. The second, much less obvious benefit is what we call tax-rate arbitrage. If investors realize gains today and pay the 23.8% rate, they’ll reset their portfolio basis. Resetting the basis helps facilitate future opportunities for tax-loss harvesting: If investments decline from the new basis, the losses could offset future gains at the much higher 43.4% rate. Each of these benefits can be powerful on its own, and they can be extremely compelling combined. That said, it’s important to understand the risks of accelerating the realization of gains. There’s the possibility that tax reform either is not passed or that it’s passed and made retroactive. And a shift in in Washington in four years could undo or reverse any reforms passed this year. Changing a client’s strategy based on political predictions can be very risky, which is one reason doing nothing can be your very best course of action. On the flip side, clients sometimes ask whether they should pause tax-loss harvesting. The thought is that higher future tax rates would increase the value of losses, so they might want to wait to realize those losses. Again, the short answer to their question is no, apart from clients who meet three requirements: They plan eventually to liquidate their portfolio. Their income exceeds one million dollars. They haven’t realized any short-term capital gains, so any harvested losses can offset long-term gains. All the same political risks would apply to people considering pausing tax-loss harvesting. And this strategy involves another risk as well: The losses you plan to use could dissipate by the time you’re ready to take them. How might it affect tax planning to have different rates? The big changes would come for people with income in excess of a million dollars. There would be a seismic shift in the long-term capital gains rate, which could have a huge impact on planning. If the long-term capital gains proposal is passed, the control, customization and flexibility of an SMA will become even more critical. Take a client whose income is above a million dollars in some years and below that level in others. In high-income years, it may make sense for them to harvest losses and to defer recognizing gains; in lower-income years, it may make sense to realize gains systematically. SMAs provide that flexibility. What do the potential tax changes mean for gifting appreciated securities? First of all, surprisingly few taxpayers take advantage of the benefits of donating appreciated assets. We did some research using the IRS data book, focusing on taxpayers who had income in excess of a million dollars. Presumably, these are the taxpayers who have access to the most sophisticated tax advice out there. So, we were surprised by what we saw: 74% of them had donated cash to charity, and 72% had realized net long-term capital gains. But only 8% had donated marketable securities to charity. As advisors, we know the merits of donating appreciated stock to charity and why it’s a very tax-efficient strategy. But this data seems to indicate that our clients do not. I think there are a few reasons. CPAs and tax preparers are in the best position to notice and point out opportunities to gift appreciated securities, but during tax season they tend to be swamped. A lot of investment and wealth advisor are familiar with charitable giving strategies, but some defer to the tax accountants for tax planning. And some clients may know about these strategies but forget, or just find it more convenient to cut a check than to coordinate donation of appreciated securities. Regardless of the reason, I think there’s an incredible opportunity here for advisors to help clients donate to charity in a more tax-efficient manner. As for how potential tax reform could affect planning around charitable giving: The million-dollar level of income would become an incredibly important threshold. Charitable remainder trusts may be used even more in the future to help clients optimize their level of income around this number. What should clients prioritize as they wait for the outcome of these reforms? Flexibility will be crucial, not just over the next 12-24 months, but well into the future. Many clients view the variability in the tax regime and tax rates as a new normal in the way Washington behaves now. Separately managed accounts and tax-efficient strategies will become increasingly compelling for clients as they may need to adjust their strategy with changes of power in the White House. '},\n",

       "  'content': \" Overview Endowments face a unique set of challenges; their high return goals reflect a need to grow intergenerational equity while meeting ambitious spending requirements. At the same time, they have limited resources and face a broad opportunity set. Endowments have long been investment innovators, beginning with the formulation of the original endowment model 25 years ago. While many endowments, particularly those with more resources and access, have outperformed, the median has recently struggled to deliver returns above a 70/30 market benchmark according to the 2020 NACUBO-TIAA Study of Endowments. See chart below. Performance varies by size Annualized performance of a 70/30 benchmark, median endowment, and average large ($1bn+) endowment Source: Data reflects MSCI ACWI, S&P 500, BBG Aggregate, and NACUBO-TIAA Study of Endowments as of Fiscal Year End, June 30, 2020. In the forward-looking market environment, we consider four principles for endowment investing: Focus on factor—not manager—diversification Endowments have diversified across asset classes, particularly into alternatives, which now make up as much as 40-50% of a portfolio. With so much capital tied up in multiple, illiquid managers, it’s hard to know how the overall endowment is positioned. What may seem like appropriate diversification often results in unintended concentration risk. One of the benefits of a factor framework is the understanding of common drivers of return across allocations, regardless of asset class or public/private status. To illustrate this point, the exhibit below shows the capital allocation of NACUBO’s US Endowment peer average portfolio. It encompasses a wide array of asset classes, including hedge funds (23%), private equity (22%), and real assets (11%) like infrastructure, timberland, and real estate. We use Aladdin, BlackRock’s proprietary risk technology, to measure the underlying risk factor exposure of each asset in the portfolio. As the second graph on the bottom demonstrates, the portfolio is far less diversified than it seemed, with nearly 90% of the risk coming from economic growth/equity risk factor. There is a second important conclusion from this analysis: despite holding very different asset composition from the benchmark (in this case a mix of 70/30), the factor composition is very similar. It’s challenging to beat the market if your portfolio has the same exposure. The whole portfolio view through a factor lens Source: Aladdin, 184 months of equally weighted observations as of September 30th, 2020. Control costs Factors are not only a helpful way to rethink asset allocation choices; they help inform manager selection and portfolio construction. Most active managers have consistently underperformed their benchmarks net-of-fees. They also frequently carry systematic biases that are largely responsible for their performance. Aladdin helps us understand sources of a manager’s return, ultimately pointing to cheaper, more reliable factor-based alternatives. In many cases, what may appear to be excess return is merely reliance on commonly rewarded factors, such as excess market exposure, momentum, value, and quality. In the charts below, we show a sample portfolio using a manager-by-manager analysis. It reveals that two-thirds of the active risk can be largely explained by style-factor-level decisions (in yellow). The chart on the bottom right shows the components of that style bias, including a smaller size bias and an emerging market bias, among others. Hidden biases Source: BlackRock, August 2020. The numbers in the chart above are Z-Scores which are statistical measurements of the number of standard deviations the portfolio's style exposure is away from the estimated total equity universe. The stated scores are in excess of the benchmark. Style bias can be pernicious. By employing an approach that relies too heavily on active manager selection and not enough on portfolio construction, many endowments end up with substantial value bias. This hurt performance significantly as growth powered most major equity market indices. We advocate an approach that uses the full toolkit of index, factors, and alpha-seeking sources of return. Index and factor-based investing provide better cost, liquidity, and transparency. For an endowment seeking 7.25% (inflation +5%), however, index investing alone will likely fall short of the target outcome. According to BlackRock’s long-term capital markets expectations, a global 70/30 index portfolio is now expected to return only 5.8%.1 Apply well-resourced convictions Endowments have historically maintained sizeable hedge fund allocations as portfolio diversifiers and sources of idiosyncratic return. Until COVID, we experienced more than 10 years of sustained low market volatility, which challenged many managers and strategies. Today, many endowments are re-evaluating their hedge fund allocations to improve portfolio outcomes. Hedge funds can play a vital role in portfolio performance, but there are several key tenets to success. Manager research is increasingly critical. The difference between a top quartile manager and a median manager in the hedge fund universe is 10-20%. Selecting the right managers within each strategy is essential. See the exhibit below. Manage risk concentration. Accessing managers that consistently produce returns driven by idiosyncratic and secondary risk factors (as compared to primary market risk, or beta) can be challenging. We often help clients re-evaluate portfolio construction with adjustments to manager allocations, strategy weights, and position sizing. Understand negative selection biases resulting from screening criteria. Investors often rely on baseline screens such as minimum AUM or track record rather than more fundamental return drivers. Size, for example, can be an advantage and a disadvantage. It may foster benefits, such as an increased ability to take control positions and drive investment outcomes, but it may also hinder the ability to effectively implement investment theses. Consider different structures to isolate alpha opportunities, such as carve-out portfolios and co-investments. A significant amount of hedge fund excess return is driven by the ability to design unique exposures in partnership with managers that reflect a particular opportunity. Identifying and overweighting these superior opportunities can be the difference between meaningful alpha and disappointing beta. Improve terms: Always focus on fees, capacity, and transparency. Well-resourced teams identify attractive, idiosyncratic risk taking – but pay only for the true value added. Extensive due diligence is needed to identify the real origins of risk and returns. Pick a winner Dispersion of manager performance, annual returns, 2006 - 2019 Source: BlackRock Alternative Advisors (2020) More innovative private market portfolios The rules of the private equity game are changing. As McKinsey recently reported in their study, the NAV of the industry has grown sevenfold since 2002. Amid this rising competition, how can endowments reformulate private market allocations to achieve better outcomes? Many endowment private equity portfolios are very expensive, heavily weighted to larger buyout funds and insufficiently diversified. Endowments and foundations often hold a portfolio of at least 10-20 managers across buyout, growth and venture. This equates to exposure to 150-200 deals. Overdiversification is an expensive way to access what ultimately becomes a portfolio of “private market beta.” Alpha potential has been diversified away. when we look at endowment private markets portfolios, we too often find a combination of over-diversification, high cost and insufficient differentiation in manager and strategy types. The result has been a disappointing decline in returns, as seen in the chart below. Declining outperformance from traditional private equity approaches Cambridge U.S. PE Index: PME Excess Return vs. Russell 3000 Source: Cambridge Associates (2020). Our approach focuses on opportunistic, direct co-investments for 50-75% of the allocation, largely in the buyout and growth equity sectors, plus secondaries, particularly in the post-COVID-19 environment. At first glance, this seems like a large allocation — but as the portfolio reaches scale (i.e., 60–75 deals), overdiversification is less likely. Endowments have exposure to other sources of systematic risk in other areas of their portfolio; they can and should take advantage of private market inefficiencies by increasing their highest-confidence bets. Secondaries have also persistently outperformed primary funds over time and present unique value following a crisis period such as COVID-19. The next chart shows fee savings on a $100mm portfolio by gradually replacing traditional private equity funds with co-investment funds. For a moderate co-investment allocation of 20%, savings of $3.6m in management fees and carried interest over the life of a diversified private equity program are possible. For a program with 50% co-investments, potential savings can be $9.1mm — or more than 900 basis points on a $100mm commitment over the entire lifetime of the fund. Fee savings should never be one’s sole motivation. The power of better execution in private equity Source: BlackRock Private Equity Partners. Gross deal level returns = 2.0x.

Conclusion The endowment model boasts several historic insights that still hold true. As long-term investors, endowments and foundations have exploited their unique ability to harvest illiquidity premiums. Endowments also tap into global investment opportunities and new asset classes through deep loyalty networks, tactically and strategically.Endowments have also been known to pioneer new trading methods and opportunity sets, like co-investment rights. Since relative peer group performance serves as a primary benchmark, perpetual innovation has become a hallmark of endowment investing. As some endowment portfolios have become more complex and diversified by manager, however, excess returns have been compressed to index-like results. These portfolios also bear great expense and lower liquidity. Meanwhile, the universe of liquid alternatives including index strategies has expanded substantially. Blending index and active strategies with true alpha opportunities will result in more optimal performance. ESG should be embraced as a source of resilience and alpha. Operating costs must be controlled much more diligently. And more concentrated investing is in order wherever deep expertise and valid research has led to high conviction. Our approach combines factor-based technology with risk management tools and deep investment experience across the public and private markets. Our focus for the next era of endowment investing seeks to improve cost and capital efficiency, combined with truly unique alpha generation. Theory and practice both show such an approach can deliver consistently superior long-term outcomes. \"},\n",

       "  'content': \" The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout made 2020 an eventful year for investors, to say the least. Steep market declines at the beginning of the year were followed by a swift recovery, spurred by government intervention and strong results from many growth companies. As countries around the world make progress against the pandemic, 2021 promises to deliver a new narrative for family offices. As part of a recent webcast series in partnership with BDO United States, Brian Feurtado, Global Head of Family Offices, spoke with Alan McKenzie, Chief Investment Officer for Family Offices, about investment themes for the coming year and their implications for family offices. Following is a summary of their conversation. What will the major trends for investors be in 2021? COVID-19 will continue to be a major theme, both short-term and long-term. We're optimistic that as the vaccine rollout continues to gather steam, it will have a significant impact on markets and economies. Combine that with fiscal stimulus in the U.S., plus very accommodative central banks that are committed to limiting the rise of yields, and we're positioned for a pretty robust recovery in the second half of the year. Between now and then, there may be some volatility. But in general, the market is looking beyond a lot of the short-term concerns about COVID toward a second half of the year that will provide a favorable environment for risk assets. We're also seeing COVID accelerate some trends that we'd already begun to notice. For example, we see the U.S. continuing to have a more expansive relationship with China, and we see technology emerging as a long-term winner. In addition, we think the market has not effectively priced in a lot of risk associated with climate, and we're trying to get ahead of the curve on sustainability issues. Given the low-rate environment, where can investors go for yield? Historically, yield-oriented investments have been focused on fixed income. But yields on fixed income have been very low recently, whether we're talking about Treasuries or corporate bonds, and our view is that they're likely to remain low for the foreseeable future. Fixed-income investments traditionally serve two main roles in portfolios: yield and diversification. When today's investors chase yields, they often move into asset classes that are less diversifying. The challenge is to find new sources of yield that also offer a measure of diversification. Emerging markets present one opportunity, particularly in illiquid markets. For example, private credit in Asia offers very attractive yields along with diversification benefits. China bonds also provide a yield pickup and are somewhat diversifying. What are some of the other big themes you're emphasizing in 2021 portfolios? Sustainability is a major theme. Historically, sustainability hasn't been a primary concern in portfolio construction. We're moving it into the forefront of our thinking. Our work is grounded in the view that climate risk is an investment risk, and we're incorporating sustainability into forward-looking return expectations. It's worth mentioning China again. We think China is significantly underrepresented in investment portfolios. China is responsible for between 15% and 18% of global GDP, but it represents only about 5% of global equity markets. So, there's a real disconnect between the economic impact of China and how it's accessed by investors. We think investors are under-allocated in illiquid investments across the board. It's becoming more challenging to generate really high rates of return in public markets, so when we're constructing portfolios we're looking at illiquid investments as a primary growth driver. Private equity, private credit, and infrastructure, for example, all provide distinct opportunities for investors, and we're including them strategically in our clients' portfolios based on their particular return targets and risk tolerance. We're also looking at certain factor exposures to make sure investors have exposure to a broad basket of securities that will participate in a robust economic rebound, which may mean focusing more on value or on a cyclical orientation. What's your thinking about valuations in the coming year? It depends on your metric, and it depends on the market you're talking about. For example, if we're talking about the S&P 500, that asset class looks richly valued across multiple metrics. Then again, if you look at it relative to the free cash flow that the companies are generating, and also relative to an opportunity set in which yields are so incredibly low, the valuations don't look as stretched. Furthermore, if you look at the equity market you can identify particular parts that are not overly valued. That is why it's important to identify different themes and sectors that are attractive within equities. We're thinking about cyclical securities that we think will participate in a rebound but are not richly valued at this stage. \"},\n",

       "  'content': \" Sustainable investing is reaching an inflection point for family offices. Four out of five family offices are engaged in some form of sustainable investing, according to BlackRock's recent Global Family Office Survey. This figure represents tremendous growth over the past several years, during which time family offices have moved from learning about sustainable investing to actively incorporating it. They are embracing two strategies in particular: climate strategies and impact strategies. Climate strategies focus on avoiding climate related risks and investing in companies positioned to capture opportunities related to the transition to a net zero economy. Impact strategies have the dual objective of delivering financial returns and creating measurable positive environmental or social outcomes. As part of a recent webcast series in partnership with BDO United States, Alexandra Hirsch, a Director on the BlackRock Sustainable Investing team, spoke about these strategies with Jessica Huang, Head of Sustainable Investment Solutions for Americas and Japan. Following is a summary of their conversation. Why is climate change such an area of interest for family offices? Climate change is becoming impossible for investors to ignore. The U.S. alone in 2020 had 22 climate-related weather disaster events that exceeded USD$1billion of damages.1 So, individuals are starting to see the effects of climate change in their day-to-day lives. Meanwhile, 127 governments from the U.S. to China are moving toward net-zero economies, meaning they will balance emissions produced with emissions removed from the atmosphere. And combatting climate change is a primary concern not just for governments but for private companies: Over 1,100 companies have committed to or are considering net-zero targets. The transition to net zero presents an amazing opportunity for investors to reallocate capital to companies and sectors that are poised to benefit. We don't believe that the markets are fully pricing in information about sustainability. We have updated our capital market assumptions to fully incorporate climate considerations, which will allow us to more accurately estimate the long-term prices of assets and better position our clients' portfolios. At BlackRock, we're also developing a heightened scrutiny model across our active investment portfolios to look at our environmental, social and governance (ESG) integration efforts, and we're embedding climate into our broader sustainability platform. All new sustainable strategies will include a climate objective like reduced carbon emissions intensity or increased exposure to companies capturing climate-related opportunities. We're also building innovative new investment solutions that are aligned with the specific temperature goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. What part of impact investing is of most interest to family offices? What is ESG versus impact investing? One of the best explanations is that ESG is what happens within the walls of a company, and impact is what happens outside the walls of a company. At BlackRock, we offer ESG strategies that invest in companies that perform better on operational issues related to environmental, social and governance. And we also offer impact strategies that are designed with the intention to generate positive, measurable social or environmental impact alongside financial returns. With family office clients, we're seeing a lot of interest in impact investing with regard to both climate and social issues. On the climate side, the focus is very much on renewable energy. At BlackRock, we're already one of the world's largest investors in renewables, but historically our platform has focused on OECD countries. As we think about the global transition to a net zero economy, we also need to support emerging markets. So, we've partnered with the governments of France and Germany as well as a multitude of foundations to create an innovative, blended finance solution that will invest in renewable energy infrastructure across emerging markets. On the social side, we're seeing particular interest in racial and diversity issues. The events of the past summer increased interest in investing to address the racial equity gap in America. There weren't that many strategies that focused on this issue, so we decided to develop an impact strategy that provides funding for minority-owned businesses and communities that historically have been undercapitalized. Are sustainable strategies delivering returns commensurate with traditional strategies? This is a question we get all the time. Looking back ten-plus years ago, most investors in sustainable products were thinking mainly about moral and ethical considerations, which meant they avoided or screened certain issuers or industries. The space has evolved so much. Now sustainable strategies are focusing on using environmental, social and governance data to identify better-run companies—companies that are addressing the needs of all their stakeholders and also thinking about their environmental footprint. And so, when you look at the analysis coming out of the industry more recently, most most of it is showing that there's no difference in performance between sustainable and traditional strategies. In fact, sometimes there's actually an edge for sustainable strategies. During the first quarter of last year, when the Dow Jones dropped about 10,000 points, 94 percent of sustainable indices outperformed their parent benchmark. And over 80 percent of them maintained that outperformance throughout 2020.4 Beyond that, we've found that ESG funds generally provide downside risk protection over even longer periods, such as three, five or ten years. At BlackRock, we design impact strategies that meet the same bar of competitive market rate returns, in addition to contributing to measurable positive environmental or social outcomes. The reason we're able to do this is because our impact companies actually had twice the sales growth of the companies in the broader global equity universe. That's because these are companies that are solving the world's greatest problems, issues such as affordable housing, health care, education, and financial inclusion, and so they're exposed to huge structural growth tailwinds. What is the future of sustainable investing? There are two main takeaways: Sustainable investing is on the rise There’s a lot of room for innovation The first is that we're seeing real dollar flows. In 2020, we saw USD$280 billion move into sustainable ETFs and mutual funds globally.2 But we're still in the early stages of sustainable investing. In a recent survey, of 425 investors around the globe, representing USD$25 trillion of assets, said they expect to double their sustainable allocations over the next five years. And this trend was echoed in our family office survey, which found that 75 percent of family offices expect to increase their exposure to sustainable strategies in the coming year. The second takeaway is that there's a lot of room for innovation when it comes to sustainable strategies. As we get better data and better technology, as we get smarter about measuring environmental and social issues, we're going to be able to develop more advanced solutions. At BlackRock, we're trying hard to keep up with client demand. In 2020, our platform doubled in assets under management, and we almost doubled the number of strategies on our sustainable platform.3 As we look toward 2021 and beyond, we're going to continue to innovate in that space. \"},\n",

       "  'content': ' We saw yet another local high in 10-year Treasury yields last week, briefly touching above 1.60% intraday Thursday after a weak 7-year auction led to an immediate 10+ basis point selloff. This was the new largest single-day selloff since mid-March 2020, and even with a modest reversal, the 10-year and 30-year yield levels stand near their highest in the past 12 months.1 Fed officials have so far not deviated from their stated comfort level regarding the move higher in yields, with Fed president Bostic reiterating the message even after the auction results.2 Corporate pension response Last week saw elevated inbound inquiry and flow into long duration assets as rising rates catalyzed substantial funded ratio improvements; as seen in the chart below, by our estimates a typical plan’s funded status may have now increased approximately 3% year-to-date as of 2/26/21, and approximately 8% since the start of the fourth quarter 2020. Estimated U.S. pension funded pension status ratio vs 30 year U.S. treasury yield Source: BlackRock, BofA Merrill Lynch. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Time series starting on 12/31/2018. Estimated Pension Funded Status is based on the average asset allocation of the US corporate defined benefit plans for which Pensions & Investments includes an asset allocation breakdown as of 9/30/2018. This asset allocation is as follows: 47.0% weight to Barclays Long Government/Credit Bond Index, 21.0% weight to Russell 1000 Index, 12.0% weight to MSCI World ex US Index, 5.0% weight to MSCI ACWI Index, 6.0% weight to S&P Listed Private Equity Index, 5.0% weight to Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index, 2.0% weight to Barclays 1-3 Month T-Bill Index. Based on the aforementioned indices, YTD as of 2/26/2021, the assets have returned -2.15%, and the liabilities have returned -5.18% resulting in a funded ratio increase of 2.82%. Based on the aforementioned indices, as of 9/30/2020, the assets have returned 5.95% and the liabilities have returned -3.33%, resulting in a funded ratio increase of 7.97%. No allowance has been made for active management or costs. Asset returns are based on the historical levels of the aforementioned modelled indices. Liability returns are based on the historical levels of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Mature US Pension Plan AAA-A Index. The assumed funded ratio is sourced from the Milliman Corporate Funding Study on the 100 largest US corporate defined benefit pension plan sponsors as of 12/31/2020. Flows found their way into government and credit sectors, the following is our views and analysis based on BlackRock clients: Plans that have been historically light on credit have added in order to meet new capital and/or spread hedge ratio targets at new glide path steps, sourcing from both return-seeking assets as well as existing government holdings. Plans with dollar-for-dollar liability matched portfolios, generally allocated pro-rata into duration-neutral credit and government holdings. Plans with higher rate hedge ratio targets and/or key-rate matching needs utilized capital efficient rate derivatives. Where do things go from here? We saw support at the long-end of the Treasury curve amidst last Thursday’s selloff. Last week, the back-end of the Treasury curve outperformed the short-end as we believe investors sought to satisfy pent up de-risking needs.3 Insurance buyers were also active this week, likely taking advantage of higher yields. We suspect this long-end institutional demand will persist over the near term. Nuances in supply and demand, liquidity and transaction costs have been increasingly prevalent in Treasury and credit markets. Prior to trading, we encourage discussion, where possible, with a BlackRock relationship manager to evaluate market opportunities and de-risking considerations. We believe the question on many investors’ minds right now is if and when the Fed will step in to provide further market support. While a possibility, we believe the rise in rates would have to begin to constrain the flow of credit to the real economy, which it does not appear to have. As we will discuss in more detail in our soon to be released Corporate Pension Themes, even in the face of rising rates, gains in funded status should continue to support allocations to long duration assets.

       "  'content': ' Insights from our survey of family offices across the globe With the severe health and economic crisis, 2020 was a year like no other, presenting investors with both challenges and opportunities. Against this backdrop BlackRock and Juniper Place are delighted to have partnered to learn more about the experiences and plans of 185 family offices across the globe. All family offices are unique, and this is reflected in how they have responded to the crisis. However, through this survey and the in-depth interviews we conducted, we have identified three key themes. Market outlook: resilience in the face of uncertainty Our survey indicated that despite a challenging economic outlook, few family offices felt the need for material change to their portfolio. Many family offices cited their long-term investment horizon and high allocations to alternatives as the driver of this. However, family offices have growing concerns, particularly around diversification, equity valuations, liquidity needs and the spectra of inflation. BlackRock’s Investment Institute (BII) would argue that the nature of the crisis and its long-term implications warrant a review of asset allocations. Asset allocation: the growing importance of alternatives Despite challenges, private equity remains the alternative investment of choice. Private debt, real estate and infrastructure are all seen as capable of generating long-term yields. Hedge funds appear to be enjoying a resurgence as many recognize that they could be well placed to profit from a more volatile and dispersed environment. Sustainable investing: from interest to action 80% of family offices are engaged in some form of sustainable investing and the trend looks set to continue. This is driven by the values of the next generation of family members alongside heightened public awareness. Our survey indicates family offices believe that sustainable strategies no longer require compromising investment returns. However, addressing the remaining hurdles of education and the absence of common impact measurement methodologies could lead to more widespread integration. '},\n",

We find that most are unlikely to make their return targets, but changes in asset allocation may help. Click here to download full report It’s been an unprecedented year for public pension investors. The market shock from Covid-19, and the subsequent snapback in the price of many risk assets, has provided a real-time test of plans’ strategic asset allocations and their approach to rebalancing. To gauge how likely plans are to meet their return assumptions in the years following the crisis, BlackRock partnered with Pensions & Investments to collect fund-level asset data for 69 U.S. public pensions. We then leveraged the Aladdin® platform to map each fund1 to our May 2020 capital market assumptions (CMAs) to estimate the risk and return characteristics of each plan. A different decade While nearly all plans we analyzed exceeded their assumed return targets over the last ten years, the next decade looks considerably more challenging. More than 70% of plans are expected to miss assumed returns over the next ten years, based on their current asset allocations and our CMAs1. See the Falling short chart. Falling short Assumed versus expected returns for 69 US public pension plans Source: BlackRock, Pensions & Investments. Assumed returns based on Pensions & Investments data as of March 2020. Expected returns based on BlackRock’s 10-year capital market assumptions as of May 2020. There is no guarantee that the capital market assumptions will be achieved, and actual returns could be significantly higher or lower than those shown. See table titled Benchmark Mapping & Capital Market Assumptions in the Appendix for details. When we examine the difference between plans that look set to achieve their return assumptions and those that look set to fall short, we find that those that appear more likely to achieve their target returns have significantly higher allocations to alternative assets and lower allocations to fixed income. See the Alternative outcomes chart, which breaks down the asset allocations of plans with an assumed return of 7.25%, the median of the plans we surveyed. The projected return differential between the two groups is significant: Plans that are likely to miss their target are forecast to post annual returns of 6.77%, vs. 7.97% for those that are likely to achieve their target. Alternative outcomes Asset allocations of U.S. public pension plans with 7.25% assumed return targets Source: BlackRock, Pensions & Investments, March 2020. The primacy of private markets Our capital market assumptions strongly favor private markets, while projecting muted, and in some cases negative, returns for many fixed income assets. Given the extremely low level of benchmark interest rates, and policymakers willingness to keep them ultralow for years to come, we think that plans with relatively high exposures to fixed income should consider reallocating a portion of their portfolios to private markets. Of course, closing the gap between expected and assumed returns is not simply a matter of decreasing allocations to fixed income and increasing allocations to private markets. When investing in private markets, sourcing the right assets, building a diversified portfolio, and paying an appropriate level of fees are all paramount to delivering on the promise of private assets. Another consideration in private markets investing is illiquidity, but we believe many plans may be overestimating the liquidity risks. To quantify this risk, the BlackRock Investment Institute performed a simulation based on a historical period of extended market stress: the global financial crisis. The simulation assesses how much an investor can allocate to private markets before running into problems meeting total portfolio spending requirements and capital calls from funds. The implications are striking, as they suggest that the ceiling for private market allocations may be higher than is often assumed—and may be even higher if the private markets allocation tilts towards income-earning assets. For pension plans, increasing allocations to private markets could be the deciding factor in meeting return objectives over the next decade. But not all private market assets are created equal. If we break down the private markets allocation of plans with 7.25% assumed returns, we find that the plans that are forecast to achieve their return objectives have their largest overweights to private credit (+9.07%) and private equity (+6.32%). Of course, private markets don’t offer a panacea for public pensions. But we do think they represent an important component of a strategic plan for the next decade, along with a host of other factors including a thoughtful and flexible approach to holistic asset allocation and a continuous understanding of portfolio risk exposures.

       "  'abstract': 'We examine the impact of recent volatility on the funded status, asset allocations and active risk of U.S. corporate pensions.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Q1 2020 market impact As anxiety about COVID-19 escalated toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, global equity markets fell precipitously, rates across the US Treasury yield curve fell below 1%, and credit spreads widened to levels not seen since the Global Financial Crisis. While the impact of the outbreak may be sharper and deeper than many originally anticipated, we do not see this as a repeat of 2008. The broader economy was on firmer footing before the outbreak, and the monetary and fiscal policy responses have been massive and swift. Amid the volatility, we must be mindful of how market fluctuations create imbalances relative to a corporate pension plan’s strategic asset allocation (SAA) and liability-hedging objectives. Given the magnitude of the decline and the elevated transaction costs involved in rebalancing, investment decisions made during these times may be some of the most critical in shaping the portfolio’s path forward. This analysis reviews the Q1 2020 market impact on plan funded status as well as the level of active risk relative to the original asset allocation from different rebalancing practices. To help formulate the path forward, we analyze potential funded status paths based on three illustrative market recovery scenarios: As of December 31 2019, we estimate that the average corporate pension plan was approximately 89% funded, with an average asset allocation of 41% equities, 46% fixed income, 11% alternatives and 2% cash1 . However, market volatility during the first quarter of 2020 may have severely impacted those figures. To gauge the impact, we conducted an analysis based on the average allocation of corporate plans, assuming the fixed income portfolio was invested in long government/credit exposures. This modeling results in approximately 50% interest rate hedging relative to the liability on a dollar-duration basis. Additionally, as many plans have implemented custom liability-driven investment (“LDI”) strategies in recent years, we modeled another allocation where the fixed income portfolio was invested in a custom LDI strategy that targets higher interest rate hedge ratios. We assumed the custom LDI strategy invested approximately half of the fixed income portfolio in long credit, while the remainder utilized interest-rate-linked instruments to achieve 85% interest rate hedging relative to the liability on a dollar-duration basis. While the experience of individual plans varied widely depending on SAAs, plan statuses, hedging programs, and contribution policies, our scenario analysis estimates that plans that hedged more interest rate risk did better, and a few well-funded plans with most of their assets in LDI strategies saw funded status improve. Our analysis indicated the following findings2 : The average plan experienced a 9% decline in funded status, representing a one standard deviation movement based on expected funded status volatility. Plans with custom LDI allocations fared considerably better. They experienced only a 2% decline in funded status, representing a 0.3 standard deviation movement based on expected funded status volatility (See the A historic selloff chart). The average US company saw its pension liabilities jump to 57% of market cap by the end of March, more than double the amount at the beginning of the year. (See the Growth in pension materiality chart). Liabilities fell modestly as falling rates were offset by widening spreads, and market caps shrank in the equity sell-off.

PBO liability returns based on the historical levels of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Mature US Pension Plan AAA-A Index from 1/1/2020 to 3/31/2020. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Additionally, given the speed at which the recent market volatility transpired, asset allocations have likely drifted significantly for those plans that have not rebalanced. For the average allocation, this has resulted in overweight positions to fixed income and cash/cash equivalents of approximately 7%, and corresponding underweight positions to equities and alternatives. Meanwhile, plans with custom LDI allocations may be approximately 10% overweight in fixed income, and underweight an equivalent amount in equities and alternatives. The Massive drift chart highlights how far away from benchmarks plans may find themselves. As this simulated analysis is based on economic proxies of underlying investments, actual results for private market investments may take several quarters to flow through to reported returns and the impact to investors may differ. For plans utilizing custom LDI strategies, rebalancing frequency, capital efficiency and instrument flexibility could have led to vastly different outcomes as transaction costs, even in the most typically liquid securities, spiked amid the volatility. For example, 30-year Treasury bond bid-ask spreads rose from 0.2 - 0.5 basis points in early March to 6 - 7 basis points on March 20.3 Investment grade credit bid-ask spreads rose from 2 - 3 basis points and peaked at 37 basis points over a similar time frame4.

Please see Appendix for more details, including the benchmarks that BlackRock assigned to each asset class. Shaping the recovery Market drawdowns and recoveries have taken various shapes historically. To help plan the path forward, we have illustrated potential L-shaped, U-shaped, and V-shaped asset recovery scenarios and analyzed the impact on pensions over time. Depending on the shape of the recovery, some pension plans may regain their pre-stress funded status levels in about a year, or more gradually over time. The Recovery shapes and sizes chart highlights the funded status impacts of pension portfolios under the different market recovery scenarios. Recovery shapes and sizes Illustrative asset recovery scenarios and potential impact on funded status Source: BlackRock, April 2020. Recovery scenarios are for illustration purposes only; this information does not reflect any specific account or portfolio. Recovery scenarios are approximated by shocking MSCI ACWI by +/-10% for each incremental 7% market move; change in funded status assumes assets and liabilities are shocked by amount of stress PnL. Robust portfolio construction and risk management are of utmost importance, particularly during such volatile periods. With declines in funded status, and potential reductions in voluntary contributions, pension plans may need higher returns to achieve funded status objectives. As a result, many plans will need to reassess their SAA and LDI programs to ensure they are taking the appropriate level of risk to efficiently achieve the desired end-state targets. Additionally, portfolios that drift with the market and are not rebalanced may result in concentrated positions that deviate from the SAA. We estimate that pensions that have not rebalanced their portfolios in response to recent market moves may be inadvertently taking active risk of approximately 1.6% - 2.9% relative to their original asset portfolios (See the Why rebalancing matters chart). Once the appropriate level of strategic risk is determined, taking further active risk inadvertently may have unintended consequences. Robust portfolio and risk management programs are critical to act strategically and position for potential opportunities. We favor rebalancing toward target weights, but caution investors from making changes without considering transaction costs, market liquidity and cash requirements, among other factors. In the face of wide spreads, high issuance, and Fed support, plans that use custom LDI strategies may want to consider the tradeoffs between rates and credit exposure, if capital-efficient exposures can be used to potentially improve the overall yield. The Opportunistic credit allocation in LDI chart highlights the potential benefits of adding to credit, particularly if investment grade spreads continue to narrow toward pre-crisis levels. While we believe it may be too soon to overweight equities, it may be prudent to start leaning against market moves through rebalancing as well as positioning to take advantage of market dislocations, particularly in credit and private markets.

       "  'content': ' Beyond fully funded Corporate pension plans have had an incredible year, with funded ratios up +11.1% as of December 31, 2021 according to BlackRock’s U.S. Pension Funding Update. Following a +2.7% funded ratio gain in 2020 (including a +13.8% rebound from March 2020 lows), the average plan is now 99.3% funded on a PBO basis as shown below – the highest level since the 2008/09 financial crisis and well within sight of being fully funded. Average PBO funded ratio up +11.1% in 2021 (not including contributions) Source: BlackRock U.S. Pension Funding Update In this paper, our fourth annual corporate pension themes publication, we encourage all U.S. corporate plans to begin thinking beyond fully funded across four dimensions: Glidepath design: Fully funded does not mean fully de-risked Portfolio construction: Asset classes for a de-risked portfolio Implementation: The ubiquitous importance of daily monitoring, technology, and expanding the implementation toolkit End-game solutions: Forward planning is critical We also provide an update on a variety of plan sponsor-driven initiatives that we have touched on in prior themes publications such as closing or freezing the plan, making voluntary contributions, borrowing to fund at low yields, and seizing the sustainability opportunity which may further help progress toward funded ratio goals. Download full report Glidepath design: fully funded does not mean fully de-risked Being 100% funded on a PBO basis typically does not mean the asset allocation is fully de-risked with 100% of the assets in a liability driven investment (“LDI”) program. There are two main reasons why this is the case: The ‘end-state’ PBO funded ratio target is usually above 100%, at say 105% or higher to account for potential mismatches in actuarial assumptions vs actual experience (e.g. demographics, mortality, wages, lump-sum take rates, and plan expenses), disconnects in asset performance vs liabilities where the latter is not subject to downgrade or default risk , and potential premiums in the event of a future pension risk transfer (“PRT”) to an insurance company; and Plans at 100% funded, even frozen plans with no future benefit accruals, often have liability growth rates or ‘hurdle rates’ which exceed the return available from a 100% LDI portfolio (as proxied by U.S. Long Credit bonds) which would result in a funded ratio decline over time. Fully funded does not mean fully de-risked, particularly if the plan is still accruing benefits and/or the sponsor is not contributing Hurdle rates are still well above the expected return from long bonds at 100% PBO funded Source: BlackRock. Hurdle rates reflect the required asset return to maintain 100% PBO funded based on approximate assumptions for participant count, liability cash flow profile, liability yield, service cost, PBGC premia and contributions. Numbers may not add due to rounding. Based on BlackRock’s Q3 2021 Capital Market Assumptions. Expected risk and expected returns are calculated using Aladdin Risk Model and are based on BlackRock’s capital market assumptions. Expected risk and return estimates are subject to uncertainty and error. Expected risk and returns for each asset class can be conditional on economic scenarios; in the event a particular scenario comes to pass, actual risk and returns could be significantly higher or lower than forecasted. A material growth allocation is still required for most plans at 100% PBO funded Source: BlackRock, for illustrative purposes only. Also see https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-us/insights/investment-actions/de-risking-glidepaths. Another potential argument to keep some growth assets in the portfolio for fully funded plans is the diminishing marginal benefit one gets from a surplus risk perspective when LDI assets get beyond around 75% of total plan assets, relative to the benefits realized at earlier points on the glidepath. Specifically, when moving from 75% in LDI to 90% in LDI (and 25% in growth assets to 10% in growth assets) we find that expected surplus risk for a frozen plan only declines 0.7% from 3.4% to 2.7%, whereas the expected return of the portfolio declines by 0.8%, from 3.7% to 2.9%. In other words, the expected surplus risk benefit is arguably small, relative to the give up in return, at the final glidepath step. At earlier steps on the glidepath, implementing an LDI program tends to result in materially higher surplus risk reduction per unit of return. From the sponsor’s perspective, a case can potentially be made to continue holding growth assets in an overfunded plan to generate pension income and thus improve non-operating earnings, or to generate a surplus for other uses (e.g. fund retiree medical expenses1, facilitate mergers and acquisitions2). However, we would caution investment decision makers that the ERISA fiduciary responsibility to focus on preserving benefits remains the ultimate priority when designing investment strategies for DB plans and that eventually the plan will become well-funded enough that a 90% or higher LDI allocation is warranted. We also encourage sponsors to consider the impact of “trapped surplus” in the plan, in particular the stringent rules and potential tax penalties3 if the sponsor seeks to revert surplus plan assets back to itself. Portfolio construction: Asset classes for a de-risked portfolio As pension plans de-risk, it is likely that an increasing proportion of the total $3.7 trillion in DB assets will be invested in investment grade corporate bonds to match the interest rate and spread risk in liabilities. Indeed, we calculate that U.S. DB plans already own approximately 19% all investment grade U.S. Corporate bonds in existence 5. Bond supply over the past 10 years has largely met demand with the investment grade U.S. corporate bond market growing from $2.8 trillion in 2011 to $6.2 trillion in 2021 according to Bloomberg data, but to the extent rising interest rates and higher leverage ratios start to reduce the speed of corporate bond issuance at the same time LDI allocations for DB plans are growing, issuer and sector concentration in this asset class may become a greater concern. Going forward it may be necessary to look for other asset classes that can keep up with liability growth with marginal impacts on surplus risk. We continue to believe that not all diversifying assets are created equal when considered in liability-relative terms. For example, in last years’ pension themes we highlighted that commodities are commonly considered a sound diversifying asset class in asset-only terms, but are one of the least effective in preserving funded ratios in the worst environments for DB plans – specifically when equities decline at the same time as rates decline. Unfortunately, Q1 2020 was a case-in-point where broad commodity exposures, as measured by the S&P GSCI index, dropped -42% compared to a decline in Russell 1000 Large Cap equities of -21% at the same time rates declined. In other words, commodities did not provide the diversifying protection to funded ratios when it was needed most. The need for downside protection to funded ratios becomes even more acute for well-funded plans. Instead, we prefer diversifying assets – either in the LDI portfolio or the growth portfolio – that have interest rate sensitive characteristics similar to pension liabilities. Some may still suffer low or negative returns if equities sell off and rates decline, but not as sharply from a funded ratio perspective due to a positive exposure to the rates factor. Examples include real estate, multi-sector fixed income, securitized debt, high yield, emerging market debt, and infrastructure. Private credit may also be attractive for less well funded plans that do not have immediate intention to engage in a PRT transaction or to terminate. As shown in the left panel below, investment grade corporate bond spreads are near historic lows. This may increase the urgency for plans to tilt away from these assets in 2022, and towards a broader fixed income universe such as the one shown in the right panel below for at least part of their portfolio.

Download full report Implementation: Daily monitoring, technology, and toolkit expansion As investment strategies for well-funded plans evolve from a total return “set-and-forget” approach to a dynamic LDI approach, monitoring funded ratios and key risk exposures such as interest rate hedge ratios using real-time data and flexible technology becomes increasingly critical for success. As benefits are paid, the duration of a typical closed or frozen plan declines requiring evolving LDI exposures. As shown in the left panel below, we believe capital efficient instruments still have an important role in these programs enabling plans to target specific interest rate and credit spread hedge ratios. To the extent some plans seek to evolve their credit exposures dynamically, the right panel below demonstrates that adding ETFs to the LDI toolkit can improve liquidity and materially lower transaction costs. For example, when comparing the transaction costs in March 2020 of two commonly used fixed income ETFs to the transaction costs of an equivalent basket of physical bonds, the bid/ask spread of LQD to physical investment grade credit was 3bps vs 57bps and the bid/ask spread of HYG to physical high yield bonds was 2bps vs 147bps. In other words, investors that did not use fixed income ETFs to implement tilts in March 2020 may have eliminated a material amount of the gain they anticipated when bond spreads were high because they paid such high transaction costs to increase or adjust their exposure. Capital efficient instruments allow plans to target specific hedge ratios, adding fixed income ETFs to the implementation toolkit can lower transaction costs Source (bottom): Bloomberg. BlackRock. High Yield is represented by iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG), Investment Grade Corporate is represented by iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD). We selected HYG and LQD ETFs for illustrative purposes, as these are the most commonly used instruments for credit allocations.

Download full report End-game solutions: Forward planning is critical With the average PBO funded ratio for corporate plans above 99%, we anticipate many sponsors will weigh the decision of keeping the plan on the balance sheet in a very low risk liability-matched portfolio, or seek to reduce or eliminate the plan from the balance sheet through PRT. Data from LIMRA indicates that around $35bn of pension liabilities were transferred in 2021 making it a record year for U.S. PRT activity, but this was less than 1% of total DB liabilities meaning we believe it is still early days in the trend towards PRT. The most common approach to PRT is a partial risk transfer of retiree liabilities, and pricing for these transactions is becoming increasingly more competitive with some deals priced below par (i.e. less than 100% premium vs PBO liability). However, our experience is these transactions can take a year or two to successfully implement. From an investment perspective, there is important planning work required to get the fixed income portfolio “insurance ready and as shown below, we estimate plans can save up to 98bps by transitioning assets-in-kind (rather than selling bonds and transitioning cash) to the insurance company. If there are remaining pension liabilities on the balance sheet post PRT, it is likely these will have a materially different risk profile requiring a new asset allocation policy. We believe that forward planning is critical for success in any end-game solution.

       "  'abstract': 'We assess how market volatility has impacted funded status and altered asset allocations at U.S. public pension plans.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Recent market impact As anxiety escalates regarding the outbreak of COVID-19 around the world, global equity markets have fallen sharply since mid-February. The impact of the outbreak is likely to be sharper and deeper than many anticipated. Yet we do not see this as a repeat of 2008 as the broader economic and market backdrop is on a firmer footing given the crisis was not precipitated by financial instability. Amid the volatility, we must be mindful of how market fluctuations create imbalances relative to a portfolio’s strategic asset allocation (SAA). Given the magnitude of the decline, investment decisions made during these times may be some of the most critical in shaping the portfolio’s path forward. Fortunately, portfolio and risk analytics can help investors think through portfolio construction as well as rebalancing and reallocation strategies in different economic scenarios. In the fourth quarter of 2019, BlackRock collected data from approximately 70 U.S. public pension plans as part of our annual Public Pension Peer Risk Study. Based on this data, the average public pension plan was approximately 72% funded in 2019, with an average asset allocation of 45% equities, 22% fixed income, 31% alternatives and 2% cash.1 However, recent market volatility has severely impacted those figures. Our scenario analysis estimates that pension assets have declined by approximately 27% on average.2 This decline represents a 2.3 standard deviation movement based on expected portfolio volatility. As a result, the average funded status has declined by approximately 20% (See the A historic selloff chart). Dispersion of losses among pensions has been wide, ranging from -20% to -40% of assets, and from -9% to -32% of funded status. Better funded plans experienced greater funded status declines, as assets were impacted and liabilities were assumed constant in the analysis. Plans that were in the top quartile of losses had on average an 80% allocation to growth assets, while plans that were in the bottom quartile of losses had an average allocation of 73% to growth assets (See the Wide dispersion chart). Additionally, given the speed at which the recent market volatility transpired, asset allocations have likely drifted significantly for those plans that have not rebalanced. This has resulted in overweight positions to fixed income and cash, and underweight positions to equities and alternatives (See the Massive drift chart). As this simulated analysis is based on economic proxies of underlying investments, actual results may take several quarters to flow through to reported returns, and the impact to investors may differ.

Private markets are based on proxies of underlying economic value, which may take several quarters to flow through to reported returns. Shaping the recovery Market drawdowns and recoveries have taken various shapes historically. To help plan the path forward, we have illustrated a few examples of potential recovery scenarios and analyzed the impact on pensions over time. Depending on the shape of the recovery, pension plans may regain their pre-stress funded status levels in about a year, or more gradually over time (see the Why rebalancing matters and Recovery shapes and sizes charts). Prudent portfolio construction and risk management is of utmost importance, particularly during such volatile periods. With significant declines in funded status, pension plans may need to reassess their SAA in order to ensure they are taking the appropriate level of risk to achieve their assumed returns required for full funding. Investment decisions made during these times are critical and can significantly drive future outcomes. What worked in the past may not necessarily work going forward, either due to the sheer size of market moves or due to changes in medium-term macroeconomic assumptions. Building portfolio resilience into an SAA is imperative, and it goes beyond diversification of asset classes. A well-constructed SAA analyzes portfolio risks from various factors and incorporates uncertainty around the future path of assets, including downside scenarios and scenarios beyond those observed historically. Additionally, portfolios that drift with the market and are not rebalanced may result in concentrated positions that deviate from the SAA. We estimate that pensions that have not rebalanced their portfolios in response to recent market moves may be inadvertently taking approximately 1.5% of active risk relative to their original portfolios (see the Why rebalancing matters chart). Once the appropriate level of strategic risk is determined, taking further active risk inadvertently may have unintended consequences. We favor rebalancing toward target weights. While we believe it may be too soon to overweight equities, it may be prudent to start leaning against market moves through rebalancing as well as posturing for potential opportunities. We caution investors from making changes without considering transaction costs, market liquidity and cash requirements, among other factors. There is no silver bullet for investors, much less for public pensions in general. However, leveraging portfolio and risk management analytics to evaluate portfolios may help investors plan for different economic scenarios, with the goal of bringing plans closer to full funding over time.

       "  'content': \" Participants may be worried. Even if their job is secure, they may face economic hardship if a family member is laid off or loses income due to a slowdown. If the worst happens, they may look to their retirement plan as a source of financial relief. Now is the time to get out in front of participants with straight talk about taking money from their retirement plan. Borrowing or withdrawals after a steep market decline can amplify all the drawback of a loan – in effect, they may be selling out when the market’s low and buying back in later, when it may be higher, or not buying back at all. The ability to access retirement assets may be important for participants’ peace of mind, but it’s critical they make an informed choice. While plan sponsors should review the plan's rules to help prepare their communications, the FAQs below may offer a starting point for addressing participant inquiries. Are you thinking about taking money from your retirement plan? Anyone can face unexpected financial difficulties. Here are a few things to consider before making a decision. Take a look at the plan's rulesFor loans, make sure you are aware of the maximum amount, repayment terms and timing. For hardship withdrawals, confirm that you meet the applicable eligibility criteria. Think about your long term goalsNo matter what stage of life you're in, it’s important to think about retirement savings as your paycheck after you retire. Letting your savings grow today can help you feel more comfortable down the road. Are there other sources of emergency funds?Personal or equity loans, or loans from a family member instead, would leave retirement funds in place to build for your future. Potential financial implicationsIt's important to consider all the possible implications of taking a loan or withdrawal. For instance, borrowing after a severe market decline may “lock in” losses if you are not invested during a market rebound. In effect, you may be selling low and buying high. Remember: Unrepaid loans may be treated like income.If you leave your job with an unpaid loan, it may be treated – and taxed – as income, potentially adding another cost. In addition, early withdrawal penalties may apply to unpaid loan balances if you are under 59 ½.

       "  'abstract': 'Q&A with Stanley Fischer on how central banks should react to the coronavirus shock.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Dr. Stanley Fischer has had a highly distinguished career as a policy-maker, including as Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Governor of the Bank of Israel, and Number 2 at the IMF. In these positions, he accrued experience through virtually every single financial crisis over the last 30 years – from SARS and MERS to the Global Financial Crisis, and now comes COVID-19 and some market moves unseen since 2008. With his decades of experience across the spectrum of market scenarios, Stan sat down with Isabelle Mateos y Lago to discuss how Central Banks, in both developed and emerging markets might want to deal with the current market environment. Capital at risk. All financial investments involve an element of risk. Therefore, the value of the investment and the income from it will vary and the initial investment amount cannot be guaranteed. Interview with Dr. Stanley Fischer about central banks and the coronavirus outbreak, COVID-19 As a central banker, how would you think about the impact of the coronavirus on the economy? Is it a supply shock, a demand shock or a financial shock? SF: The impact of the virus is a combination of a supply shock and a demand shock. There has been subsequent agitation in the financial markets, but markets broadly reflect supply and demand shifts, among other economic factors. At this stage it is not clear that it qualifies as a financial shock. So what should monetary policy agents do? Especially in countries that are not or not yet facing an epidemic at home: should they act pre-emptively, wait and see if there is an economic impact, let other actors like the government move first? Different G7 central banks have chosen different answers to these questions. Who’s right? SF: We know that crises take longer to develop than one would expect, yet when they actually happen they are much worse than expected. Dealing with the epidemic itself is out of the hands of the central banks. Public health responsibilities reside with the National Institute of Health, the Center for Disease Control and other such institutions. But the central banks have got to do what they can, which basically is to cut interest rates. There has been a lot of hesitation in responding to the virus’ impact. But there should not be a large lag between an event and a response. “Wait and see” is not the right way of doing stabilisation policy. In the Eurozone, given different countries use the euro, there is even more reason to act rapidly, to do what is best to support average economic conditions. Once central banks have decided on rates, banks and the private sector have greater capacity and can contribute to the improvement of the economy. Rate cuts or increases may occur in response to any disturbance. The disturbance we are now experiencing is broadly sectorial, however. When industries are truly in trouble, like during the global financial crisis, policy aid for certain sectors or employers makes sense. Naturally there is more room for the private sector to play in dealing with these types of demand and supply shocks. In this context, broad tools such as interest rate cuts often do not solve sectorial issues per se. Still they can help deal with the uncertainty of what the economic impact is going to be. Assuming most DM central banks end up cutting rates in response to this pandemic, should we worry that they will become impotent, cutting rates to or below zero, and run out of tools to fight the next downturn? What happens then when the next downturn arrives? Shouldn’t CBs that ease now hurry to re-normalize if/when a V-shaped recovery arrives, like most now expect? SF: Theoretical economic literature states, perhaps surprisingly, that the rate of interest rate adjustments should accelerate as it gets nearer to zero. However, this result precludes keeping interest rate ammunition for future disturbances. If we knew what the renormalisation was going to look like and when it would occur, we could act quickly. But it is essential that we maintain some capacity for dealing with future shocks. Having interest rates too close to zero is neither comfortable nor fair to future generations and subsequent central bankers. If the economy is still growing at a reasonable rate post-shock, rates can go back up. But it is always a matter of balance and we are never sure where the bottom is. At times, you think you have reached it – but then the economy proves you wrong. Of course, negative rates are not impossible. In fact, I think they do what they’re supposed to do. The Swiss used them in the 1970s to keep foreign capital out. If you wanted to invest in a Swiss bank at that time, they taxed you, which is the same thing as a negative interest rate. It worked. Recently, the most extensive application of negative rates has been conducted by the Swedes and the Swiss. I used to say when I talked about this, if you’re going to try something and other people are doing it, be sure to check whether those folks are sensible or not. In the case of the Swiss and the Swedes, you couldn’t choose two more sensible peoples. Then you might think, maybe it isn’t as stupid as it sounds. It’s still hard for others to do because it is countercultural. We have been very lucky in the Fed and the Bank of England, in that we did not have to go to negative numbers. Emerging Markets assets have been relatively resilient so far in this market turmoil. In fact, up until the latest oil shock, they have generally not had to contend with meaningful capital outflows or FX depreciation. How do you see EM central bank policies evolving? SF: Emerging markets represent a large group of distinct economies, many of which have behaved well and kept some capacity for dealing with future shocks. It can be challenging to compare emerging market economies as they are all, to some extent, different. The oil shock shows among other things that there will be differences between what these economies should be doing. However, it is desirable that these countries consult each other. I am not sure they would like to constitute themselves as a group comparable to the G7 to coordinate their policies just yet, but that might happen in the future. These conversations are not likely to occur as part of the G20. During a future financial crisis, I think EM countries would likely work together, but we are not there yet. However, we should not underestimate the length and importance of the current crisis; every day a new country is hit by the virus, and plunging oil prices represents challenges for some and advantages for others. The combination of oil and COVID-19 shocks could ultimately be a wide-spread crisis, which would require EM countries to start acting in a coordinated fashion. Some EMs have seen large currency moves, including Brazil, South Africa, Chile, Russia and now Mexico. If and when such pressures do arise, do you think CBs should intervene to resist depreciation or preserve their FX reserves? SF: I think the first instinct should be to let the market deal with it. But if the market is being very unstable and is not going where you wanted it to go, then you might well want to intervene at some point. There was one occasion in my career, at the Bank of Israel, when we broke the rule of no intervention in the foreign exchange market. That rule had been in place for over 10 years. The Israeli economy was rather stable in the context of the global financial crisis, but foreign exchange was coming into the country in increasing amounts. The last thing you need when everyone is broke is an appreciating currency. It took some time to persuade my colleagues to intervene, and we used the critique from rating agencies stating that Israeli reserves were too small as an additional rationale to change the rule. Selling shekels for USD and EUR allowed us to raise our reserves. The right answer depends in no small part on other currencies in your peer group. You do not want to be the only one depreciating. Fundamentals also need to be in good shape for the policy responses to deliver as intended. Some EM countries like Russia, South Africa and Chile often see large moves in their currency. But none of these economies are lacking sophistication on how to deal with second and third order effects. It should not be assumed that currencies in EM countries are fragile. Some EM currencies have been less volatile than some DM currencies. If you can intervene on your exchange rate and hold it at the desired level, it might even make sense to do so, even when it means temporarily having somewhat lower reserves than would be optimal. Some countries get an output advantage after depreciating successfully – so they have flexibility in the amount of reserves they should hold. Key takeaways The coronavirus is causing both a demand and a supply shock to the economy. Central Banks are not the primary responders but should respond with broad-based easing measures. Emerging markets may yet be more challenged than they have been so far. EM Central Banks would benefit from coordinating their policy responses, notably regarding how much FX depreciation to allow. Intervention may be helpful, even if it means reserves temporarily drop below their desired long-term level. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Income, plan design and open MEPS top agenda… along with recordkeeper questions Barbara Novick, BlackRock’s Vice Chairman and head of the Global Public Policy Group, called the SECURE Act “our greatest opportunity in over a decade to improve retirement security for millions of Americans.” The question is what are the opportunities, and how can plan sponsors, advisors, and consultants take advantage? The SECURE Act is wide ranging, but for defined contribution (DC) its impact is focused on access, income, and outcomes. We’ll take a look at each area, but first, let’s summarize some key provisions: Safe harbor in selecting lifetime income providers: Plan sponsors may now enjoy safe harbor protection (assuming specifications are met) when selecting lifetime income providers. Income disclosure: Requires converting asset balances to lifetime income projections on benefit statements. Income portability: Ensures that lifetime income products can be transferred between plans if participants change employers. Raises auto-escalation cap: Automatic escalation safe harbor is now 15% instead of being capped at 10%. Allows “open” MEPs: Multiple Employee Plans (MEPs) are no longer restricted to businesses that meet a commonality requirement (for example, a common owner), making it easier for small companies to band together to offer employees a retirement plan. Expands access: Tax credit for new plans, simplified reporting requirements, and provisions for long-term part time workers encourage more companies to add plans or extend coverage. A cautionary note: while provisions are immediately effective, recordkeepers may not have had the time build the infrastructure to support changes in distributions, new early withdrawal exemptions, and auto-escalation caps. Plan sponsors hoping to take advantage of the SECURE Act immediately may want to consider reviewing potential enhancements with their providers and recordkeepers to discuss timing and potential workarounds. SECURE advantage: income Perhaps the highest profile provisions in the SECURE Act are the safe harbor, disclosure, portability, and other guidelines around lifetime income. Plan sponsors and providers have been exploring ways to help retired participants manage retirement spending and longevity risk through lifetime income, and many are excited about being given the green light. While the income provisions are great news, they introduce a range of complications. We believe that income is as much a plan design question as it is a financial and investment challenge. We believe there are two questions plan sponsors may wish to consider for taking advantage of the SECURE Act’s income provisions: 1. What kind of income would participants want? The reason many people do not take advantage of lifetime income solutions is simple: they are complicated. There are different terms and conditions, survivor benefits, and when to purchase income, not to mention questions about how much of the portfolio to dedicate to income. Income safe harbor protection empowers a fiduciary to resolve much of the complexity for participants. Insight, including academic research, into participant preferences may help guide plan sponsors when selecting income options. One study* compared survey responses to uncover some (perhaps unconscious) biases that may be useful to keep in mind while working with potential income providers, including: Participants generally prefer annuities with medium-term period-certain guarantee, such as a 10-year period, over either longer or shorter term options. Context matters: “doing the math” to show expected payouts and other additional information helps drive adoption. Up to 20% of study participants reject all annuity options, but they appear to be largely independent of demographic and income levels are not a consistent predicter. 2. How will you nudge participants into a solution? We believe that prior to the SECURE Act, income solutions have gained little traction in DC plans because of fiduciary concerns and the failure to fully integrate the solutions into plan design. While the SECURE Act has addressed fiduciary concerns, plan sponsors may want to consider the full range of plan design and behavioral financial principles to manage critical behavioral biases. For example: Consider embedding an income solution into a target date fund to automatically grow a stream of lifetime income as retirement approaches. Design solutions that incorporate both a lifetime income base and a traditional portfolio to overcome concerns about liquidity and upside market participation. Use technology to give participants transparency into their growing income stream, and participant communications to reframe their retirement savings plan as a means of protecting their ability to spend in retirement. We believe that incorporating lifetime income solutions into a target date strategy has the potential to “check all the boxes” by integrating income into the plan design, providing transparency, and positioning income as expected end objective of the workplace plan. SECURE advantage: access Over the past twenty years, behavioral finance has driven a revolution in plan design so that many people entering the workforce today are automatically enrolled in a diversified, age appropriate investment portfolio, at a reasonable deferral rate, with automatic escalation to build their deferral rates and investment balances as their career grows. While not perfect, the DC system gives many new workers a reasonable leg up on retirement success. The problem is that the system leaves too many people on the outside. Current plan sponsors and many smaller companies may consider meeting with providers or advisors to explore: 1. Open MEPs Multiple employer plans were once limited to companies with ownership, a location, or some other factor in common. In addition, actions by one member of the MEP could negatively impact the entire plan. The SECURE Act has addressed these challenges and initiated several exciting changes. Advisors (and business owners) may wish to explore: The potential for creating economies of scale by bringing several companies together into a single MEP New tax credits for companies starting plans 2. Part-time workers Established plans for companies with long-term part time workers, such as retail and food service providers, as well as other industries, may be able to make a major positive benefit by making the plan available to them. Work with the provider to review their current workforce and estimate the impact of extending plan benefits to new classes of workers SECURE advantage: Outcomes The long time horizon in retirement saving means that seemingly small changes can have major impacts on retirement outcomes. Raising the cap on auto escalation is an example. As the illustration below shows, raising the cap from 10% to the newly approved 15% can increase retirement savings or shorten the number of years a participant needs to work to reach his or her goal. Our suggestion: Work with your provider to explore the impact raising the cap can have on a plan’s participants.

       "  'content': ' Insurers are uniquely exposed to climate-change-related risks from multiple angles, both in their underwriting and investing activities. BlackRock has performed a climate scenario analysis on US insurers’ portfolios in order to help investors understand climate risks and adapt investment strategies to manage them. To what degree? The implications of climate change are playing out across two broad channels: physical and transition related. Physical risks of climate change manifest in the form of rising sea levels, droughts, wildfires and storms, as discussed in BlackRock’s Getting physical. Transition risks (and opportunities) play out along technological, regulatory and social channels. Insurance companies are exposed to both these types of climate-risks. In this piece, BlackRock aims to focus specifically on these transition risks on investment portfolios for insurers by performing scenario analysis on investment portfolios. The 2° Investing Initiative (2°ii) produces climate and long-term metrics on a global scale. We used the data they provided, combined with BlackRock’s asset-level expertise and climate modeling capabilities, to examine the transition risks faced by investment portfolios. Key takeaways The first step in understanding climate risks in portfolios is to gain an understanding of what the portfolio owns. While climate scenarios are not predictions, the analysis of how a portfolio is aligned with forward versions of economies under a 2-degree transition can help investors contextualize this risk. While insurers have a multitude of factors to consider, climate risks have evolved from long-term to medium-term issues. Analysis such as this, which demonstrates a five-year outlook, should lead investors to re-examine holdings as they determine how likely we are to achieve the goals set by the Paris Climate Agreement, or how likely technology or consumer preferences will affect certain sectors. Once an assessment has been made on material climate risks in the portfolio, insurers can start to craft company ESG policies, or at minimum create a timeline of milestones needed. Through analysis such as this our goal is to educate clients to make deliberate choices, rather than be victim to unintended consequences. Download now '},\n",

       "  'content': ' We believe it’s imperative to explicitly recognize the uncertainty inherent in return estimates when building resilient portfolios. Here’s what insurers should consider. Lower-for-longer, again… Since the global financial crisis, investors have slowly adjusted to a lower-for-longer environment for interest rates. This adjustment is particularly challenging for insurers given the need to meet both liabilities and capital requirements. Within these constraints, insurers are exploring new ways of meeting their goals, whether it is expanding their fixed income toolkit or integrating alternatives into their portfolio as evidenced by the results of this year’s Global Insurance Report. The recent further leg-down in government bond yields and a return to central bank easing have exacerbated the challenge they face. Fundamental questions need some answers first: Do these renewed yield pressures materially challenge our asset allocation philosophy, especially the investment rationale for government bond allocations? And should this then entail a different approach to portfolio resilience? How to build portfolio resilience: The BlackRock approach While the central bank policy reset is supportive of risk assets in the near term, it has not removed the significant geopolitical and macro uncertainty that is driving the acute need for portfolio resilience. Focusing on simple median return estimates can lead investors astray: It is akin to having one foot in freezing water, one foot in boiling water – and on average feeling fine. Recessions are binary, not average outcomes. Traditional portfolio optimization techniques, because of their sensitivity to small changes in the assumed inputs, often force investors to place significant, subjective constraints around the optimization process. That tries to fix the symptoms rather than the root problem, in our view. Our new capital market assumptions (CMAs) and portfolio construction toolkit seek to tackle these shortfalls head on by offering: An entire range of potential return paths across asset classes and factors, allowing for a fuller picture of the uncertainty inherent within those expectations. A term structure of returns from five years to a long-term equilibrium, making it possible to map potential outcomes over any time horizon. A framework that incorporates explicit connections between asset price behavior through our new models. A change in the macroeconomic environment, such as a structural decline in real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates, should affect the expected returns of all assets. These linkages, combined with our varied return pathways, allow us to design portfolios that take into account downside risks and bring transparency to the drivers of portfolio construction. We believe that the incorporation of uncertainty in return estimates, the interconnection of estimates and return term structures, and robust optimization are all essential components of truly resilient portfolios. Does the dovish turn by central banks change the message? Our multi-asset strategic asset allocation (SAA) preferences reflect: A lower-for-longer environment – our capital market assumptions reflect our base case of modest long-run growth, a continued demand for safe assets, and inflation remaining well anchored. Heightened geopolitical risks – our allocation views are designed to provide resilience to fundamental return uncertainty stemming from geopolitical risks and the late-cycle environment in the US. They do this by considering an SAA that is resilient in a range of downside scenarios, rather than one that simply works best in a central case. Our SAA preferences show our portfolio resilience approach in action. Despite our central case of low return forecasts and an expected rise in yields, we advocated a broadly diversified portfolio with a material overweight to government bonds for unconstrained multi-asset investors in the US and Europe. This is part of a barbell strategy that upped both equity and government bond exposures at the expense of credit. Such an allocation proved to be well-suited to the sizeable market moves in summer 2019. The appropriateness of this approach for insurers will very much depend on the specific insurance portfolio. Where there is scope, however, insurers need to weigh the greater resilience potential of such a shift against the structural benefits of maintaining large exposures to credit. Sizeable allocations to private markets also remain valuable sources of portfolio returns with low correlation to public markets. What impact did the recent dovish turn by central banks have on our portfolio recommendations – and why? At a broad asset class level, the effect was limited, albeit with greater change within asset classes. From a return perspective, we had already anticipated low (real) asset returns relative to previous cycles. We now expect them to be lower still. However, what matters most from an asset allocation perspective is the impact on the correlation between key assets such as government bonds and equities because this is the driver of resilient portfolios. The diversification benefits of government bonds could be undermined in two important scenarios: If market participants thought bond yields had reached an effective lower bound (ELB) in negative territory, falling equity values would no longer coincide with a drop-in yields. That would suggest that correlations drift towards zero, thus curtailing diversification. Unwinding global supply chains and broader de-globalization could result in lower growth and higher inflation. In such a scenario, interest-rate duration risk could become positively correlated with equity, making shorter duration (or floating-rate) securities preferable to longer-duration assets – both from an anticipated returns and a risk diversification perspective. Inflation-linked bonds would become an additional, substitute diversifier. Insurers should consider the following when building portfolios today '},\n",

       "  'content': ' A “slower-for-longer” economic backdrop, political uncertainty and a reversal of the Fed-led move toward global policy normalization suggest the need for greater resilience in fixed income portfolios. We identify six themes that we believe are critical in helping to build those more resilient portfolios. Back to square one For most of the decade, fixed income investors have had to contend with an increasingly challenging rate regime. Sourcing portfolio income has become a fundamental problem given the combination of low absolute rate levels and persistent uncertainty about when and how this regime will end. Investor optimism was therefore relatively high when the Federal Reserve began to unwind its crisis-era policies at the end of 2016. In the US, in particular, this resulted in a steady climb of yields, toward – and then above – 3% with a variety of market participants targeting 4% or even 5%. Some even started to wonder whether portfolios should return to more traditional allocations, become more ‘core’ and less ‘plus’. This scenario came to an abrupt halt – and dramatically reversed – at the end of 2018, as highlighted in Figure 1. Slower than expected global growth, particularly in China, convinced the market that the Fed would have to pause and potentially return to easing. Trade tensions and political developments heightened that perception, with the messaging, and increasingly the actual policies, from global central banks eventually following suit. The market subsequently priced in over 100 bps of Fed rate cuts by year-end, with one actual cut having occurred to date, meaning global yields are now back at, or even below, 2016 levels as shown in Figure 2. Figure 1: Anticipating central bank action Source: Bloomberg, Standard & Poor’s. Data as of 2 August 2019. Figure 2: A round trip Source: Bloomberg, Standard & Poor’s. Data as of 2 August 2019. A greater need for resilience It now seems clear that any idea of waiting out the end of the low rate cycle is premature. At the same time, the economic backdrop has evolved from above-trend US growth, which supported investors’ shift from core into alternative strategies, to one where lower growth is likely. While an economic downturn or recession is not our base case, we see a ‘lower-for longer’ scenario as likely. This, in our view, calls for greater resilience. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Insurers are increasingly focused on integrating sustainability, but the perceived trade-off between sustainability and other goals remains an area of concern. We explore how insurers can enhance their resilience to climate change from both a physical and transition risk perspective, with data and scenario analysis as the common thread. Moving from avoid to advance The findings of the 2019 Global Insurance Survey suggest insurers are making steady progress on their sustainability journey. Yet this progress may be hampered by a continued belief that integrating ESG considerations into a portfolio involves compromising financial (income, alpha) or risk management (diversification) goals. On the surface, this suggests insurers remain wedded to a view that sustainable or ESG investing, is about ‘values’ rather than ‘value’. A more nuanced reading, however, may be that insurers seek sustainable outcomes alongside their traditional financial objectives. This is reflected in the significant role green bonds play – the second highest allocation intention within fixed income portfolios and the face-to-face interviews. Figure 1: Climate related risks insurers face Sources: BlackRock June 2019. Adapted from the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS)/ Sustainable Insurance Forum (SIF), July 2018: ‘Issues paper on climate change risks to the insurance sector’ available on iaisweb.org. Figure 1 summarizes the main climate change-related risks that are relevant for insurers, both on the underwriting and on the investment side. It does not represent an exhaustive analysis and is for illustrative purposes only. This echoes conversations we have with many of our clients around the world, whether it is about reconciling sustainability with their index-based approach through optimization or preparing for climate change, while keeping mainstream exposures. Our research suggests that investors do not need to choose between the pursuit of returns or the pursuit of ESG objectives. Enhanced data and insights make it possible to create sustainable portfolios without compromising financial goals. We find ESG has much in common with existing quality metrics such as strong balance sheets, suggesting ESG-friendly portfolios could be more resilient in downturns. While ESG-focused indices are young and performance histories include back-tested data, the evidence is promising and becomes even more compelling over longer time horizons as ESG-related risks tend to compound. As with other financial goals, such as diversification, there may be a trade-off between shorter-term return potential and mitigating longer-term risk. Ultimately, however, the integration of ESG considerations could lead to greater resilience. Sustainable portfolios tend to have a quality bias, meaning they may underperform in ‘risk-on’ periods, but provide greater downside protection in ‘risk-off’ scenarios. The pay-for operational excellence and reduced vulnerability to sustainability risks such as climate change is likely to increase over time and may be increased further through active management. Building resilience The role of ESG in building greater resilience is probably the most obvious in the context of climate change. Preparedness for climate change transition also highlights the challenges associated with finding a balance between different goals. Figure 1 summarizes the main challenges insurers face on both the underwriting and the investment side. From an investment perspective, we focus on two primary sources: Physical risk, which captures the impact of environmental change on financial performance. Transition risk, which captures the risks (and potential opportunities) arising from the move towards a decarbonized economy. Physical risk The cost of climate change-related events is mounting rapidly, as Figure 2 illustrates, a fact we believe investors have not fully priced into their portfolios. The BlackRock Investment Institute recently published a paper that maps the potential physical impact for a range of asset classes today and in a variety of forward-looking scenarios, including a ‘no action’ case. It underscores the importance of scenario analysis to understand these climate-specific risks and opportunities, and position portfolios accordingly. Figure 1: Mounting costs Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from NOAA National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI), October 2018. Notes: The line shows the number of climate events with losses exceeding US$1bn. The data includes droughts, flooding, severe storms, tropical cyclones, wildfires, winter storms and freezes. The bars show the total cost. The data has been adjusted for inflation using the 2018 US dollar rate. Transition risks We see the global transition to a lower carbon economy accelerate over a 5- to 7-year time horizon. Currently, most investment approaches to transition risk focus on pure divestment policies or risk mitigation through ‘low carbon’ indices, which measure absolute carbon emissions. Investors increasingly complement these with impact strategies across both public (e.g. green bonds) and private markets (e.g. renewables infrastructure). However, we think there are further steps investors can take. Mapping transition readiness: As the transition gains momentum, we think there is growing merit in systematically assessing companies’ transition readiness. Our sustainable research group has developed a proprietary framework that not only maps and compares companies’ transition risk, but also how well a company is positioned for success in a low-carbon economy. Figure 2 depicts the key pillars of the BlackRock low carbon transition framework. Mapping regulatory transition risk: Over the last decade, climate change-related regulation has moved to the top of the regulatory agenda, with the number of regulations across the 50 largest economies by GDP increasing from 10 in 1998 to over 400 in 2018 according to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI) network – and that momentum is only likely to speed up. Ensuring portfolio resilience from a climate transition perspective, therefore, also entails being able to simulate the potential impact of such regulations. We expect carbon-intensive companies in particular to face regulatory pressure. Being able, for instance, to map carbon pricing across various jurisdictions will help investors to manage those risks better and build resilience across their portfolios.

       "  'abstract': \"Insurer's complex liability profiles and regulatory and accounting constraints create additional portfolio construction considerations.\",\n",
       "  'content': ' Insurers’ complex liability profiles and regulatory and accounting constraints create additional portfolio construction considerations. We explore these below. The case for private market allocations Insurers are embracing private market assets. The reasons are by now well known: a search for higher returns given persistently low yields, a need to diversify for greater portfolio resilience, and, in certain cases, attractive regulatory capital treatment. As allocations increase, the ability to incorporate private market assets into insurers’ portfolio construction processes takes on ever more importance. This includes addressing challenges such as forming robust views on expected return assumptions, accounting for the wide dispersion of outcomes between different private market managers and considering the role of liquidity. But insurers’ complex liability profiles and regulatory and accounting constraints create additional portfolio construction considerations. We describe some of these here. Regulatory capital One key consideration is the regulatory capital charge for any given asset class. Higher capital requirements ultimately diminish shareholder returns and may hamper asset allocation due to insufficient solvency ratios. This is true for both public and private market exposures. This principle broadly applies across the various regulatory capital regimes but comes with a number of nuances for private markets. The European Solvency II regulatory regime is illustrative in this regard. Since its introduction in 2016, we have seen how changes in the standard capital charges (applicable to insurers without their own internal capital model) have increased the attractiveness of private market investment. Figure 1 summarizes most of the key changes. Figure 1: A more favorable environment Source: BlackRock Global Insurance Report, September 2019. Note: Solvency II requires insurers to hold a capital buffer, called Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) to ensure solvency in stressed market conditions. The SCR has been calibrated to ensure that insurers could meet their obligations to policyholders with a confidence level of 99.5% (similar to a 1 in 200-year event) over a 12-month period. Specific rules have been put in place to allow insurers to assign reduced capital charges to alternative assets which meet a prescribed list of characteristics. *Type 1 equity refers to equities listed on regulated markets based within the European Economic Area or a member state of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Type 2 equity covers all other types of listed and unlisted equity. Source: BlackRock, based on Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) data. Data as at August 2019. For illustrative purposes only. Portfolio construction implications First, while lower capital charges ultimately result in more attractive return on capital, the need to meet often prescriptive and detailed conditions to qualify for such beneficial treatment imposes additional governance requirements on both the insurer and their asset manager. Second, whilst Solvency II is a European regulatory regime, it is still relevant for insurers domiciled elsewhere. For example, many of the evolving regulatory capital regimes in Asia-Pacific are conceptually similar to Solvency II and often apply comparable capital charges, while many US insurers and Bermudan reinsurers have significant European operations. Finally, as these changes are partially motivated by regulators’ desire to foster greater financing of the ‘real economy’ by insurers, we could see further modifications. Deployment profile Beyond regulatory capital requirements, the differences in sourcing of private and public market exposures, also matter: Rather than buying assets immediately, as would typically be the case in public markets, purchasing private assets usually involves making upfront capital commitments to managers (or internal management teams). They then seek investment opportunities consistent with their mandate. When suitable opportunities arise, the committed capital is then drawn, often at relatively short notice. The extent to which it is possible to predict capital calls will vary by manager and asset class, but even with internal teams, complete certainty on timing is unlikely. Once deployed, capital typically cannot be withdrawn until the investment is realized, for example a loan being repaid or a privately held company being sold to another investor. Capital would then be returned to the insurer. Insurers therefore need to consider the funding of any capital calls If they fund private market allocations from an existing public market portfolio, the most natural choice may be to leave assets invested as they are. However, if asset values were to fall, there is a risk of missing capital calls, particularly if the ability to sell other parts of the liquid asset portfolio is constrained by regulatory or accounting considerations. At the other end of the spectrum, committed capital could be invested in cash. That removes the risk of missing capital calls but is likely to result in a return drag. A secondary consideration is the asset liability management (ALM) impact of holding significant allocations in cash. It is also worth noting that investments may start to be realized and capital returned before all committed capital is fully deployed. As a result, not only will the net asset value (i.e. the amount of capital invested, ignoring any investment returns) vary over time, but it may also never reach the full level of the initial capital commitment. Some investors, therefore, make additional commitments, potentially funded by any returned capital, to target a stable level of exposure to the underlying asset class. It is also the main reason why private market managers launch additional funds. Figure 2 illustrates this dynamic for direct lending and private equity, using sample data from BlackRock’s portfolio management teams. We have sought to find a pattern of ongoing commitments that broadly maintains constant exposure over time, for the horizon of the original investment. Different approaches would be possible, but it is worth noting the absolute size of these numbers: for example, an insurer wanting to maintain a constant exposure of US$1bn to direct lending would need to make additional commitments of US$1.43bn over the next seven years, on top of the original US$1bn investment. Figure 2: The commitment dynamic Source: BlackRock, as at August 2019. For illustrative purposes only. Source: BlackRock, as at August 2019. For illustrative purposes only. Portfolio construction implications While adding private market allocations should help deliver more efficient portfolios, results may differ materially depending on how committed capital is treated. Whether or not an insurer seeks to maintain a constant exposure also has major implications. To illustrate this, we first perform an optimization across public assets only (we use cash, government bonds, credit and equities), relative to a simple liability benchmark. We then introduce private market assets (private equity, infrastructure equity and direct lending), ignoring practical considerations and assuming that capital is deployed immediately, and stable exposures can be maintained over time. Single period portfolio construction frameworks used by many insurers implicitly make this assumption. Finally, we introduce a multi-period approach which explicitly captures the deployment profile of each private market asset. We do not re-run the optimization, but instead use the composition of each original efficient portfolio to explore the impact of the choices described above. The results are shown in Figure 3.

       "  'content': ' The number of climate-aware sovereign bond offerings are limited. A risk-based, carbon optimization approach may present investors with a more flexible solution for incorporating benchmark-aware climate change considerations. Using a subset of countries’ emissions data, we explore how investors can build a carbon-optimized sovereign bond portfolio without incurring a high level of active risk. Measuring emissions A country’s carbon emissions can be measured in terms of total emissions, emissions scaled by GDP or emissions scaled by population (per capita). We advocate the usage of emissions per capita to avoid penalizing less-developed countries that generally have lower GDP. Using different data providers, namely MSCI and TRACE, within our subset, Australia is the most polluting nation per capita, followed by Canada and USA, while the UK and Germany are the least polluting nations per capita. Carbon emissions for different countries Source: BlackRock, MSCI, Climate TRACE as of September 2021. Climate TRACE While we currently use MSCI sustainability data extensively across portfolios, we constantly look for new data sources to expand and enhance our sustainability insights. Climate TRACE incorporates different types of satellite imagery collected by various space agencies and commercial satellite operators. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms are “trained” to spot indicators of greenhouse gas emissions in the satellite imagery. These indicators are then used to estimate emissions by applying country or technology-specific emissions factors. Reducing emissions To investigate whether a sovereign bond portfolio’s carbon profile can be improved without adding significant active risk (tracking error) relative to an equally weighted basket (of the six countries in the chart above), we draw upon historical carbon emissions and financial data on hypothetical scenarios. Using emissions data, we aim to minimize the portfolio’s emissions while targeting various levels of active risk. Optimized exposures Our research finds the majority of carbon reduction occurs within the first 175bps of tracking error relative to an equally weighted basket. We believe it is possible to reduce carbon emissions in our hypothetical sovereign bond portfolio by almost 40% while staying within 150bps of tracking error. Beyond that point, a more concentrated portfolio with a higher active risk is required. The research shows that the reduction in emissions is of similar magnitude across data providers. Additionally, we measure the improvement of the climate change performance index (CCPI) score, which is a by-product when aiming to reduce carbon emissions. The lower the GHG emissions, the better the CCPI score, which is another measure of a country’s climate profile incorporating not only current emissions, but also energy usage, renewable energy percentage and climate policy progress.

In this paper, we explore building a Paris-aligned equity strategy as part of a broader multi-asset portfolio and the impact on alpha generation from incorporating sustainable insights. Climate-aware alpha drivers Companies meeting the ambitions set out in the Paris Agreement are increasingly benefiting from higher demand and increased firm value. Climate-aware alphas including carbon resource efficiency, green patents, and corporate target setting are linked to quality measures such as productivity and profitability. Take carbon emissions as an example – firm-level data demonstrates that companies with lower carbon intensity exhibit higher excess returns on average. These companies tend to have a lower cost of capital, higher productivity, and increased efficiency making them better positioned for alpha generation. A critical step to net zero: Decarbonization Along with analyzing carbon emissions data at the company level, incorporating carbon reduction targets at the portfolio level enhances climate outcomes and adds to portfolio returns. Using a minimum requirement of 50% relative carbon reduction vs. the benchmark along with a 7% per annum decarbonization rate allows investors to achieve a true Paris-aligned portfolio forging a path of continued reduction in carbon emissions.

In our view, a Paris-aligned framework considering sustainability alongside traditional risk and return objectives is crucial for capitalizing on the economic shift taking place. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' A decade late, a trillion short This US$1 trillion figure is based on numerous studies of climate finance needs in EMs. Estimates vary depending on the underlying assumptions and given the uncertainties around modelling climate impacts. A 2018 study puts the investment requirement for EMs excluding China at between US$0.4 trillion and US$1.4 trillion per year, while a June 2021 report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), World Bank and World Economic Forum states that over US$1 trillion per year will need to be invested in EMs through 2030 to get them tracking towards net-zero emissions by 2050. Yet these estimates largely focus on the supply-side cost of climate mitigation – that is, the measures to tackle the process of climate change. If we also consider the cost of adaptation (measures to protect against and limit the damage of realized and future climate change) and demand-side costs (such as reducing energy consumption), the figure would be significantly higher. How big is the shortfall? Even taking a conservative view of the investment need, current financing is nowhere near sufficient. In 2020, investment in decarbonization in EMs (excluding China) amounted to just US$150 billion per year – only a sixth of what’s needed. See the chart above. Some of this money comes from EMs themselves, and some is mobilized by DMs via official bilateral and multilateral channels and the private money they leverage. In 2019, DMs mobilized just US$80 billion, according to the latest OECD data. This puts DMs still some way off from meeting their commitment as part of the 2010 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). Their goal is to mobilize, from both public and private sources, at least US$100 billion per year by 2020. Even meeting this pledge won’t get us anywhere close to the at least US$1 trillion we believe is needed. Make-up of DM contribution Breaking down the 2019 DM mobilization total, the vast majority of it (over 80%) was public money, and the overall volume has grown somewhat in recent years, largely delivered in the form of loans. Only a small share of this public money – US$16.7 billion in 2019 – was actually grant-equivalent financing fueled by budgetary resources. This type of financing is crucial because it can be used to directly buy down EM risk and green technology premia. Private money mobilized by DMs declined slightly in 2019 versus 2018 – from an already low level. In 2019 less than 20% - or US$14 billion – came from private sources. But the investment needs of at least US$1 trillion per year are too high to be met by taxpayers alone. The private component needs to be massively scaled up – and rapidly, in our view, given the potential consequences of an underfunded green transition in EMs for the whole world. Unlocking private capital Mismatched resources Distribution of resources and assets in emerging and high-income economies Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, IMF, World Bank, MSCI, using data from Haver Analytics and Refinitiv DataStream, October 2021. Note: The chart shows the shares in different concepts of EMs (excluding China), China and high-income economies (i.e. rest of the world). EMs are those classified as low and middle-income countries by the World Bank. For market cap, this is the share of each group/country in total world stock market capitalization measured by the MSCI world stock market capitalization, as of 4 October 2021. For CO2 emissions, this is the share of each group/country in total world CO2 emissions in 2018 (latest data point). For GDP this is the share of each group/country in world GDP measured using Purchasing Power Parity exchange rates, as of 2019 (before the Covid shock). For population this is the share of each group/country in world population in 2020. Private capital to fund the transition is theoretically plentiful. But current strategies to entice it are not working at sufficient scale and speed. Why not? The EM investment landscape is viewed as high risk – to the point that many private investors are deterred – or prohibited – from investing in EMs. See the chart above. But these are currently undiversifiable risks: the institutional and structural reforms required to de-risk individual countries – though underway in many cases – will not happen quickly enough. No amount of clever financial engineering can address these risks, and existing approaches by multilateral organizations have not succeeded in mobilizing private capital at scale. Measures not working Existing measures to mitigate this risk have not been effective in bringing in private finance at the scale needed. Limits on current efforts to attract private capital Institutional/structural reform takes time DFI risk mitigation measures are deployed on too small a scale Public money is too targeted on funding individual projects instead of reducing broader risk Market failures, e.g. unequal access to information, impede capital flows Existing grants or grant-equivalent finance provided by developed economies is too targeted on funding individual projects – rather than being used to mitigate risks more broadly and crowd in private investment. If the pace and scale of climate flows is to pick up as it needs to, either the input of public budgetary resources needs to increase radically, or the amount of private capital that public support can mobilize will have to rise by an order of magnitude – or a combination of the two. We believe budgetary resources of at least US$100bn a year – about six times current outlays – need to be committed by countries that can afford it. The amount could be reduced if development finance institutions(DFIs) can mobilize more private capital with each dollar of public support than they currently do. But given the timescale and DFIs’ difficulty in mobilizing private capital at scale, we believe the starting point is for governments to significantly scale up budgetary allocations. Averting future losses This money should be used to de-risk projects on the understanding that it might not be seen again, rather than be spent directly on projects looking for a return. This may be seen as a huge cost for DMs, but we believe it represents an essential investment. US$100 billion per year – or US$2 trillion cumulatively over the next 20 years – is only a fraction of the losses averted by a successful climate transition. We estimate a cumulative loss in global economic output of nearly 25% to 2040 – equivalent to more than US$21 trillion of 2019 GDP. Once we move past 2040, we expect the size of avoided economic damages for actions taken now to be substantially higher. To further put this figure in context, US$100 billion per year over 20 years is only a fraction of the US$9 trillion (as at July 2, 2021) of domestic DM fiscal support provided since 2020 to cushion the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Applying the same willingness to roll out material support for climate finance could help close the funding gap in time. Design features Significant de-risking lies at the heart of any solution to mobilize private capital – and there is no way to do this without massively scaling up direct budgetary resources, in our view. In practice, mobilization could come through a number of mechanisms - and we see a number of key design features of measures that we believe will help unleash private finance at scale. De-risking Public budgetary resources can play a critical role in de-risking investment opportunities. Many of the undiversifiable risks such as country risk, could be reduced via this type of public finance – potentially unlocking substantial pools of private finance currently prevented from being invested in EMs generally. But some changes are needed to the current system in order to achieve this – for example increasing grant-equivalent funding for first loss arrangements – in which the development or public finance institution agrees to take on part of the risks of an investment, including being the first to take on losses in the event of default. Facility-level financing Budgetary resources have greatest power to scale up this de-risking by providing finance at a facility level, rather than on a project-by-project basis. This could happen in several ways, for instance by using public funding as seed capital to set up a green investment bank in an EM economy, or to fund a mechanism such as an auctioned carbon price floor which can issue an investment instrument that is bankable and which supports decarbonization without investors taking on project completion risk. The bottom line A system that meets these key requirements can help ensure that the catalytic promise of significantly higher public budgetary resources can be realized, to ultimately deliver funding on the scale and at the pace needed to fund the green transition. The examples discussed above provide some illustrations of how this could happen. In practice, a combination of measures will be needed. We have focused on measures that can be scaled up to deliver quickly, but maximizing impact per dollar spent will require significant changes to existing multilateral and bilateral delivery channels. It may even entail a complete overhaul of current institutions or the creation of new ones. That’s for governments to determine, but in any event, action needs to be taken without delay. '},\n",

In part two, the key question for investors is where and how. Here, we look across Asia, Latin America and Africa, where renewable investments are most needed and may create the most positive social and environmental impact. We also consider innovative partnership structures that bring together development capital (focused on making positive impact) and traditional capital (focused on risk-adjusted returns). Building greener economies in Asia The massive and diverse economies of Asia are expanding and maturing at a relentless pace. While this rapid industrialization is bringing beneficial growth in household incomes and economic activity, it is also adding significant disruption and stress to the local environment. In our view, there is greater urgency for the renewable energy transition in Asia, especially in high-growth emerging markets.

A cleaner path for development in Africa Africa is still relatively early in its development journey, as the region strives to lift incomes and bring the ‘next billion’ people into the middle class. While Africa is industrializing rapidly, it is still heavily constrained by inadequate and inconsistent access to electricity, not to mention prohibitive pricing in some poorer countries. There are considerable economic benefits with extending electricity network coverage, reducing power cost and improving access and reliability.

       "  'abstract': 'In this featured insight, we focus on the practical implications of moving from climate pledges to practice for multi-asset investors by sharing our preferred framework.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Multi-asset investors: Moving from climate pledges to practice The Paris Agreement seeks to reduce emissions to limit the global temperature increase. This is often equated to transitioning to a “net zero” global economy by 2050. Investors globally are focusing on decarbonization. In March 2021, 22 asset owners with US$1.2 trillion in assets committed to cutting their portfolios’ carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.1 Because so few companies are currently aligned to net zero, we believe it’s impractical to build a diversified net zero portfolio. Rather, aligning a portfolio requires a multi-year pathway. Despite potential benefits to those who are early to the era of climate investing, aligning multi-asset portfolios to net zero comes with unique challenges and is achieved by evolving the integration of ESG considerations into the investment process. A framework is, therefore, our preferred approach as opposed to a single investment decision. This framework should facilitate change but be flexible enough to adapt to the portfolio’s progress in meeting decarbonization targets. Carbon metrics across asset classes To build a portfolio that is aligned to the objectives of the Paris Agreement, we start by assessing various carbon metrics including absolute emissions and emissions intensity. For illustrative purposes, we review absolute emissions and emissions relative to enterprise value for a strategic asset allocation for a UK Defined Contribution pension scheme. We find that the two approaches are complementary. One striking observation is the absolute emissions. Getting this to net zero is a huge task. Intensity allows a more considered view as it adjusts for the size of the underlying companies on a like-for-like basis. We also observe some key implications for multi-asset investors: firstly, no asset class is the same. Different asset classes will have different pathways. Emerging markets, for example, are associated with a higher emissions intensity than developed markets. However, these carbon metrics should serve as a monitoring function rather than an input to dictate investment decisions. these metrics only show part of the picture: a historic snapshot of how these asset classes look today and therefore what the starting point is for the investor. We therefore advocate the use of these metrics for reporting and monitoring purposes. Using forward-looking metrics alongside these will be crucial in the design of the investment strategy. Evolving portfolio monitoring to include “decarbonization milestones” The design of an overarching strategy to align with the Paris Agreement will vary as a function of the portfolio’s asset allocation and investors’ different risk/return objectives. Therefore, there will be no “one size fits all” approach, although there is a common framework that multi-asset investors can apply to their portfolios. Firstly, we advocate setting interim milestones between now and 2050. The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, for example, has proposed setting interim targets for 2030 in order to reduce the uncertainty associated with achieving the appropriate “decarbonization pathway”. We also propose an annual review to ensure the portfolio is on track. This will be in part to ensure that companies who have set targets are meeting them and if not, to set a remediation process (such as through engaging with the company). It is also an opportunity to monitor whether there are new companies setting targets, since this may increase the level of confidence that the decarbonization rate can be met at the overall asset class level. An implementation plan that assesses a range of building blocks In order to build diversified portfolios, we blend index, factor and alpha-seeking strategies. Each building block has its own characteristics and complements the others. Investors can select building blocks that explicitly align with the Paris Agreement. Understanding how each asset class fares today and combining that with forward-looking decarbonization rates guides investors towards which asset classes are most crucial to replace today. Those that are not replaced may still be influenced by a clear voting and engagement policy. We use indexes in portfolio construction to access broad market exposures in a cost-efficient manner. Some screened approaches that eliminate exposure to certain business areas or optimization strategies that seek to enhance the sustainable features within a stated tracking error. Next, factor portfolios invest in broad and persistent drivers of return. Like indexes, factor portfolios can align to the Paris Agreement by systematically incorporating minimum standards for decarbonization and more. Finally, we can use alpha-seeking strategies to access exposures which contribute to the transition with the benefit of potentially brining emissions down and generating alpha. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Our approach to impact investing in public equities We believe an impact investing strategy in public equities should be built on the foundational concept of “additionality.” Additionality in this context means that, but for this contribution, that outcome would not have occurred, so impact is created. It’s key to the impact approach. Explore how innovative businesses deliver positive impact to people and the planet in two examples below. Additionality is the key to driving impact For a company to provide additionality based on our standard, a majority of its products and services must address a need that is unlikely to be fulfilled by others (such as competitors or governments), thereby creating a genuine impact that addresses that need. We also require additionality from ourselves as investors. With a long-term, ownership mindset, impact investors in public equities create impact by providing an exit for private enterprises pursuing impact; supplying the capital needed for impact companies to grow; engaging with companies to enhance impact outcomes; increasing the visibility of undervalued impact companies, and democratizing access to impact investing. At the asset class level, by offering impact investing through public equities, a broad new cohort of investors can participate and provide much needed capital to solve some of the world’s great problems. It is long past time for the democratization of impact investing. Impact on people: solutions spotlight on Bank Rakyat Based on our research as of 2020, Bank Rakyat is the largest microlender and financial services provider in Indonesia, where approximately half the adult population remains unbanked. In addition to microlending, the bank provides services including financial literacy training programs, savings vehicles and insurance products, helping to foster financial resilience, empowerment and economic opportunity for underserved communities. Bank Rakyat’s microlending business targets micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, rural communities and underserved individuals. Indonesia is an archipelago with over 10,000 islands; approximately 6,000 of them are inhabited. Due to the dispersed population across these thousands of islands, it is difficult to scale traditional business models that rely on physical locations. Bank Rakyat has built a financial agent network that allows its services to reach even the most rural areas of Indonesia’s islands, reflecting an innovative business model specific to local needs. Impact on the planet: solutions spotlight on Vestas Wind Systems As a wind energy and technology leader, Vestas designs, manufactures, installs and services wind turbines globally. It is responsible for a diverse portfolio of wind turbines that can operate in multiple environments, even in extreme weather conditions, onshore and offshore.1 Vestas’ strategy seeks to expand the world’s use of wind energy through its leading, efficient technology and lower-cost business model. Vestas’ advanced technology also increases the efficiency of renewable energy generation, with a single wind turbine producing 30 to 50 times more energy than it consumes in a lifetime.2 Wind energy grew by 23% annually between 1990-2018, and we believe wind power is positioned for continued, structural growth.3 Since inception in 1981 through 2020, Vesta’s operations have avoided 1.4 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions,4 which is the equivalent of avoiding the emissions from 1 billion passenger vehicles driven in one year.

As for climate change, the cost of not achieving the UN SDGs is greater than the cost of action. Failure to achieve the UN SDGs will have significant consequences on our collective economic, social, and environmental prospects.

For illustrative purposes only. There is no guarantee that any forecast made will come to pass. Meanwhile, advancing the SDGs could open up a whole host of opportunities as the world transitions towards a greener and more equitable economy. According to the Business and Sustainable Development Commission2, achieving the UN SDGs opens up some $12 trillion of market opportunities, representing around 60% of the real economy. While countries are accountable for their progress, we believe the private sector holds the key to unlock the world’s ability to deliver on the goals. Investors and asset owners are becoming increasingly aware of the UN SDGs as a framework for sustainable investing and are looking to understand their relevance to investment decisions. UN SDGs through the financial materiality lens As the world embarks on the transition to net zero, the necessity of adopting a fair and equitable pathway is stronger than ever. As a framework of global social and environmental objectives, the UN SDGs demonstrate the interdependencies between financial and sustainable performance. For investors interested in understanding the value that the UN SDGs can likely deliver, BlackRock’s research highlights a significant overlap between the UN SDGs and company indicators that are material to long-term financial performance. Our mapping of the 980 financially material sustainability indicators identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) to the 242 UN SDGs country indicators reveals a match as high as 70%. The SASB materiality indicators have a high correspondence with the UN SDGs Percentage of SASB materiality indicators mapped to UN SDG indicators per SICS Sector Source: BlackRock Sustainable Investing, with data from UN Sustainable Development Goals, SASB as of 31 May 2021. The SASB Materiality Map assesses material company indicators across the 11 SICS sectors, that are further expanded into 77 Industries. The 679 unique SASB company indicators are ‘activated’ across 77 Industries where there is a material connection between the company indicator and financial performance for the given Industry. This results in 980 total pairs of company indicators and industries, 687 (or 70%) of which can be linked to the UN SDGs. This graph illustrates the total number and proportion of the 980 indicators that correspond to at least one UN SDG country indicator, split across the corresponding SICS Sectors. UN Sustainable Development Goals: https://sdgs.un.org/goals. SASB Materiality Map: https://materiality.sasb.org/. Our analysis of these links also revealed that the management of negative social and environmental externalities today may become more and more material in the future as countries progress towards achieving the goals, with the majority of material sustainability indicators linking to the management of company risks and negative externalities. These results highlight that integrating the UN SDGs is therefore relevant for long-term investors to not only align their strategies with sustainable objectives, but also to incorporate associated risks and opportunities into their broader ESG integration strategy. The strong links between material ESG issues and the UN SDGs help investors understand the relevance of the goals to investment decisions and offer solutions for aligning investments with the world’s collective effort to end poverty, protect the planet, and improve the lives of everyone everywhere. As such, the UN SDGs have the potential to deliver value not only through impact investments, but also through wider ESG-focused strategies. Measuring UN SDG alignment While there is no consensus on a universal approach to report on UN SDG alignment, it is increasingly recognised that companies can contribute or detract from the UN SDGs through not only their products and services, but also through their operations. The measurement challenge Source: BlackRock Sustainable Investing as of 31 May 2021. Measures of holistic alignment equip investors with useful information on their exposure to SDG-related themes and gives them the ability to differentiate amongst investments which are more exposed to future risks and opportunities. Integrating the UN SDGs in investments While measuring the alignment of investments to the UN SDGs is still a complex and evolving task, our research shows that their integration in investment decisions can help secure long-term financial performance and is relevant to all sustainable investors. Impact and thematic investing We believe that the UN SDGs have the potential to deliver value to not only impact investments, but also wider ESG-focused strategies that can benefit from the historic opportunity to accelerate the global transition towards the goals. An example of a theme relevant to the UN SDGs is the Circular Economy. The circular economy encapsulates the global shift from a linear take-make-use-waste economy to one in which goods are recycled, shared, re-used and/or used for longer to design waste out of the system. It thus provides alignment with targets linked to UN SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production. Source: BlackRock Sustainable Investing as of 31 May 2021. Sustainable objective On top of thematic exposure, UN SDGs can also translate into a sustainable objective based on both assessment of product and services alignment and adding operational alignment using ESG key performance indicators that are relevant to the goals. This involves setting a threshold of aggregated UN SDG alignment from a revenue perspective and an operational alignment perspective. At BlackRock, we provide our investment teams with tools to integrate the UN SDGs in their solutions and prioritise engagements to help enhance corporate disclosures and awareness on the topics that matter most both for companies’ long-term financial prospects and for the goal achievement. \"},\n",

       "  'content': ' Overview Our research shows that impact investing in public equities can help accomplish two crucial investment objectives: generate financial outperformance and provide a differentiated source of alpha versus global equities. Inspired by the foundational framework in Grinold and Kahn’s “Fundamental Law of Active Management,”1 we extend the concept of breadth to analyze the opportunity for alpha in impact investing in public equities. We also illustrate how impact investments can work to enhance a whole portfolio’s structure by improving diversification, increasing the potential for financial performance while mitigating risk. What is the impact universe? The impact universe is made up of companies whose core products or services help solve the world’s great social and environmental challenges. Consisting of approximately 600 publicly traded companies as of March 31, 2020, the universe has been built by BlackRock based on proprietary, fundamental research. To qualify for the universe, companies must meet the criteria of “materiality” and “additionality.” The materiality requirement insists that greater than 50% of a company’s revenues or business activity must come from products or services helping to solve major social or environmental problems (such as those represented by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets2). Additionality requires that a company’s products or services must address a need that is unlikely to be fulfilled by others (such as competitors or governments). Applying the concept of “breadth” Differentiated market inefficiencies in public equities impact investing reflect breadth and the potential opportunity for capturing alpha. Impact companies have higher standard deviation of returns versus global equities, leading to a wider set of risks and opportunities that can be exploited in seeking to generate alpha. Impact companies demonstrate a higher and more frequent dispersion of returns versus global equities, representing another market inefficiency (see chart below). Next, impact companies have lower coverage by sell-side analysts, which we see as an opportunity.3 Notably, the impact opportunity set has low overlap in names with major indices, adding to breadth and the opportunity to generate alpha.4 Finally, impact companies cannot be systematically identified5, and therefore are often misclassified or misunderstood, offering significant opportunity.

Complementary roles in a portfolio asset allocation structure Impact investing in public equities has characteristics that can serve important roles in a portfolio’s strategic asset allocation structure. Investing in impact companies provides exposure to structural growth. Additionally, with lower valuations across standard equity metrics such as Price/Earnings, Price/Cash Flow, and more, many companies in our impact universe are less expensive than global equities.6 As previously noted, because impact companies are (i) more neglected by analysts, (ii) have low overlap in names compared to traditional equity indices, (iii) are often misclassified by industry frameworks, (iv) cannot be identified by systematic screening and (v) have business models that can be driven by megatrends, impact companies can offer exposure to these segments of the market and enhance portfolio diversification. In a portfolio that already has private market impact investments, public equities impact investing provides exposure to companies that are typically at a different stage of growth in their business lifecycle as they scale their business models. Finally, impact investing in public equities serves as a complement to other sustainability vehicles. '},\n",

       "  'content': ' Context, opportunities and priorities in emerging markets In confronting the challenges to mitigate global climate change, there is a fundamental mismatch persisting today, between where that investment needs to occur – in emerging, high growth markets with lower renewable energy penetration – and where the capital currently resides – in developed, low growth markets, where the energy transition is more advanced. For private investors, there are several key questions to answer. Where do we see the leading fundamentals and most attractive opportunities in these newer renewable energy markets? How do we go about investing in these locations? How can capital structuring potentially affect our assessment of risk-adjusted returns? Where investment is most needed There is a fundamental mismatch in the global energy transition today, as the world addresses climate change by shifting from fossil fuels to renewables, as part of a broadening commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We see most of the world’s population growth, economic activity and carbon emissions outside of the world’s wealthiest economies. Renewable energy investments are lagging in these markets, partly due to insufficient private capital. Economic costs of climate change are concentrated in emerging markets Source: Economist Intelligence Unit. Figures represent average real GDP loss by 2050. Data as at 30 November 2019.There is no guarantee that any forecasts and forward-looking expectations made will come to pass. Where there is most impact These developing regions are facing firming economic growth and surging power demand. At the same time, these same regions are bearing a heavy burden from climate change, with rising sea levels, climate variability and intensifying drought and heat stress. Renewables investments can bring positive change to these markets, by providing cleaner energy, better job opportunities, sustainable communities, whilst addressing global climate change, but we need to start now. Taking renewables to the new world In our view, there are compelling opportunities, across Asia, Latin America and Africa, reflecting the strong growth outlook for energy demand, supportive policy and regulatory frameworks and better risk-mitigation strategies for private investors. The right public-private partnership may be the key to unlock these renewable energy markets, by delivering both development finance capital (with its greater equity risk appetite) and private capital (with its traditional focus on risk-adjusted returns).

       "  'abstract': 'Read an overview of the different approaches available to transition an equity portfolio to net zero alignment, focusing on carbon intensity and risk factors.',\n",
       "  'content': \" Portfolio pathways to net zero A global net zero commitment establishes an aggregate timeline for achieving the well below 2°C target called for in the Paris Agreement. Many country and corporate net zero commitments target 2050, consistent with global targets to avoid catastrophic outcomes from climate change. The global momentum toward net zero means that there will be a dramatic reshaping of the economy over the next few decades. As investors look to mitigate the risks associate with climate change and lean into the opportunity set around the transition to a net zero economy, there are several options in terms of portfolio construction. Spectrum of sustainable strategies Within investing approaches to the climate transition and the pathway to net zero, there are a variety of risk mitigation and investment opportunities to consider. We feel a useful framework for thinking this is from the standpoint of “Reduce, Prioritize, Target”. Reduce: Significantly lower exposure to fossil fuel exploration, reserves, and in general a portfolio with a lower carbon profile. This mitigates risks likely caused by stranded assets re-pricing, increased regulation and costs, and changing consumer preferences. Prioritize: Focusing on climate transition or physical risk reduction by incorporating forward looking data. This can help both mitigate risks and capturing opportunities by investing in companies/countries better positioned to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy. Target: Target climate focused thematic exposures or impact objectives. This approach captures opportunities from disruptive technologies and discerns between new winners and losers, supporting and financing the low carbon transition. Depending on the time horizon for transitioning a portfolio to net zero, as well as the underlying exposures and risk/return parameters, some combination of the approaches can be used to target the optimal carbon reduction while adhering to a portfolio’s broader return targets. New dimensions in portfolio design As investors are incorporating various sustainable investments within their portfolios, BlackRock has helped clients evaluate different strategies to help achieve the desired outcomes. One framework is through the development of a carbon intensity efficient frontier. Portfolios constructed along this frontier minimizes carbon intensity per unit of tracking error or active risk. For example, the carbon reduction option in the below chart represents an illustrative portfolio that helps reduce carbon intensity by 60% with under 100bps of tracking error. From an information ratio perspective, this option also improves the overall risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio.

Detailed analytics complementing sustainable solutions Combined with the carbon intensity efficient frontier, BlackRock can leverage the Aladdin platform to analyze portfolios with great granularity. This can help investors better understand active risk exposures and ensure the portfolios are positioned appropriately to target the desired outcome. Based on the previous example, we can analyze the carbon reduction option’s active risk is primarily driven by orthogonal, idiosyncratic risks and there are no meaningful style factor tilts. As investors embark on their path to net zero, it’s imperative to utilize all resources and tools available to analyze the overall portfolio impact from various perspectives.

       "  'content': \" Evaluating ESG We believe that sustainability risk and climate risk are investment risks, and that integrating sustainability can help investors build resilient portfolios and help achieve long-term objectives. That is why we are incorporating sustainability into our portfolio design, as part of a series of actions BlackRock is taking to support the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner. Despite the common belief that one must give up returns with sustainable investments, our analysis saw reallocations to such strategies improved ESG profiles, while maintaining the overall risk-adjusted return profile of the overall portfolio. Climate risk is investment risk The commonly held notion that tackling climate change must come at a cost to the global economy is wrong, in our view. If no action is taken to combat climate change, its projected effects would imply a lower path of economic growth. Our capital market assumptions (CMAs) reflect our view that an orderly transition to a low carbon economy, consistent with the Paris Agreement goals, will deliver an improved outlook for growth and risk assets relative to doing nothing. We see climate change and the green transition as persistent drivers of asset returns, and consequently fundamental to making strategic investment decisions. Climate change and policies to combat it flow through our CMAs via three main channels: the macroeconomic impact, the repricing of assets to reflect climate risks and exposures and the impact on corporate fundamentals.

From the analysis, reallocating to sustainable investments preserves the expected return for the average pension portfolio, with slight reduction in risk based on our forward-looking CMAs. From a historical performance perspective, reallocating to sustainable investments may also improve its risk-adjusted return profile.

       "  'content': ' Investing is undergoing a long-term transformation toward sustainability. \"Climate risk and transition risk are going to impact every portfolio across the board,\" said BlackRock\\'s Chairman and CEO Larry Fink, speaking with Bill Gates at BlackRock’s recent Future Forum event Sustainability: The path to net zero. \"It\\'s become clear to me that this is going to be a sea change.\" We believe these factors, taken together, create an inexorable, generational and self-perpetuating shift in favor of sustainable investments. We are convinced that this trend will raise the relative prices and valuations of assets with stronger sustainability characteristics, and that investors who act now to position themselves for this change are likely to benefit in the years to come. Three forces shaping the new paradigm 1. Recognition of the enormity of climate change Around the world, people in every sphere—citizens, consumers, policymakers, corporate decision-makers, investors and more—have begun to realize the urgent need to address climate change. Indeed, the mounting costs of extreme weather events have become impossible to ignore. Extreme weather events have increased drastically in the last decade, leading to higher costs Source: Munich RE, Record hurricane season and major wildfires – The natural disaster figures for 2020, as of January 7, 2021. Investors are taking note: 88% of investors polled by BlackRock’s Global Sustainable Investing Survey ranked the environment as the top priority among ESG factors.1 The rising focus on climate change is already disrupting industries. Consider automobiles: General Motors has pledged to electrify all its light-duty vehicles by 2035 and be carbon-neutral by 2040.2 The need to act on climate change “caused us to start in earnest developing the platform…to provide an electric vehicle for everyone,” said GM CEO Mary Barra, speaking at BlackRock’s Future Forum on Sustainability. As legacy companies adapt, opportunities open for innovation. “What we\\'re witnessing is perhaps one of the most interesting transitions we\\'re going to see for a long while,” said RJ Scaringe, founder of electric truck and SUV maker Rivian, another speaker at the BlackRock Future Forum. “A massive, massive industry – everything from the fuel supply, to the supply chain around the components in a vehicle, to production of those vehicles, to how those vehicles are distributed, to how they\\'re serviced, to how they\\'re operated – all of that is going to change, and change in a meaningful way over the next 10 years.” 2. Reallocation of capital toward sustainable companies New global flows into sustainable funds increased from US$30 billion in 2016 to US$360 billion in 2020, rising every year.3 This trend is just beginning. Institutional investors worldwide representing US$25 trillion in assets expect to double their sustainable assets under management over the next five years.4 Institutions to double sustainable investments by 2025 Allocations to sustainable assets Source: BlackRock 2020 Global Sustainable Investing Survey, as of December 3, 2020. We believe this shift will accelerate as more investors price the impacts of sustainability into their assumptions. Rising asset flows are likely to boost the asset prices and valuations of more-sustainable investments, benefiting the investors who hold them. \"We\\'re in the very early stages of this journey,” said Fink, noting that he expects it to last decades. Some investors remain hesitant: BlackRock’s Global Sustainable Investing Survey showed that nearly a third of investors believe there are insufficient products available to meet their sustainability objectives.5 Innovation in the investment industry is likely to dispel concerns long-term. Sustainable investment options now encompass virtually every asset class, from green bonds to renewable infrastructure to targeted thematic climate strategies. Investors’ options continue to expand rapidly. For example, sustainable investments are the fastest-growing type of exchange-traded fund (ETF).6 Given the ease of market access ETFs may offer, the growth of sustainable ETFs could facilitate climate-aware investing for many more investors—especially considering institutions’ stated intention to increase allocations to sustainable assets. Historically, a lack of robust data measuring environmental, social and governance factors has been a barrier for many investors. In the BlackRock 2020 Global Sustainable Investing Survey, more than half (53%) of institutional investors cite lack of high-quality ESG data and analytics as the biggest obstacle to implementing sustainable investing.7 But the quality and quantity of sustainability data are increasing rapidly. Nine out of 10 S&P 500 companies reported ESG metrics in 2019, up from two in 10 in 2011.8 As companies provide greater transparency and disclosure, says Fink, \"We will be more equipped to judge how they\\'re trying to move their business in terms of the transition to net zero.\" As a result, more investors will be comfortable embracing the shift to sustainable investments. 3. Data linking sustainable investing to alpha A growing body of data now show that sustainable investments produce risk-adjusted returns at least on par with less-sustainable investments.9 Consider this: A historical back-test of ESG-focused equity benchmarks showed better annualized returns than their conventional parent indices between 2012 and 2020.10 Comparison of historical annualized returns of traditional equity benchmarks and back-tested annualized returns of ESG-focused equity benchmarks, 2012-2020 (by region) Source: Blackrock Sustainable Investing, as of August 2020. Notes: The data cover December 3, 2012 to August 31, 2020. Returns are annualized gross returns in U.S. dollar terms of the US indices and annualized net returns for the EAFE and EM indices. Indexes used are the MSCI USA Index, MSCI EAFE, MSCI EM Index (*Traditional columns) and MSCI’s ESG-focused derivations of each (MSCI USA ESG Focus Index, MSCI EAFE ESG Focus Index and MSCI Emerging Markets ESG Focus Index). The data shown prior to inceptions for each MSCI ESG Focus Index (August 2016 for U.S.; April 2019 for EAFE; April 2016 for EM) are back tested by MSCI. They are optimized to maximize ESG exposure within constraints (example: a tracking error of 50 basis points and maximum active weight of 2% for each index constituent for USA ESG Focus). Back tested performance is hypothetical, simulated and is not indicative of actual future returns. Back tested performance is developed within the benefit of hindsight, has inherent limitations and invariably shows positive rates of return. ESG scores shown are average scores for each index based on MSCI data. See important notes on the next slide. Furthermore, investing for sustainability especially seems to boost resilience during times of market turmoil. Take the first quarter of 2020, when COVID-19 threw markets into upheaval: Funds in the top 10% on sustainability measures delivered performance in the top half of their peer group, on average.11 By contrast, funds in the bottom 10% on sustainability had average performance near the bottom of their groups.12 These results were consistent across asset classes.13 Average peer group performance ranking, Q1 2020 Comparing funds with highest and lowest sustainability rankings within peer group Source: BlackRock Sustainable Investing as of December 31, 2020, Morningstar as of May 11, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. See “Average peer group performance ranking” for more detail. Peer comparison shown is for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to compare all funds in the same investment universe nor does it compare all characteristics of the funds. Likewise, indices of sustainable investments held up better than conventional indices during other challenging markets in recent years.14 Percentage of sustainable indices that have outperformed during downturns Source: BlackRock Sustainable Investing as of December 31, 2020, Morningstar as of May 11, 2020.

For important detail, see: https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/investor-education/sustainable-investing-resilience.pdf These data suggest that investing in more-sustainable assets and companies has the potential to enhance risk-adjusted performance over the long term, paving the way for wider adoption among investors. That outcome is consistent with BlackRock’s 2020 Global Sustainable Investing Survey, which found that two of the top three reasons institutions engage in sustainable investment activities relate to risk and performance.15 Top reasons institutions employ sustainable investing: To achieve closer alignment to investment objectives and/or organizational mission To seek improved risk-adjusted performance To mitigate investment risk We believe the confluence of these factors will force a supportive repricing of all assets, and we have incorporated that expectation into our capital market assumptions. Climate change will affect macroeconomic variables such as economic growth and weather impacts, leading investors to adjust the risk premia they apply to different assets.16 Differences in asset flows between more- and less-sustainable investments will drive premium pricing for the former.17 Companies that position themselves for sustainability will reap revenue, brand and risk-mitigation benefits that result in stronger fundamentals, justifying premium valuations.18 Framework for climate-aware portfolios Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, as of February 2021. Climate-aware capital market assumptions incorporate the impacts of climate change on macroeconomic variables and asset class returns, in addition to traditional return drivers. The shift toward sustainability is in its early stages, so markets do not yet fully reflect its long-term implications. This dynamic is typical of large, decades-long trends: For example, the markets took decades to price in the market and economic implications of the Baby Boom generation. Over time, we believe the markets will grant more-sustainable assets a return and valuation premium. Estimated 5-year expected return differential for MSCI U.S. sectors in green transition vs no-climate-action, Feb 2021 Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream and Bloomberg, February 2021. Notes: The chart shows the difference in five-year U.S. dollar expected returns for the highest sub-category of MSCI USA sectors under two economic scenarios – a green transition and a no-climate-action scenario. The difference in expected return is attributable to repricing – the return impact of changing cost of capital – and fundamentals – or the return impact of changing earnings per share growth. This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise – or even estimate – of future performance. Actions for institutional investors In our view, the economic benefits of mitigating the impact of climate change can outweigh the economic costs of doing so. We believe that avoiding climate-related damages will help prevent economic degradation and improve the returns of risk assets. And we expect the markets to reward companies, sectors and countries that adjust to the post-carbon transition and to penalize those that don\\'t. Many investors appear to agree and are already changing tack. \"More and more investors are asking: How should we be prepared?\" said Fink. \"We\\'re seeing tens of billions of dollars moving away from traditional investment strategies to sustainable strategies.” We urge investors to take environmental, social and governance factors into account as part of a holistic portfolio construction process: Ensuring that ESG considerations around risk and return are integrated across your portfolio Where appropriate, exploring dedicated sustainable strategies that offer both a financial objective and a specified sustainable outcome, whether broad, thematic or impact in nature We firmly believe that investors who effectively incorporate these factors are likely to outperform in the new sustainable investing paradigm.

       "  'content': ' Overview To holistically support an impact enterprise’s enduring success, we believe impact investing in public equities should be built on three interconnected pillars: additionality through the investor’s contribution; additionality through the investee (the company); and additionality through the asset class. Definition of impact investing Impact investments are investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return. The practice of impact investing is further defined by core characteristics: intentionality; use of evidence and impact data in investment design; management of impact performance; contribution to the growth of the industry. Contribution from the investor Impact investors, with their natural long-term horizon, can afford an impact company the benefit of focusing on its long-term goals. Additionally, impact investors offer a more responsible exit from private investment for impact companies through patient capital and a long-term partnership. Furthermore, investors can create impact by participating in capital raises which provide additionality to the impact company. Finally, investors can engage with companies on impact progress, and increase attention to often overlooked impact enterprises. Contribution from the company A business qualifies as impact only if it meets the criteria of materiality and additionality. We typically define materiality as having greater than 50% of a company’s revenues from products and services helping to solve a major social or environmental problem. To meet the additionality criterion, a company’s products or services must address a need that is unlikely to be fulfilled by others (such as competitors or governments). Contribution at the asset class level Quite simply, the global need for impact capital is an order of magnitude greater than what could conceivably be provided by the private markets. For developing markets alone, we face a shortfall of approximately US$2.5 trillion annually to meet the SDGs by 2030.1 Given the magnitude of the need and the extraordinary opportunity, we must find ways for public markets to scale impact investing with integrity. By offering impact investing through public equities, a broad new cohort of investors can participate and provide much needed capital. '},\n",

While ESG itself is not a factor, the frontier of factor research is to incorporate ESG data into the factor definitions themselves. For example, we have used machine learning techniques to quantify corporate culture as part of our quality measures. Alpha Alpha is about seeking idiosyncratic returns that are independent of index and factor exposures. This typically involves targeting unique and harder to access insights – including those related to ESG.

We do this through both systematic and fundamental approaches. '},\n",

       "  'content': \" Sustainable investing is reaching an inflection point for family offices. Four out of five family offices are engaged in some form of sustainable investing, according to BlackRock's recent Global Family Office Survey. This figure represents tremendous growth over the past several years, during which time family offices have moved from learning about sustainable investing to actively incorporating it. They are embracing two strategies in particular: climate strategies and impact strategies. Climate strategies focus on avoiding climate related risks and investing in companies positioned to capture opportunities related to the transition to a net zero economy. Impact strategies have the dual objective of delivering financial returns and creating measurable positive environmental or social outcomes. As part of a recent webcast series in partnership with BDO United States, Alexandra Hirsch, a Director on the BlackRock Sustainable Investing team, spoke about these strategies with Jessica Huang, Head of Sustainable Investment Solutions for Americas and Japan. Following is a summary of their conversation. Why is climate change such an area of interest for family offices? Climate change is becoming impossible for investors to ignore. The U.S. alone in 2020 had 22 climate-related weather disaster events that exceeded USD$1billion of damages.1 So, individuals are starting to see the effects of climate change in their day-to-day lives. Meanwhile, 127 governments from the U.S. to China are moving toward net-zero economies, meaning they will balance emissions produced with emissions removed from the atmosphere. And combatting climate change is a primary concern not just for governments but for private companies: Over 1,100 companies have committed to or are considering net-zero targets. The transition to net zero presents an amazing opportunity for investors to reallocate capital to companies and sectors that are poised to benefit. We don't believe that the markets are fully pricing in information about sustainability. We have updated our capital market assumptions to fully incorporate climate considerations, which will allow us to more accurately estimate the long-term prices of assets and better position our clients' portfolios. At BlackRock, we're also developing a heightened scrutiny model across our active investment portfolios to look at our environmental, social and governance (ESG) integration efforts, and we're embedding climate into our broader sustainability platform. All new sustainable strategies will include a climate objective like reduced carbon emissions intensity or increased exposure to companies capturing climate-related opportunities. We're also building innovative new investment solutions that are aligned with the specific temperature goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. What part of impact investing is of most interest to family offices? What is ESG versus impact investing? One of the best explanations is that ESG is what happens within the walls of a company, and impact is what happens outside the walls of a company. At BlackRock, we offer ESG strategies that invest in companies that perform better on operational issues related to environmental, social and governance. And we also offer impact strategies that are designed with the intention to generate positive, measurable social or environmental impact alongside financial returns. With family office clients, we're seeing a lot of interest in impact investing with regard to both climate and social issues. On the climate side, the focus is very much on renewable energy. At BlackRock, we're already one of the world's largest investors in renewables, but historically our platform has focused on OECD countries. As we think about the global transition to a net zero economy, we also need to support emerging markets. So, we've partnered with the governments of France and Germany as well as a multitude of foundations to create an innovative, blended finance solution that will invest in renewable energy infrastructure across emerging markets. On the social side, we're seeing particular interest in racial and diversity issues. The events of the past summer increased interest in investing to address the racial equity gap in America. There weren't that many strategies that focused on this issue, so we decided to develop an impact strategy that provides funding for minority-owned businesses and communities that historically have been undercapitalized. Are sustainable strategies delivering returns commensurate with traditional strategies? This is a question we get all the time. Looking back ten-plus years ago, most investors in sustainable products were thinking mainly about moral and ethical considerations, which meant they avoided or screened certain issuers or industries. The space has evolved so much. Now sustainable strategies are focusing on using environmental, social and governance data to identify better-run companies—companies that are addressing the needs of all their stakeholders and also thinking about their environmental footprint. And so, when you look at the analysis coming out of the industry more recently, most most of it is showing that there's no difference in performance between sustainable and traditional strategies. In fact, sometimes there's actually an edge for sustainable strategies. During the first quarter of last year, when the Dow Jones dropped about 10,000 points, 94 percent of sustainable indices outperformed their parent benchmark. And over 80 percent of them maintained that outperformance throughout 2020.4 Beyond that, we've found that ESG funds generally provide downside risk protection over even longer periods, such as three, five or ten years. At BlackRock, we design impact strategies that meet the same bar of competitive market rate returns, in addition to contributing to measurable positive environmental or social outcomes. The reason we're able to do this is because our impact companies actually had twice the sales growth of the companies in the broader global equity universe. That's because these are companies that are solving the world's greatest problems, issues such as affordable housing, health care, education, and financial inclusion, and so they're exposed to huge structural growth tailwinds. What is the future of sustainable investing? There are two main takeaways: Sustainable investing is on the rise There’s a lot of room for innovation The first is that we're seeing real dollar flows. In 2020, we saw USD$280 billion move into sustainable ETFs and mutual funds globally.2 But we're still in the early stages of sustainable investing. In a recent survey, of 425 investors around the globe, representing USD$25 trillion of assets, said they expect to double their sustainable allocations over the next five years. And this trend was echoed in our family office survey, which found that 75 percent of family offices expect to increase their exposure to sustainable strategies in the coming year. The second takeaway is that there's a lot of room for innovation when it comes to sustainable strategies. As we get better data and better technology, as we get smarter about measuring environmental and social issues, we're going to be able to develop more advanced solutions. At BlackRock, we're trying hard to keep up with client demand. In 2020, our platform doubled in assets under management, and we almost doubled the number of strategies on our sustainable platform.3 As we look toward 2021 and beyond, we're going to continue to innovate in that space. \"},\n",

Avoiding damages from climate change The popular notion that tackling climate change comes at a net cost to the global economy is wrong, we believe. Avoiding climate-related damages will help prevent economic deterioration and improve risk-asset returns, in our view. We see the “green” transition to a carbon-neutral world rewarding companies, sectors and countries that adjust and penalizing others. That is why our capital market assumptions (CMAs) – long-run estimates of risk and return – now reflect the impact of climate change. Estimates in this area are highly uncertain, yet our framework is designed to account for this. We will refine this framework as we monitor the evolution of the “green” transition. We focus on climate because we believe a broad consensus around its impact and measurement suggests that climate change is fast becoming a key driver of asset pricing. Our updated CMAs are driven by sectoral views, with exposure to climate risks and opportunities a key determinant. We see technology and healthcare benefiting the most from that perspective, and carbon-intensive sectors such as energy and utilities lagging. This in turn increases our strategic preference for developed market (DM) equities, at the expense of high yield and some emerging market (EM) debt. Why? The composition of DM equity indexes better aligns with the climate transition, with large weights of technology and healthcare companies, less vulnerability to transition risks and lower carbon intensity. Equities also can better capture potential opportunities of the green transition, as bonds are capped in their capital appreciation. Sectors that face structural challenges due to rising climate awareness, such as energy and utilities, are more prevalent in high yield and EM debt indexes. Download full PDF report The green transition The two scenarios to compare from this perspective: a transition to a low- carbon economy in which policies to fight climate change are enacted, and a no-climate-action scenario with no actions to limit damages. A commonly held notion is that tackling climate change has to come at an economic cost. We think that’s wrong. We assume the global economy transitions to a lower carbon path consistent with Paris Agreement goals. The positive effect of this transition rests on a gradual phasing in of carbon taxes, green infrastructure spending consistent with the IMF’s recommendation, and subsidies on renewable energy. If none of these actions are taken to mitigate climate change, we estimate a cumulative loss in global output of nearly 25% in the next two decades. The stylized Accounting for climate change chart illustrates the potential difference between the two paths. We focus on the \"E\" (environmental) of ESG in our updated CMAs. Why? First, there is wide recognition of the importance of climate change on economic and social outcomes. Second, there is consensus on the measurement of an entity’s contribution to climate change: carbon emissions. Carbon emissions have become a widely enough adopted indicator of sustainability for investors to be a driver of repricing at the broad market level. We see insights into S (social) and G (governance) as key sources of potential returns through security selection, rather than as systematic drivers of returns. We will consider incorporating them in our framework once consensus around their impact and availability of consistent data improve in coming years. Getting into the macro We believe macro variables will be different in a world that is transitioning to a sustainable future. Such changes mean sustainability affects everything that goes into forming a view on long-term asset class returns. We see changes in so-called risk premia for all asset classes – the compensation investors require for holding them. Repricing effects The price investors are willing to pay for sustainable assets is changing. The BlackRock 2020 Global Sustainability Survey of September 2020 found 425 institutional investors planned to double their sustainable assets under management in the next five years to 37%. We see this as a tectonic shift toward sustainable assets. Changing investor preferences will spur a climate change-led repricing due to the falling cost of capital for sustainable assets. These assets will generate higher returns than traditional peers as a result, in our view. Investors are just starting to respond to the structural shift, suggesting it is not yet in the price. Once this repricing phase has passed, we believe this channel will eventually no longer be a boon for “greener” assets’ expected returns. Back to the fundamentals Climate change and policies to mitigate it will affect profitability across sectors, we believe. This will have knock-on effects on other variables such as credit default and downgrade assumptions. No one knows yet what a low-carbon world will look like. Climate projections are highly uncertain. This is due to the complexity of modeling the dynamics and myriad dependencies between climate and carbon emissions, economic variables and mitigation policies. Our framework allows us to systematically monitor key metrics and the evolution of the green transition, and we plan to adapt it accordingly. Our approach explicitly accounts for uncertainty - highly relevant for climate change that will have varying but highly uncertain impacts over time. We believe this approach lends itself well to the structural transformation taking place. '},\n",

       "  'content': \" Most ignore the effects of climate change in their financial projections. We believe this is not right. Climate change is real and cannot be ignored by investors. Climate risk is investment risk, and we see it is as a historic investment opportunity. Our capital market assumptions (CMAs) – a core input to building portfolios – for the first time, explicitly reflect the impact of climate change on the investment landscape. This is one of a set of actions we are taking to prepare investors for the global transition to a net zero emissions economy by 2050 or sooner. Pioneering research The commonly held notion that tackling climate change has to come at a net cost to the global economy is wrong, in our view. If no action is taken to combat climate change, the considerable physical damages would imply a lower path of economic growth. Our CMAs reflect our view that the green transition to a low-carbon economy, consistent with the Paris Agreement goals, will deliver an improved outlook for growth and risk assets relative to doing nothing. The chart below shows our estimates of the impact on China – an increasingly important pillar of the global economy and one where the impact of climate change is likely to be significant. Seeing green Estimated GDP paths scenario for China, 2020-40 Forward looking estimates may not come to pass. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, Banque de France, International Energy Agency, OECD, January 2021. Notes: The chart shows our estimated path for China’s GDP over the next 20 years under the two mentioned scenarios. GDP levels are rebased to 100 as of 2020. Underpinning the climate-aware CMAs is our view of an orderly transition that successfully limits climate-related damage. The tectonic shift toward sustainability has gathered momentum over the past year following a series of major climate change commitments by corporations, governments and investors alike, bolstering our conviction in an orderly transition to a low-carbon world. Investors are just starting to respond to the structural shift – suggesting it is not yet fully in the price of assets. The BlackRock 2020 Global Sustainability Survey found that respondents plan to double their sustainable assets under management (AUM) in the next five years – rising from 18% of AUM on average today to 37% on average by 2025. We see climate change and the green transition as persistent drivers of asset returns, and consequently fundamental to making strategic investment decisions. Climate change and policies to combat it flow through our CMAs via three main channels: the macroeconomic impact, the repricing of assets to reflect climate risks and exposures and the impact on corporate fundamentals. A historic investment opportunity Climate change and efforts to curb it will have major economic outcomes, not just far into the future but in the next few decades (Dietz et al., 2020). We have updated the long-term macroeconomic framework that underpins our CMAs. Such an outlook rejects the commonly held notion that tackling climate change has to come at a net cost to society. Globally, we estimate a cumulative loss in economic output of nearly 25% over the next two decades due to the level of GDP being 2.3% lower in 20 years’ time if no climate change mitigation measures were taken. The chart below shows the potential cumulative impact of three factors – avoidance of climate damage, transition costs, and green infrastructure spending – on GDP by 2040. China’s green opportunity Estimated cumulative impact as a percentage of GDP scenario for China, 2020-40 Forward looking estimates may not come to pass. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, Banque de France, International Energy Agency, OECD, January 2021. Notes: The chart shows the cumulative impact on long-term GDP under a green transition relative to a no-climate-action scenario. The bars show the overall estimated impact of three factors – avoidance of climate damages (positive), green infrastructure spending (positive) and costs associated with the transition (negative). The black line shows the estimated net impact. Our estimates of the impact under a climate-aware scenario are based on expected changes in energy consumption including composition, relative carbon and renewables pricing and on potential losses due to global warming. Energy consumption is estimated as a function of GDP and the relative price of energy per the Banque de France's working paper no. 759 titled the Long-term growth impact of climate change and policies. GDP losses from global warming are calibrated on analysis of Impact Assessment Models per W. Nordhaus and A..Moffat (2017). We assume green infrastructure spending programs of 1% of GDP gradually phased out over the next 10 years. Getting into the macro We first incorporate climate damages into our economic projections. The economic losses, associated with rising temperatures, build over time and are more pronounced in some regions than others (Burke et al., 2015). Call this the “no-climate-action” scenario – climate damages occur, but no action is taken to combat it. We then consider a second economic scenario, with policies and innovations that could mitigate climate damages – call this the “green transition” scenario. Specifically, in the green transition we consider the actions needed to ensure the Paris Agreement target of limiting temperature rises to below 2 degrees Celsius is achieved. The green transition is our base case for our updated CMAs and strategic asset class preferences. Economic loss due to climate damages can be largely avoided, in our view, by proactive climate policy action that keeps the global temperature change within the margins of the Paris Agreement through a combination of gradually rising carbon taxes and clean energy subsidies (Burke et al., 2018). We acknowledge the risks to the downside in our green transition scenario. Delays in implementing climate policies could result in a “disorderly transition”. Policy execution will be key: any shortfalls could undermine the policy predictability and credibility, making the energy transition more costly. The “E” in ESG There is wide recognition of the importance of climate change for economic and social outcomes and second, there is consensus on the measurement of an entity’s contribution to climate change - via carbon emissions. Carbon emissions are a widely enough adopted indicator of sustainability for investors to the extent that it can be a driver of repricing at the broad market level. We see insights into S (social) and G (governance) issues as potential sources of alpha impacting security selection, rather than as systematic drivers of returns and so exclude them from our CMAs. Macro variables such as GDP would be different in a world that is transitioning to a low carbon future, meaning traditional risk premia for all asset classes will change. The chart below shows our updated CMAs for selected asset class – the green dots show the mean expected returns in our base case of a green transition and the red dots indicate the expected returns in a no-climate-action scenario. For U.S. equities, our expected returns in a no-climate-action scenario would fall outside the band of uncertainty around our mean estimate, highlighting the potentially large impact from climate change. A meaningful impact BlackRock capital market assumptions for selected assets, February 2021 This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance.

There are two sets of bands around our mean return expectation. The darker bands show our estimates of uncertainty in our mean return estimates. The lighter bands are based on the 25th and 75th percentile of expected return outcomes – the interquartile range for more detail read Portfolio perspectives. Beyond the carbon cost In addition to the macro impact, we see the effects playing out through two more channels: Repricing: One consequence of shifting societal preferences is that the price investors are willing to pay for assets perceived to be sustainable is changing, driving differentiated returns. Capital flows toward sustainable assets are a symptom of this phenomenon. Our CMAs now directly reflect our estimates of such a premium. Fundamentals: This channel could be seen as an extension of the macro one. Some companies and sectors are better positioned than others for a transition to a low carbon economy. Corporate behavior will likely respond by adapting to policy and regulatory changes brought about to combat climate change. Profitability across sectors will be impacted. There will be sectoral winners and losers – underpinning why we believe a sectoral approach to sustainable investing is additive to a regional one. The chart below shows the estimated return impact across sectors from both the repricing and fundamental channels. We estimate a 7% annualized return differential over five years between the energy and technology sectors – a significant difference in a world of low expected returns across asset classes. Total return impact Estimated 5-year expected return differential for U.S. sectors in green transition vs, no action, February 2021 This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream and Bloomberg, February 2021. Notes: The chart shows the difference in five-year U.S. dollar expected returns for the highest sub-category of MSCI USA sectors under two economic scenarios - a green transition and a no-climate-action scenario. The difference in expected return is attributable to repricing – the return impact of changing cost of capital - and fundamentals – or the return impact of changing earnings per share growth. Uncertainty is a key element of our framework and is built into our CMAs. No one yet knows what a low-carbon world looks like. The transition may play out over several years, if not decades. We will monitor key trends such as capital flows, policy developments and technological advancements – and the way asset prices respond to them – and look to evolve our framework as new information becomes available. Our portfolio construction approach that explicitly accounts for uncertainty and provides a term structure of returns to capture the time varying impact of climate change lends itself well to the structural transformation we see playing out. Portfolio implications Tactical, or shorter-term, investment decisions will not be sufficient, in our view, to position for the fundamental reshaping of the global economy we see playing out. Positioning portfolios appropriately requires expressing views at the strategic asset level. Like any investment view, the ultimate implementation and sizing of climate change-led views in portfolios will vary depending on an investor’s risk appetite, objectives and eligible universe. Some investors may have to reallocate as much as 10-20% of existing assets. For others, it will be less. See our investor-specific asset allocation breakdowns for more. Our strategic asset preferences for a hypothetical unconstrained, U.S. dollar investor with a 10-year horizon are shown on the chart below and put our asset class views in a portfolio context. They reflect our views on all drivers of long-term asset returns, from the monetary and fiscal policy revolution to structural trends, such as the U.S.-China rivalry and the polarization of global growth. The impact of introducing climate change as an additional driver of returns on asset class views is shown on the right. Tilting toward sustainability Hypothetical U.S. dollar 10-year strategic allocation vs. our equilibrium view, February 2021 This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy or as a promise - or even estimate - of future performance. Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream and Bloomberg, February 2021. Notes: The chart shows our asset views on a 10-year view from an unconstrained US dollar perspective against a long-term equilibrium allocation described on our capital market assumptions website. The portfolio is illustrative and the allocation above does not represent any existing portfolio and, as such, is not an investible product. The construction of the hypothetical asset allocation is based on criteria applied with the benefit of hindsight and knowledge of factors that may have positively affected its performance and cannot account for risk factors that may affect the actual portfolio's performance. The actual performance may vary significantly from our modelled CMAs due to transaction costs, liquidity or other market factors. Indexes are unmanaged, do not account for management fees and one cannot invest directly in an index. See appendix for full list of index proxies. The most significant impact is a stronger preference for developed market equities at the expense of high yield and emerging market debt. The composition of developed market equity indices better aligns with the climate transition and equities have more ability to capture the upside opportunities from the climate transition. The higher carbon intensity of companies that typically make up high yield and emerging market debt benchmark indices detracts from their expected returns, diminishing their appeal within our overall preferred strategic allocation. Another impact of incorporating climate change in our CMAs - granular investing becomes more prominent in portfolio construction. We believe climate change will drive greater dispersion of returns at a sector level than at the asset class level. We see sectors as the relevant unit of investment analysis and if we allow sector granularity in our portfolio construction, buying assets at the sector level rather than at an index-based regional level, the impacts on strategic asset preferences can be material. We have a strategic preference for inflation–linked government bonds over nominal government bonds. We see the policy revolution driving higher inflation over the medium-term but don’t expect rising inflation expectations to be reflected through higher nominal yields as much as was historically the case. Yet we see a diminished ability of nominal bonds to act as ballast and expect high public debt levels to push yields higher over the strategic horizon. We are strategically underweight credit as we see valuations as expensive on a relative basis relative to equities. Our preference for a strategic overweight to Chinese assets overall is not diminished – and is, in fact, enhanced for Chinese government bonds given the relatively poorer outlook for comparable assets.

A Q&A with Sonia Rocher If environmental, social and governance issues were already on the radar of many private credit funds, their investors and portfolio companies, 2020 looks set to be the year that accelerates the integration of sustainable investment and business practices. But what does ESG integration mean in the context of private debt? And how much leverage does a lender really have with management teams when it comes to encouraging sustainability? We explored these and other issues with Sonia Rocher, managing director in BlackRock’s European private credit group. Why are ESG factors becoming more important for corporates seeking access to capital? We’ve seen a lot of change over the past few years as lenders and investors have been gathering data and monitoring borrowers through more of a sustainability lens. This development has been happening quite rapidly in private credit, but we’re also seeing it across the liquid credit markets, including in areas such as high-yield bonds and leveraged loans. Overall, there is a much greater awareness and understanding of how capital can be directed towards the sustainability agenda. For example, we take a long-term view on companies and why they will be winners – ESG and sustainability factors play strongly into this. As an investor, you want to be sure you are backing companies with a sustainable business model and that holds true across private credit, private equity, public equities and fixed income. That means companies increasingly need to demonstrate their ESG credentials and especially their readiness for climate transition to be successful in capital-raising.

       "  'content': \" Investors are increasingly making sustainable investing a fundamental part of their approach. Yet sustainable investment still remains a broad, and often vague, category. The search for clarity continues. The Systematic Active Equity (SAE) team's deep belief in ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues and the principles of sustainability that underlie them has led us to ask: Can we move beyond a compliance-only mindset to one that is more results-centric? Only in this way, we believe, can sustainable investing become truly sustainable. What’s in a number? For most of its recent history, sustainable and ESG investing has been characterized by a clamor for externally imposed standards. A host of third-party vendors has responded to this demand by providing ESG scores or ratings (See Sustainable investing: A ‘why not’ moment). We aren’t against scoring – to the contrary, a quantitative approach demands it. However, we also believe it is essential to take multiple issue areas into consideration when assessing sustainability, including indirect indicators of deep company attributes. Everything we consider must have an ability to tell us something about security performance, and not just a headline issue. Actively seeking solutions We took on the conceptual and measurement challenges in an effort to capture differences across companies. Our research set out to find more ambitious solutions with our goal in mind: to offer an approach to sustainability that is intentional and driven by results, rather than compliance alone.

       "  'content': ' The world is changing and so should our investment portfolios. Portfolio resilience has to go beyond government bonds and consider alternative return sources that can provide income and diversification. As the largest opportunity in private infrastructure, renewables are increasingly being asked to play that role in traditional portfolios. At the same time, rising investor allocations, increasing market participants and declining subsidies are changing the investment landscape. For investors today, navigating these ‘winds of change’ will be essential to get the most out of this resilient asset class. Download full report Navigating the winds of change We see three key investment themes: On the first theme, renewables markets are regionally moving through different cyclical phases and at different paces, reflecting local trends in demand, supply and policy. It is important to identify areas of relative value globally and avoid pockets of overheating. For example, Asia renewables today is reminiscent of Europe 10 years ago. South Korea is building 42 GW in wind and solar this decade alone according to Bloomberg – that’s equivalent to the UK’s entire installed base today. Balancing risk, reward and addressable opportunity Risk and return view of renewables market Source: BlackRock, proprietary analysis performed by the Global Renewable Power Team, June 2020. Capacity market data is taken from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Return is based on market data points and does not reflect investment strategy. We also believe that investing in renewables is not about avoiding risk altogether. It is about taking risks that are well understood and being equipped to manage those risks in order to generate best risk-adjusted performance. Construction and late-stage development risks are idiosyncratic and more directly manageable than long-term power price assumptions. At today’s competitive market for operating assets, we see material risk in more mature assets, as the return profile for operating assets is skewed to the downside Today, structural trends such as decarbonization and electrification are reshaping the energy industry and beyond. Investors should be equipped to position their investment approach and strategy in line with the market evolution. Being dynamic in portfolio positioning and embracing change are critical to getting the best out of the investment opportunity. Building portfolio resilience In our view, following these key investment themes, allows investors to get most of out the asset class and build up portfolio resilience through three key benefits of income, diversification and sustainability. Income: Investors are faced by fixed income yields that are at their lower bounds and equity dividends being cut or suspended. Income from renewables compares favourably to yields in other asset classes and has proven to be stable over time including during this pandemic. Diversification: Returns in renewable power projects are primarily driven by the availability of wind and solar resource, the capital costs to build new projects and the price of electricity. These idiosyncratic risks make renewables a natural portfolio diversifier and help reducing equity risk in an overall portfolio. Sustainability: Portfolio resilience is more than income and diversification. It’s making sure the portfolio is well positioned for structural themes. The shift toward sustainability is poised to give renewables a potential return advantage for years to come. Download full report Key Takeaways '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'What would the world look like with less water? We explore the often overlooked risk of water stress and its financial implications on portfolios. Take a look.',\n",
       "  'content': ' An understated risk The global pandemic has reinforced the importance of resilience in investment portfolios. This includes sustainability-related risks that investors may have been underappreciating, ranging from vulnerable global supply chains to health and safety issues. We believe increased asset flows into sustainable investing strategies in 2020 are part of a tectonic shift that could last decades. Physical risks posed by climate events – ranging from hurricanes to wildfires – have captured growing attention in the investment community. We zeroed in on these risks in Getting physical of April 2019, painting a granular picture of the financial implications across municipal bonds, commercial real estate and U.S. utility equities. In this piece, we extend our work on physical risks to water stress. What do we mean by water risk? One in four people globally live in regions at high risk of scarcity – with water demand exceeding supply – according to the World Resources Institute (WRI). This creates financial risks that investors today may not be pricing in. Examples include rising spending needs (to raise efficiency and meet tough regulations) and the cost of production disruptions (unavailability of water for agriculture or cooling power plants). Regulators are zeroing on such risks: A recent European Central Bank report included water stress among the physical climate risks it may require financial institutions to manage and disclose. Water: A scarce resource In past decades, the global demand for water has been increasing at a pace of 1% annually, according to the United Nations’ 2018 World Water Development Report, as growing urban populations strain resources. At the same time, climate change shifts the distribution of water supply by disrupting precipitation patterns. Higher water stress levels indicate greater competition among users. This increases the costs of sourcing, and forces conservation measures. Other factors behind this stress include lax environmental rules and pollution, which can reduce water quality and limit its potential use. Competition for waterEstimated water stress around the world by risk zone, 2030 Source: BlackRock Investment Institute and BlackRock Sustainable Investing, with data from WRI. Notes: WRI defines water stress as the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies. Higher water stress levels indicate more competition among water users. Water withdrawals include those from irrigation, livestock, industrial use, and domestic sectors. Available supplies capture natural runoff as well as the impact of upstream water use and dam operations on downstream water availability. Water stress is assessed on WRI’s five point scale, ranging from “low” to “extremely high” (1 to 5). The geographic variation in climate patterns and human demand for water, together with changes caused by rising global temperatures, result in great variation in the distribution of water stress around the world. The graphic above uses WRI projections that rank geographies’ water stress from “low” to “extremely high” as of 2030. India, the Middle East, northern and southern Africa, Australia, and the U.S. Southwest stand out as likely high risk zones within a decade of today. Key findings Water stress has financial implications. Companies with production facilities in stressed regions may face greater operating costs and insurance premiums. They will likely need to spend more on efficiency measures, recycling and conservation – to meet stringent regulations that could tighten even further. In the real estate market, tenant preferences are likely to shift toward green buildings. We use global real estate investment trusts (REITs) to illustrate how exposure to water stress can vary by location and over time. Our approach combines the geolocation of about 84,000 global REIT properties and mapping them to the 590 publicly listed REITs that own them. We then used the WRI’s “Aqueduct” model to assess REITs exposure to various water stress risks today and in the future. This provides deeper insights on water-related issues faced by companies than traditional assessments, in our view. The risks are not unique to real estate – and we see our approach as applicable across asset classes. Stress in SouthwestEstimated water stress in the U.S. by risk zone Source: BlackRock Investment Institute and BlackRock Sustainable Investing, with data from WRI and SNL, May 2020. The chart shows estimated water stress levels across the U.S. Southwest as of 2014 (actual) and 2030 (projected), using WRI data. Grey dots indicate properties held by listed global REITs, as identified by BlackRock using SNL’s database. Water stress is assessed on WRI’s five point scale, ranging from “low” to “extremely high” (1 to 5). We use the U.S. Southwest to illustrate our methodology. We use 2014 (actual) as our baseline because WRI’s data draw on an extensive modeling and simulation project ran by Utrecht University that spanned 1960-2014. This data represents the most recent and accurate global picture of water stress available, we believe. Key assumptions: Almost the entire U.S. Southwest, including states such as California, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, faces extreme water stress issues by 2030. Most of the current REIT properties in the region, indicated by the grey dots, lie in these high risk zones. Roughly 60% of the global REIT properties we were able to geolocate will experience high water stress by 2030, we find, driven by increased urbanization and the effects of climate change. This is more than double the number today. Water-related issues are not yet a material cash-flow driver for REITs, in our view, and the risks can be mitigated. Yet they may become more material over time due to knock-on effects such as regulatory shifts. Almost all REIT properties in Malaysia, Philippines, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia will likely be in high risk water zones by 2030, our analysis shows. Roughly two-thirds of today’s U.S. REIT properties will be at high risk of water stress by 2030, double the proportion today, we also conclude. Investors and tenants are increasingly focused on water stress, as well as other environmental factors such as energy efficiency, green certifications and carbon footprints. REITs that score highly on these metrics can potentially save costs, while screening as more “green.” This may make their equities more attractive to potential investors and their buildings more desirable for occupants. Water stress has wide-ranging implications across asset classes. We show how the agriculture, electric power and food and beverage industries may be most at risk. The creditworthiness of some countries, states and municipalities facing shortages could also come under threat as they face additional costs to fortify their water infrastructure. This comes on top of other growing physical climate risks such as exposure to flooding and other extreme weather events. Companies resilient to water stress and other climate-related risks may fetch a premium in the transition to a more sustainable world, we believe. Better understanding and quantifying the risks can help investors mitigate exposures and potentially exploit any mispricing. Related data and insights are valuable tools for investors to engage with companies and issuers on their sustainability-related efforts. Widening the lens How might the analysis be extended beyond REITs? Our geolocation-based approach can also be applied to unlisted real estate – and a host of other asset classes and sectors, we believe. The materiality of stress varies greatly across industries, as the Who’s at risk? graphic below shows. Relatively high water users such as the agricultural, electric power, and food and beverage sectors are among the biggest hot spots, this analysis from the WRI suggests. Who’s at risk? Water stress materiality matrix across major equity market sectors, 2020 Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from WRI, 2019. Note: The chart shows the materiality across industries of various physical risks related to the quantity of water supply (too little or too much). The scale ranges from not relevant (white), to low (lightest tone) and very high (darkest tone). WRI’s weights are based on information provided in corporate water disclosure reports and input from industry experts. For details on the methodology see Hofste, R., S. Kuzma, S. Walker, E.H. Sutanudjaja, et.al. 2019. “Aqueduct3.0: Updated Decision-Relevant Global Water Risk Indicators.” Available online at: https://files.wri.org/s3fs-public/aqueduct-30-updated-decision-relevant-global-water-risk-indicators_1.pdf All sectors represent WRI’s assessment, except for REITs, which is based on BlackRock’s analysis replicating the WRI methodology. For illustrative purposes only. The matrix assesses the materiality of various facets of water risk – ranging from baseline stress to coastal flooding and droughts – across industries. The focus here in on risks related to water quantity – either too much or too little. It does not address the full spectrum of water-related risks. Other components include risks related to declining quality (water that is unfit for use); as well as reputational and regulatory risks (such as conflicts with the public over poor management of wastewater). This illustrates the complexity of assessing risks across sectors – and the need to go beyond headline data. Yet we see it as a valuable starting point for assessing materiality of water stress across sectors. The impacts could be dire in the agricultural sector, with a direct link between water availability for irrigation and crop yields. Irrigated agriculture is, on average, at least twice as productive per unit of land as rainfed agriculture, according to the World Bank. Lack of water availability for cooling thermal power plants poses a serious risk to electric utilities. Some 27% of U.S. electric production would be severely impacted by steady increases in water stress by 2030, according to a 2017 study in Nature. Cities and municipalities in water stressed regions may also face investment costs on wastewater recycling and fortifying their infrastructure. This has implications for the debt of governments and municipalities. Moody’s, for example, said in a report in early 2020 that climate-related risks posed long-term risks to the creditworthiness of the greater-Sydney region in Australia. It identified water stress as the single greatest challenge. Challenges we plan to tackle include applying our analysis on water stress to companies with global supply chains. This would require a dataset identifying the location of all operating facilities of a firm so that the full exposure of companies – and their securities – can be determined. Our understanding of the connection between climate risk and financial risk is evolving – and further research is needed to quantify effects with greater confidence. To be sure, rising water stress is not a one-way street. It can possibly be mitigated through breakthroughs such as better irrigation and wastewater treatment, and advances in efficiency and desalination. Yet we have high conviction that water stress is a key component of climate risks that are set to grow increasingly financially material over time. This suggests the time to integrate them into investment processes is now. The financial implications Industrial and commercial activity accounts for the bulk of freshwater use around the world. The agricultural, textile, energy, industrials, chemicals, pharmaceutical and mining industries account for around 70% of usage, according to CDP’s 2018 Global water report. Residential and office use are part of the remaining 30%. The financial implications of reduced water availability are varied. Companies in water-stressed locations can face costs from disrupted production, higher capital expenditures, compliance and enforcement penalties. They may need to spend more to mitigate the effects of water stress, such as investments in efficiency, pollution abatement, re-use, recycling and conservation measures. The takeaway for investors: Companies that manage water resources better than their peers may offer more resilient earnings streams. The risks cut across sectors. Lack of water for irrigation and animal consumption threatens the food industry. Insufficient cooling water can cause brownouts in electric power plants, hurting electric utilities and their customers. Even the leisure industry may be affected: shortages in India in 2019 forced hotel closures. Water stress is expected to intensify in the decades ahead, in line with many of the other physical risks posed by climate change that we outlined in Getting physical of April 2019. One in two people will live in water-stressed locations by 2030, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) expects. Global water infrastructure costs are expected to rise fourfold to $150 billion annually from 2017 levels by 2030, the World Bank estimates. Who’s vulnerable?Water stress exposure by REIT market, 2014 vs. 2030 Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from SNL and WRI, June 2020. Notes: The chart shows the percentage of REIT properties in the top-20 global REIT markets that lie in regions with high water stress (zones 4 and 5 according to WRI’s framework), both as of 2014 (baseline) and 2030. Projections are based on WRI data. We used the SNL database to geolocate around 85,000 global REIT properties owned by listed companies. For illustrative purposes only. Forward-looking estimates may not come to pass. The chart above illustrates how this may play out in the global REITs Industry. Less than 30% of REIT properties today lie in regions with high water stress, according to WRI data. That proportion could more than double by 2030, assuming the footprint of REIT properties remains unchanged. Download full report '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sustainability factors are even more important in long-term private investments—a point that COVID is underlining.',\n",
       "  'content': \" Investors have increasingly prioritized environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards in recent years. Now an economic shock of historical proportions presents the first real-time test of sustainable investing. Will the crisis push governments and investors to prioritize growth over sustainability? Teresa O’Flynn, Global Head of Sustainable Investing for BlackRock Alternative Investors, explained why that is a false dichotomy in our recent webcast, Accelerating sustainability. The following is adapted from her conversation with Mark Everitt, Head of Investment Research and Strategy for BlackRock Alternative Investors. What was the state of play in sustainable investing before the current crisis? We’ve seen a rise in sustainable investing in recent years driven by a few key factors: Firstly, the increasing incidence and severity of extreme weather events are moving climate, which is just one aspect of sustainable investing, to center stage. Secondly, we are seeing a growing number of regulatory interventions around the globe putting ESG at the center of the asset management industry. Finally, society as a whole is placing increasing emphasis on sustainability, and we believe this represents a structural shift for investing. The culmination of these factors led BlackRock, in January, to commit to making sustainability our new standard for investing. We did this because we believe that sustainability- and climate-integrated portfolios can provide better risk-adjusted returns to investors over the long-term. Since then, of course, we’ve had the COVID shock, and questions about whether interest will wane in a downturn. But if anything, the reverse is true. Public market data backs this up - we have seen strong flows into sustainable products during this unique time. Global sustainable flows totaled US$44B across the industry in Q1—a 57% year on year increase. What’s different about ESG investing in private markets? Let’s start by defining what we mean by Sustainable Investing: Sustainable investing combines the best of traditional investing with ESG insights in order to generate better long-term outcomes for our clients. There are two major elements: ESG integration, which is about risk management and investment process and applies to all investment strategies. Over and above integration, sustainable investing also includes those strategies that target specific sustainable outcomes such as renewable power. ESG is relevant for both public and private markets but is arguably more important for private investing given the long term and illiquid nature of the asset class. It can also be harder to do in private markets. For one thing, private markets do not have the same data set, particularly on return implications. In public markets, we have seen studies from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and others showing positive links between ESG factors and performance over the last number of years. It also requires a much heavier lift in private markets. There are no third-party ESG ratings reports to rely on. Instead one has to do all the analysis from scratch on the way in – digging into environmental reports, working with external engineers or interviewing management. ESG also needs to remain top of the agenda once you own the asset - a key element of private market investing is hands-on day to day asset management. ESG issues will vary considerably depending on what sector you are in (energy v healthcare v IT) and even within the same sector ESG issues can be very nuanced project to project, so this becomes an asset by asset decision. How will the COVID 19 crisis impact sustainable investing? This crisis has forced us as investors to question our assumptions in fundamental ways across the board, and that's true for sustainability as well. Most of the sustainable investing strategies in the market today have been developed in the 12-year period since the GFC, so this is an important test. We have seen resilience of ESG factors in both public and private markets during this time. We have seen an increase in the importance of “S” issues: supply chains, employee health and safety, retention and community engagement are examples of some of the factors that have come to the fore as some of the most material issues for companies’ resilience in the current environment. Governance issues such as the strength of a company’s risk management procedures and business continuity plans have been tested. These areas have been a key focus for investment teams across our business. In many cases, we’ve seen that a focus on these ‘S’ and ‘G’ issues has increased financial resilience during this pandemic. Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, zeroed in on this point in a piece he published in The Economist last month. His observation is that where the last crisis taught banks hard lessons about leverage, this one will change how companies balance risk and resilience. We have entered a world in which firms that operate with minimal liquidity, stretched supply chains and token contingency plans face a harsh judgement. We think some of these lessons are already appearing. Let’s turn to public markets again for a moment. Sustainable strategies have not just held up relative to non-sustainable peers, they have also in some instances seen outperformance and accelerated flows. Per Morningstar, ESG active funds have generally outperformed non ESG counterparts over the first quarter of 2020. 70% of sustainable equity funds ranked in the top half of their Morningstar categories and 44% ranked in the top quartile. In private markets, the best example of the resilience of ESG factors that we have seen has been in our renewable power infrastructure strategy, which benefits not only from low correlations with broader markets but also its positioning within a long-term global energy transition. As for client interest, I’ve already mentioned the flows we’ve seen into sustainability strategies on the public side. Our client conversations indicate that this interest is equally strong on the private side, with growing recognition of the structural shift sustainable is creating and the attractive growth opportunities it’s creating. How do you see the future? Climate change will remain a top focus – we are spending more and more time developing our analytical capabilities around this. We view climate risk as investment risk. We believe that technology can be better leveraged in private markets ESG. In our Real Assets business, for example, we are working with GRESB – the leading Real Assets sustainable investing benchmark – to help define the best approach for collating, monitoring and reporting on key ESG data. In our renewables business, we have developed an innovative impact reporting methodology to better quantify and contextualize the real-world positive outcomes and enable comparison across sectors and regions. We also expect a growing emphasis on the ‘S’ in ESG. This is particularly relevant in private equity – which has a special duty as a change agent and an important participant in the corporate restructuring ahead. We are encouraged to see industry adoption of sustainability standards – through our private equity fund of fund business we believe we play an important role in demanding the highest standards from the GPs we work with. Through our direct private equity business, which is focused on flexible hold periods and longer time horizons, we think we’ve brought additional focus to incorporating ESG into the underwriting process in all its dimensions, from prudent use of leverage to attention to stakeholders, to cybersecurity and beyond. I’ll close by noting that this is not an easy agenda. There’s plenty of work ahead. And as a fiduciary, we see it as our role to help our clients carry it forward. \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'How ESG strategies have performed during the pandemic and why they will become increasingly important in the future.',\n",
       "  'content': \" Like all investment strategies, those focused on delivering exposure to positive environmental, social and governance (ESG) characteristics, in addition to financial returns, have been tested by the coronavirus crisis. To gauge how these strategies have held up, and what may be in store for ESG investors when we exit the crisis, Mike Pyle, Global Chief Investment Strategist for the BlackRock Investment Institute, hosted a Market Pulse Call with Brian Deese, Global Head of Sustainable Investing; Teresa O'Flynn, Global Head of Sustainable Investing for BlackRock Alternative Investors; and Thomas Callahan, Head of BlackRock's Global Cash Management Business. Following are highlights of their conversation. Investors have been under incredible strain this year—has the pandemic shaken their beliefs about the importance of sustainability? Quite the contrary. In the first quarter of 2020, we saw $44 billion in net inflows globally into sustainable strategies, which is the largest-ever quarterly inflow. And of course, this happened in a period when many traditional strategies were experiencing massive outflows. So, we think it’s safe to say that the response from investors has amplified how important they believe sustainability is in generating long-term value, regardless of how markets are behaving in the short term. We echo that belief and have strong convictions around both the value of sustainability and its importance in increasing portfolio resilience over the long term. We made a commitment in January to significantly expand our set of sustainable strategies to support our broader goal of democratizing access to sustainable investing. This is really all about making sure that wherever and whenever asset owners want to go sustainable, we can make it as easy as possible for them to do so. Before the crisis, a large percentage of the ESG conversation was centered around the E—environmental factors, including climate change. Has that changed? We’ve certainly seen social and governance concerns come to the fore. On the social side, the data coming from the customer base globally really underscores that people are looking for companies that are demonstrating, with actions not just words, that the health and safety of their employees and communities is paramount. Companies that were stronger in those areas have been rewarded, and we anticipate that to continue going forward. Regarding governance, there is a set of issues that is becoming more prominent and that we believe will become increasingly important as the response to the crisis evolves. In particular, the issues of dividends, stock buybacks and compensation. Governments globally are putting restrictions on companies that are seeking crisis assistance. We believe that in addition to these restrictions, there will also be increased stakeholder pressure on companies to prioritize managing these issues in a way that is reflective of the pain being felt across the economy. And that as we come through this crisis, there will be a lasting focus and pressure on these governance issues as well. All of that is not to say that the environmental-related issues and the climate issues are less relevant. In fact, this crisis really underscores how devastating a global physical threat like a health pandemic is, and there are clear parallels between the effects of the pandemic and the potential impact of large-scale climate changes. For ESG-minded alternative investors, renewable power has been an important asset class. How is the collapse in global energy demand affecting renewables? We've certainly seen a dampening in electricity demand, as a result of travel restrictions, reduced activity in commercial and leisure sectors, and a slowdown in manufacturing. But we believe these are short-term disruptions that won’t have any lasting impact on the long-term drivers of supply and demand in the renewable power market. The world is increasingly relying on electricity as a source of energy, and its share of total energy demand is expected to grow from about 20 to 45 percent by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. Meanwhile, the cost of wind and solar equipment has declined dramatically over the last five to 10 years—solar photovoltaic capital costs have fallen by 85% and onshore wind costs by 49% since 2010, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Wind and solar are very cost-effective sources of power and are very well-positioned to help meet global carbon-reduction goals. And the resilience of sustainability factors is evident in private renewable power infrastructure strategies. While many infrastructure sectors are GDP driven, renewables are a less economically sensitive asset class. The main return driver, wind and solar resources (i.e., “the weather”), is completely uncorrelated to general market factors including Covid-19, which highlights the diversification benefits of the asset class. What about renewables projects that are currently under construction? Are Covid-19 and related supply chain disruptions affecting them? In terms of supply chain disruption, it's important to highlight that China plays a key role in the supply chain for wind and solar power generation equipment as well as for lithium ion batteries, which are used in battery storage systems. China also plays a leading role in providing some of the materials required for construction, such as cranes and steel structures. So, disruptions of global supply chains certainly are having an impact on milestone delivery and completion dates for greenfield renewable projects. But overall we're seeing strong evidence of the resilience of renewable power as an asset class during these times. It's also important to point out that banks have generally remained willing to lend to new projects. Deals that had been under negotiation pre-crisis are generally closing on the original terms. We've seen a slight widening of spreads for new transactions, but this has been offset to some degree, or entirely, by a tightening of the underlying base rates. With construction projects, lenders are understandably spending more time looking at underlying schedules and trying to assess any Covid-related construction and equipment supply risks, but they are applying appropriate protective terms rather than abandoning transactions. Maintaining ample cash has been top of mind for many investors throughout this crisis—how have sustainable cash strategies weathered the storm? Some investors may be surprised to hear that there are ESG cash strategies, because it's really a new segment that just launched in early 2019. But it was one of the big growth stories in the cash markets in the last year: as an industry, we essentially went from zero ESG money funds to nearly $30 billion. We think one of the reasons that ESG cash strategies were so well received is that they don’t force investors to make a “value-versus-values” tradeoff. They offer similar or equal yields as non-ESG strategies, but they have a credible and authentic sustainability framework and risk methodology. Of course, when this crisis kicked in and the Fed announced an emergency 100 basis point rate cut in March, we saw wholesale outflows from institutional prime money funds, including ESG funds. This was not the reaction the Fed was hoping for, but it responded with a series of programs including the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to re-liquify and stabilize money markets. When the dust settled, we looked at AUM across the money market landscape to see how ESG strategies fared relative to traditional strategies during what was essentially a market seizure. And frankly, we were a little bit shocked when we first looked at the data. Not only did clients not run from green funds, they continued to allocate money. While institutional prime funds in the U.S. are still down approximately $100 billion in AUM, ESG funds have gained AUM. We think the reason for this increase is that investors recognize the additional resilience ESG can provide. Many ESG issues tend to play out over the long term, but this crisis has pulled some of these risks forward, and companies with better credentials are proving more resilient. By adding ESG as a consideration in credit analysis and portfolio construction, short-term investors were largely able to avoid forced selling and extreme volatility. Looking ahead, there is approximately $4 trillion sitting in government funds, and a month from now it looks as if those funds could be yielding zero, as we saw in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. As investor sentiment moves away from fear and back toward looking to improve returns on cash, we expect to see further adoption of strategies like ESG that can offer enhanced risk management, potential for improved return and a view toward values. Any other surprises that have come out of the crisis and any parting thoughts about the future of sustainable investing? Another thing that may surprise a lot of people is that if you look at the resilience of ESG strategies in the current downturn, it's not principally an energy story. While there are strategies that specifically screen for fossil fuel related companies, there are many ESG strategies that take a sector-neutral approach. When you isolate the attribution of the outperformance for those sector-neutral ESG strategies, you see that there is something beyond the energy piece that is driving resilience. Looking ahead, as institutions are reallocating back into risk assets, we think this will be a pivotal time for sustainable investing. The breadth and the quality of sustainable strategies, including building blocks like ESG cash offerings, are much greater than they were even one or two years ago. It’s now possible to embed sustainability throughout the portfolio construction process, and we think that the performance of sustainable strategies throughout this crisis is going to give them a tailwind moving forward. And the fact that almost all (94%) of the attendees to this call that answered our polling question believe that sustainability will become more important coming out of the pandemic lends credence to that view. \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Amid historic volatility, investors turned to sustainable strategies, and the strategies demonstrated their resilience.',\n",
       "  'content': ' The tremendous toll of the COVID-19 crisis – on health, economic well-being, and everyday activity – has precipitated a widespread reassessment of the way we live our lives. For governments, businesses, and investors, an essential question has been to understand the sources of resilience during these past few months and how to build on them to prepare for future crises. Global equity markets signaled the severity of the crisis before much of the world had begun its lockdowns. Equities began their steep descent in late February, and in the course of one month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 10,000 points (34%)1, demand for cash soared, and economic activity ground to a halt as businesses were forcibly shut down and people directed to stay inside. Amidst this volatile environment, investors have been seeking to understand what characteristics contributed to comparative resilience in portfolios’ performance and how to incorporate these characteristics in their own investments. The concept of sustainable investing can mean different things. Asset owners and asset managers often operate with multiple definitions, messages and motivations. BlackRock operates from a simple definition of sustainable investing: Combining traditional investing with environmental, social, and governance-related (ESG) insights to improve long-term outcomes for our clients. Our view: Companies with strong profiles on material sustainability issues have potential to outperform those with poor profiles. In particular, we believe companies managed with a focus on sustainability should be better positioned versus their less sustainable peers to weather adverse conditions while still benefiting from positive market environments. Download the full report The recent downturn was a key test of this conviction. In the first quarter of 2020, Morningstar reported 51 out of 57 of their sustainable indices outperformed their broad market counterparts, and MSCI reported 15 of 17 of their sustainable indices outperformed broad market counterparts - robust across region and index methodology.2,3 While this short time period is not determinative, it aligns with the resilience we have seen in sustainable strategies during prior downturns in 2015-2016 and 2018, which are explored in our research. Furthermore, these results are consistent with the research BlackRock has been publishing since mid-2018, demonstrating that sustainable strategies do not require a return tradeoff and have important resilient properties.4 For investors, the most important question is why? What explains the resilience? Research by BlackRock5 has established a correlation between sustainability and traditional factors such as quality and low volatility, which themselves indicate resilience. As a result, we would expect sustainable companies to be more resilient during downturns. Traditional factors, however, do not describe the full set of attributes that can impact a company’s resilience. Analyzing the various sustainability characteristics of companies – and how these characteristics contributed to performance – deepens our understanding of how sustainability reinforces resilience. Our research indicates that, in the current crisis, with its transformative and devastating impact on daily life, companies with a record of good customer relations or robust corporate culture are demonstrating resilient financial performance. Casual observers initially attributed the strong performance of ESG funds to their relative underweighting to traditional energy companies, whose prices fell further than the overall market during the downturn. However, our own analysis and third-party research6 shows that the underperformance of traditional energy explains only a fraction of the outperformance seen in many sustainable funds. We believe that the outperformance has instead been driven by a range of material sustainability characteristics, including job satisfaction of employees, the strength of customer relations, or the effectiveness of the company’s board. Overall, this period of market turbulence and economic uncertainty has further reinforced our conviction that ESG characteristics indicate resilience during market downturns. Another key piece of the resilience story has been investor preference for sustainable assets during the crisis. As investors have sought to rebalance their portfolios during market turmoil, they are increasingly preferring sustainable funds over more traditional ones. In the first quarter of 2020, global sustainable open-ended funds (mutual funds and ETFs) brought in USD 40.5bn in new assets, a 41% increase year-over-year. U.S. sustainable funds attracted a record USD 7.3 billion for the quarter.7 We believe these inflows during a period of extraordinary market drawdown suggests a persistence in investor preferences toward sustainability. They upend an oft-cited concern pre-COVID crisis that during sharp market downturns, investors will de-prioritize sustainability. And they offer important, though short-term, evidence that the incipient shift in preferences – which was explored in research by the BlackRock Investment Institute earlier this year8 – has been accelerated by the crisis and is another key contributor to the resilience of sustainable funds. In our research, we analyze performance differences between ESG indices and their core, non-ESG, versions, as well as ESG-managed funds versus their peers, and we find that the majority of ESG-tilted portfolios have outperformed their non-sustainable counterparts during this year’s market downturn. We also examine a variety of sustainability-related themes using our research-driven framework for assessing and integrating material sustainability insights to understand the performance of each theme during the downturn. We find particularly strong performance in themes including customer relations, firm culture, and board effectiveness, providing insight into resilience during this crisis. Finally, we explore the increasing allocation to sustainable portfolios during the crisis and the structural shift in investor preferences to sustainable assets. Download the full report '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BlackRock discusses its progress since committing to help clients achieve their sustainable investing goals. Learn more.',\n",
       "  'content': \" How we are helping our clients achieve their sustainability objectives May 2020 In recent months, the world has experienced perhaps the most severe crisis of our lifetimes. The pandemic has wrought extraordinary financial, economic, and human turmoil, and it has highlighted the importance of resilience amid uncertainty. During the past few months, we have seen that regardless of industry, strong sustainability characteristics have been essential to helping companies weather the crisis, and investors have increasingly sought out sustainable investment strategies. We continue to partner with our clients to achieve their sustainability objectives. In January 2020, we outlined a series of initiatives to make sustainability integral to the way that BlackRock manages risk, constructs portfolios, designs products, and engages with companies on behalf of our clients. At the center of these commitments is our investment view that sustainability-integrated portfolios can provide clients better long-term risk-adjusted returns. This view is grounded in two core convictions drawn from BlackRock research and investment insight: first, companies that better manage sustainability-related issues will be more resilient over the long-term; and second, we are on the front end of a profound, long-term structural shift in global investor preferences toward sustainability that is not fully priced into the market today and may therefore drive outperformance during a long transition period. Although the market disruption experienced in the first quarter of 2020 is a short timeframe, and therefore not determinative, it is consistent with the resilience of sustainable strategies that has been observed in past downturns, as detailed in new research, Sustainable investing: Resilience amid uncertainty, from BlackRock Sustainable Investing. During the recent downturn, we have observed two important trends during the crisis: Sustainable investment strategies globally proved resilient amid the market volatility of Q1 2020. Our own and third-party research demonstrated that sustainable indexes tended to outperform their parent benchmarks during Q1 (Morningstar reported 51 out of 57 of their sustainable indices outperformed their broad market counterparts, for example.1) Importantly, while some of the funds corresponding to these indexes have benefited from structural underweights to energy and utilities, we find that the greater resilience of sustainable strategies as compared to conventional index funds during this period was not principally the result of less exposure to energy.2 The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores of companies within sectors shows that ESG scores were material in differentiating between leaders and laggards across global markets – including the energy sector and energy sub-sectors such as oil and gas – during this period of severe volatility.3 Investor interest in sustainable investing strategies accelerated during this period of crisis. In February, BlackRock published research outlining our view that there would be a persistent and long-lasting shift toward sustainable assets that is not yet fully reflected in market prices. While some market commentators have speculated that the current crisis would slow this trend, during the first quarter of 2020, we actually saw an acceleration of this shift across the industry. Global sustainable mutual fund and ETF flows across the industry totaled US$40.5b in the first quarter of this year, with the U.S. seeing record inflows in sustainable strategies of US$7.4b.3 This is a trend that we expect to see through the current pandemic, the recovery, and long after. In the near term, we anticipate that some companies will need to reallocate resources from sustainability initiatives and reporting to address immediate priorities created by the pandemic and related economic fallout. Over time, however, we expect that, particularly among market leaders, companies will continue to enhance their focus on material sustainability management and reporting – and that this will be a key driver of long-term returns. During the past few months, BlackRock has been intensely focused on supporting our people and communities during the pandemic and helping our clients navigate the related market turmoil. During this time, interest in sustainable investing strategies among BlackRock clients has continued to grow, and BlackRock has seen US$15.5 billion in flows into sustainable strategies in the first quarter – our largest quarter on record for sustainable flows. With continued client interest in sustainability and sustainability’s growing importance as a factor in delivering investment returns, we have continued to advance the initiatives that we detailed for clients in January to make sustainability our standard for investing. Below is a summary of our progress in each of those areas since January. 1) Building sustainable, resilient and transparent portfolios We have been working to integrate sustainability into all aspects of portfolio construction. Sustainability in our portfolio solutions – In January, we said we intend to make sustainable funds the standard building blocks in the investment solutions we offer our clients wherever possible, consistent with client preferences and applicable regulations. Since January, client interest has been even higher than anticipated, and we have made significant progress in the past three months. Flagship models: Today, we have ESG model ranges available as key components of our lineup both in the U.S. and Europe, and we are actively building new ranges in Australia and Asia that we expect to be launched by the end of 2020.We have also integrated ESG offerings into our flagship Target Allocation and Managed Index Portfolios in the U.S. and Europe, respectively. Asset allocation solutions: We are pursuing asset allocation solutions to provide investors with a diversified, multi-asset sustainable portfolio in a single product. Retirement solutions: We’re taking the necessary steps and expect to launch a series of sustainable target date strategies in the U.S. These will be the industry’s first-ever set of index-based target-date products that seek to provide investors with an all-in-one, sustainable retirement solution – and consistent with our January commitment to develop a sustainable target date strategy. Cash management: In 2019, BlackRock created the industry’s first environmental sustainability-focused cash management strategy. Since then, we have continued to expand our ESG cash management offerings, converting an existing registered money market fund for US individual investors into the LEAF strategy and adding an investment option for Canadian institutional investors. Since its launch, assets across our full sustainable cash management product suite now total over US$12 billion.4 Strengthening sustainability integration into the active investment processes – In January, we detailed several steps to strengthen the integration of sustainability into our active investment processes. We committed that by the end of 2020, all active portfolios and advisory strategies would be fully ESG integrated in consultation with our clients - meaning that, at the portfolio level, our portfolio managers have accountability for appropriately managing exposure to ESG risks and documenting how those considerations are used in investment decisions. As of April 30, already more than 70% of the approximate 5,600 active portfolios managed by BlackRock have met both criteria. All of our active portfolios will be fully ESG integrated by the end of Q4 2020. Monitoring ESG risk in active strategies – In January, BlackRock’s Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (RQA) – which is responsible for evaluating all investment, counterparty, and operational risk at the firm – began evaluating ESG risk during its regular reviews with portfolio managers. This process will ensure that BlackRock’s core investment risk review procedures consider ESG risk alongside how we monitor traditional risk measures such as credit and liquidity risk. Today, each of our active investment strategies has an ESG integration framework used to govern how and when in the investment process material sustainability-related issues are considered. These integration frameworks serve as a benchmark for portfolio risk reviews and will be used alongside Sustainability Risk Exposure Dashboards, standardized dashboards, which analyze exposure to ESG risk and scores of portfolio holdings, in regular portfolio reviews between active portfolio managers and RQA. In addition to the regular portfolio reviews with RQA, portfolio managers across our active investment products, together with those groups’ Chief Investment Officers and RQA counterparties, conduct quarterly portfolio reviews to oversee performance and risk outcomes across active strategies. In Q1, these sessions began to include evaluation and documentation of ESG risk exposure and performance, as well as discussion of ESG considerations material to a fund’s investment objective. We anticipate that by Q2 this formal process will be in place across 100% of actively managed strategies. In heightening our scrutiny of ESG issues, we are continuously evaluating the risk-return profile and negative externalities posed by specific highest risk sectors and holdings as we seek to minimize risk and maximize long-term return for our clients. As a result of this scrutiny, we have no exposure today in the actively managed public debt or equity portfolios where we have investment discretion to certain sectors with heightened ESG risk, such as controversial weapons systems manufacturers or companies that generate more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal production. Strengthening our ESG data and analytics – BlackRock has been a leader in developing proprietary measurement tools to deepen our understanding of material sustainability risks. Earlier in May we announced a strategic partnership with Rhodium Group, a leading independent climate research firm, to combine their data and our risk modeling to develop physical climate risk analytics for multiple asset classes globally. Our existing Carbon Beta tool, developed last year to stress test issuers and portfolios for carbon pricing scenarios, was used by 28 distinct clients in Q1 2020, more than any other quarter before. In ESG analytics, we are expanding the depth and breadth of ESG data in Aladdin, delivering exponentially more data points. We are developing an ESG intelligence platform for the Aladdin Community to simply integrate ESG and understand related financial impacts. In April, we announced a partnership with Microsoft to catalyze innovation in data and technology that fosters sustainable corporate behaviors. Enhancing transparency of sustainable characteristics of investment products – To help investors clearly see the sustainability risks of their investments, we began last year displaying an ESG score and the carbon footprint, among other metrics, for the majority of iShares funds we offer globally. Subsequently, we have begun displaying sustainability characteristics not just for index funds, but for every retail fund, both index and active, that BlackRock offers across Europe, where available. By the end of 2020 we expect all BlackRock retail funds globally, both index and active, will feature these sustainable characteristics. We believe that this raises the bar for transparency across the industry. 2) Increasing access to sustainable investing Doubling our offerings of ESG ETFs – We committed in January to doubling (to 150) our offerings of ESG ETFs globally over the next few years so that clients have more choices to build their portfolios. Since January, we have launched 16 new ESG ETFs across Europe, the U.S. and Canada. We are also taking the necessary steps and expect to launch an additional 11 ESG ETFs in the months ahead in Europe, the U.S. and Latin America. Together these 27 new funds will increase our sustainable offerings to 105 ETFs. More importantly, these new offerings taken together continue to innovate and expand the breadth of ESG products to meet investor needs across a wide range of asset classes (such as fixed income), investment styles (such as minimum volatility) and markets (including new emerging markets like Mexico). Working with index providers to expand and improve the universe of sustainable indices – We committed in January to engage with major index providers to deliver sustainable versions of their flagship indexes to expand sustainable options for investors. We have delivered on this commitment to engage and expect to launch new sustainable funds based on flagship indexes later this year. We also recently announced an agreement with an equity index provider, which will help us to continue to grow our sustainable platform. Expanding company adoption of sustainable active investment strategies – Our global platform now has over 60 active sustainable products, spanning equity, fixed income and alternatives. New additions have included: We’ve launched a new sustainable money market mutual fund in the U.S. and we are taking the necessary steps and expect to launch five additional non-money market funds in the U.S. later this year. Our solutions include a new Global Equity Impact Fund in Europe that is aligned to the World Bank’s IFC Operating Principles for Impact Management, and we plan to have additional Impact solutions available in the U.S. in the coming months. In managing assets for our clients, BlackRock has assisted pension funds as well as other asset owners, such as endowments, transition into sustainable strategies. One such example of this is funding from the University of Illinois System into a new strategy that leverages BlackRock's proprietary sustainable investing framework. BlackRock also launched in April the first global unconstrained ESG total return bond fund with our UCITS Luxembourg flagship global fund range. The fund already has more than US$500 million in assets under management (AUM) and is the sister fund to BlackRock’s flagship global unconstrained UCITS fund with US$9.4 billion of AUM.5 3) Enhancing engagement, voting, and transparency in stewardship Investment stewardship is an essential component of our fiduciary responsibility. As we noted in January, we have been engaging for years with companies on sustainability issues as reflected in our annual engagement priorities and stewardship reports. Given the growing materiality of sustainability factors, our investment stewardship team this year has intensified focus and engagement with companies on sustainability-related risks and even more so in light of recent societal and market events. We believe these are clearly long-term drivers of value and risk. What we have learned in our engagements is that, as management teams and boards of directors grapple with the existential threats to their businesses stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, they are also cognizant of the fact that their actions today will have a direct impact on their social license to operate in the future. We have heard from companies first-hand how they are seeking to balance the interests of all stakeholders: shareholders, employees, clients, vendors, and their communities. Engagement priorities and voting guidelines – Consistent with the commitments we outlined in January, we updated our voting guidelines in nine markets to align with our January letter to clients. In addition, when we published our 2020 engagement priorities, we mapped them for the first time to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as Gender Equality and Affordable and Clean Energy. For each priority, we also added specific Key Performance Indicators for how we expect to hold boards accountable. We also published new engagement commentaries, detailing how we were engaging with companies on the following key sustainability issues: Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)-aligned reporting Climate risk Agribusiness companies on sustainable business practices Emissions, and Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy Promoting SASB and TCFD-aligned Reporting – BlackRock was not only a founding member of TCFD, but we have spent the past several years encouraging companies to increase disclosure aligned to TCFD and SASB. This was a key part of Larry Fink’s letter to CEOs this year. We are pleased that there has been a 180% increase in SASB reporters over 2018 levels, and SASB has reported a significant increase in the number of companies downloading their standards. As of February 2020, more than 1,000 companies, with a total market cap of US$12tn, had endorsed TCFD recommendations including more than 473 financial firms representing US$138.8tn of managed capital. This is an important area of engagement for our investment stewardship team this year, and we are gratified to see companies (such as Netflix and Sanderson Farms6) who, after engagement with many of their shareholders, have committed since January to integrate SASB reporting into their disclosures this year. Enhanced Transparency – Given the growing interest of clients and broader society in our stewardship efforts, we committed in January to set a new standard for the industry in transparency. Since then we’ve taken actions to deliver on these commitments, including publishing: Global quarterly stewardship report: provides case studies on individual engagements and data on the number of companies engaged with globally across a range of E, S and G topics, including COVID-19 related issues. Global quarterly engagement activity: a new summary with topic-level detail that includes a list of every company (688) with which we engaged in the quarter, as well as the topics of engagement. Quarterly vote disclosures: moved from annual to quarterly voting disclosure in which we provide a rationale for key votes Vote bulletins: detailing our votes and rationale for voting on complex or high-profile votes. As this year’s proxy season has got underway, this has already included bulletins on votes for 177 companies. Enhanced client reporting: Implemented a new capability through Aladdin to deliver portfolio-specific company engagement reports for our clients. BlackRock’s role as a fiduciary is the foundation of our business model and culture. As a fiduciary, we invest on our clients’ behalf, not our own, and manage their money consistent with their preferences. As a fiduciary, we also have an obligation to share our conviction that all investors – and especially those saving for long-term goals like retirement – should consider sustainability in their investments. The extraordinary events of 2020 have only reinforced that conviction. While the current environment has created unprecedented challenges for corporations, we firmly believe that over time a dedicated focus on managing ESG-specific risks will be essential to delivering sustainable long-term returns for long-term investors. \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'How well-structured deals and the ongoing global energy transition can benefit wind and solar investments in the current downturn.',\n",
       "  'content': ' Renewable energy was the most active sector in infrastructure investing last year, accounting for more than 50% of transactions, according to IJ Global. How is the market faring amid the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic? David Giordano, BlackRock’s Global Head of Renewable Power, gave his assessment as part of our recent Inspecting Infrastructure webcast. His team manages investments in wind and solar power generation, as well as power distribution and storage assets, across Europe, North America, and the Asia Pacific region. The following is adapted from his conversation with Mark Everitt, Head of Investment Research and Strategy for BlackRock Alternative Investors Tell us what you’ve been focusing on across the portfolio. With our construction projects, we’re paying close attention to potential supply chain and labor disruptions, which thankfully have not been major. To date, over a diversified portfolio, we are seeing only modest impacts to schedule. As for our operating fleet, these projects are largely operated remotely during normal times, and we continue to see consistent performance. Because we’re providing the essential service of electricity, we’re getting good local support for continued operations across all jurisdictions. We are monitoring the changes in near-term and longer-term power prices. Renewable power assets typically benefit from being highly contracted, especially in the early years. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the credit health of the offtakers as well as the forecasts for power prices. For utility scale projects, the counterparties have remained fundamentally strong credits. However, we are watching the impact on our commercial and industrial partners – both as off-takers and as service and warranty providers. On the financial front, the capital markets have maintained their support of the renewable power sector, and we have been able to complete several transactions in recent weeks. We speak quite a bit about the resiliency of the renewable power asset class and its benefits as a diversifier in client portfolios, and I think we’re seeing those benefits in the current environment. As the sun still shines and the wind still blows, our assets continue to perform well. The case for renewables rests in part on their role in an energy transition. Have recent events changed that? No, not at all. The collapse in oil prices has obviously been dramatic, but oil is mainly a transport fuel—it generates only a tiny percentage of the world’s electricity. Meanwhile, the structural drivers for the energy transition and the role of renewables in it are still very much in place. These drivers are mutually reinforcing. First, there’s the electrification of everything. Electricity has become the world’s preferred way of consuming energy, and its 19% share of energy demand is expected to grow to 45% by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. At the same time, we’re seeing continued cost declines for renewables.Solar PV capital costs have fallen by 85% and onshore wind costs by 49% since 2010, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Offshore wind has experienced a 32% cost decline in the last two years alone. Renewables are now cheaper than new coal across more than two thirds of the world. This is why the IEA’s 2040 projection estimates that two thirds of electricity at that point will be generated by renewables. In short, the global picture is a future of greater reliance on electricity, and greater use of renewables to produce that electricity. And that picture hasn’t changed. How has the pandemic affected the opportunity set in renewables? In the near term, we expect increased M&A opportunities as project sponsors look to sell projects, and power purchasers are focused on securing power at attractive prices to satisfy their climate goals, which haven’t changed despite the economic uncertainty. In the United States we expect to see an extremely active market toward the end of the year. There are a number of projects in the pipeline that will need capital partners to protect development value, and equity capital will have the most flexibility to manage risks and timing. With tax credits rolling off along with local permits and interconnection rights, time will be of the essence for many projects. We are currently in exclusivity on a portfolio of projects for commercial and industrial customers that will need to be done in time to qualify for existing tax benefits. We are also re-engaging on a large wind opportunity in the US. This was an auction process where the sponsor is now more focused on the ability to complete the transaction. How do the opportunities look in other parts of the world? The Asian opportunity remains a core part of our overall global strategy. Bloomberg New Energy Finance projects that 50% of the world’s electricity will be consumed in the APAC region by 2030 and that just over 40% of all new invested capital in the climate infrastructure space will be deployed in the region in the next decade. In Taiwan, we are working with a developer to secure equity rights in several projects. Taiwan saw over a gigawatt of new solar installations in 2019, which is just the start of their energy transition. We are working with two developers in South Korea on projects that will cover onshore wind and solar assets spread across the county. South Korea is also just implementing their feed-in tariff program to facilitate the energy transition, and these projects will benefit from 20-year power purchase agreements. Europe continues to offer a diverse opportunity set, but you need to be increasingly selective about geographies and sectors. The Nordics and Iberia offer attractive relative value whereas countries like the UK and Germany have recently seen a mismatch between the reduced opportunity set and large flows of domestic capital. Our team has been evaluating both sides of this market dynamic. For example, we are working on completing acquisitions in Portugal, while looking to divest assets in the UK. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tony DeSpirito discusses its potential impact on ESG investing and how it may hasten an important trend for active investors.',\n",
       "  'content': ' The COVID-19 pandemic has been extraordinary in countless ways. Beyond the deeply felt strains on health and humanity, it is an economic and social issue with generational consequences. We believe it could also be a defining moment for environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. From a social perspective, we expect companies will be remembered and rewarded on their actions during this crisis. The societal role of corporations has been illuminated like never before, and we expect business will go to those companies deemed to have done the right thing by their employees, customers and communities in this most trying of times. From an environmental perspective, we could see this crisis bringing even greater attention to the impacts of climate change. Coronavirus has made it clear that when it comes to human vs. nature, the upper hand goes to nature. Many may begin to take environmental issues more seriously. Both of these spur important considerations for investors. Active investing with an ESG lens ESG issues are not new considerations in our fundamental investment process. But they are increasingly important ones. Society, voters, regulators and investors are all placing greater focus on ESG. The portion of active equity assets directed to ESG mandates is on the rise and, not surprisingly, mentions of “ESG” in broker reports have spiked, as shown below. ESG earning more attention Percentage of firms with at least one broker report that mentions “ESG” Source: BlackRock and BTAP, Dec. 31, 2019. The graph shows the percentage of firms with mentions of “ESG” (ex “ESG score”) using available BTAP data and shown as a percentage of Russell 1000 Index constituents. The Russell 1000 is an unmanaged index of the 1,000 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. ESG interest in the U.S. is in early innings and gaining momentum, we believe. We see this offering opportunity for active stock investors for three key reasons: 1. Current ESG measurement is imperfect. Fundamental investors can capitalize on the confusion. Data providers assign headline ESG scores to thousands of companies globally, but there are shortcomings: Not all companies are rated. Where there are ratings, they are based primarily on company disclosures. ESG ratings are not always comparable, as scorers apply their own methodologies. Disagreements are not uncommon. The table below shows utilities is the No. 1 ESG scorer according to data provider MSCI but is ranked 10th of 11 sectors by Sustainalytics. Similar discrepancies are evident in individual company ratings. Given ample room for interpretation, fundamental investors can overlay their own analysis and uncover potential opportunities and risks. ESG scoring doesn’t always agree Sector ESG rankings as determined by top-two data providers Source: BlackRock, MSCI and Sustainalytics. The table uses ESG ratings from MSCI and Sustainalytics and is current as of Feb. 15, 2020. 2. ESG value is not fully reflected in stock prices. This means opportunity to access future alpha potential on the cheap. While it is widely accepted that ESG can be a valuable risk factor, we increasingly believe it can be an alpha factor as well. Our analysis of valuations and ESG score for U.S. stocks showed little correlation between the two ― stocks broadly are not priced in accordance with their ESG merit. We believe this will change as the industry places higher value on ESG, and presents an opportunity for active stock pickers. We find that ESG as a price driver varies by sector. For example, environmental considerations are value creators in utilities and energy, making ESG a relatively high explanatory factor for companies in these sectors. But ESG is baked into few other sectors today, and is even less embedded in individual stock pricing. Fundamental investors can look through the top-line score and dig into the E, S and G components to identify the materiality of each and the extent to which they may or may not be reflected in stock prices. 3. ESG is not a fad. Once ubiquitous, the opportunity will be in anticipating changes to ESG scores. We see ESG as an enduring market theme. It is no longer only about controversies and downside risks. ESG issues will impact company fundamentals and valuation multiples. Environmental concerns, for example, can result in changes to consumption preferences, which in turn affect revenue and operating margins. Social issues can sway voting tendencies, which in turn affect regulations and even tax rates. Once ESG is more fully reflected in market pricing, the opportunity will be in predicting changes to ESG scores. As fundamental investors who actively engage with companies on these matters, we believe this offers an opportunity to gain important insight, see beyond the headline score and extract alpha potential over the long term.

       "  'content': ' A commonly held view is that a return sacrifice is needed when adopting sustainable investing. We disagree – and in fact believe the opposite is true. We believe there is a fundamental point that is often overlooked with sustainable investing. There will likely be long transition unfolding over years and decades, driven by investment flows, that will reshape all asset prices. Because these flows are in their early stages, we believe that the full consequences of a shift to sustainable investing are not yet in market prices – and a return advantage can be gained during this transition. Just getting started The past year has seen a marked shift in society’s attitudes toward sustainability. This shift is spurring political pressure, a regulatory push and technological advancements to create the foundations of a more sustainable world, leading to a change in investor behavior and setting in motion a major yet gradual capital reallocation. Society’s long transition toward the practice of sustainable investing is likely to drive market adjustments for years and even decades. This tectonic shift has significant implications for the expected returns and relative pricing of assets not just those perceived to be sustainable but for every asset in the investment universe. The consequences could not just alter existing return drivers or risk premia but create entirely new sources of premia. One commonly held view argues that sustainable investing is not going to offer much return opportunity to investors from a basic financial theory perspective. This view holds that today’s prices should fully reflect the predictable component of future flows into sustainable assets that is, the adoption of sustainable investing is already at a “steady state” reflected in current prices. We believe the commonly held view is not just wrong but that the opposite will occur. The coming capital reallocation is not yet in prices: this long transition in sustainable preferences and practices will make some assets more expensive (those with high sustainability) and others cheaper (those with low sustainability). This means that assets with high sustainability will be rewarded through the long transition period, the opposite of what others posit. All about the flows There are three channels through which sustainability will change investment: profitability, risk and investor flows. The industry is typically focused on the first two: research has helped quantify the impact of sustainability on profitability and risk in different industries. Yet we believe the third channel is underappreciated – and far more important: the impact of major flows driven by the widespread adoption of sustainable investing during the long transition period. Our argument that flows will drive a “sustainability wave” is about much more than just the idea that today’s youth and their preferences affect market pricing. Though this contributes to the story as we discuss below the sustainability wave and its market impact is about a broader shift in preferences spanning all generations and societies. The sustainability wave is not purely about demographics. But it provides a parallel. Just as the baby boom generation’s impact on the economy and financial markets played out through taste preferences and wealth flows, the sustainability wave will play out over decades, remaking economies and industries as capital is reallocated. One contributing factor to the wave is, however, demographically induced: an ongoing transfer of wealth to a younger generation with greater awareness of sustainability. Millennials and Gen Xers are expected to gain a major share of assets. Some might argue that the younger generation’s preference for sustainability may dampen if not reverse as they age. Yet academic literature underscores that the personal experiences of economic fluctuations play an important role in persistently shaping individual preferences, especially at a younger age. As our paper Getting physical highlights, the number of natural disasters causing U.S. $1 billion plus in damages has been on a steady rise. Major negative shocks related to sustainability from hurricanes and wildfires in the U.S. and Australia, heat waves in Europe and flooding around the world may result in a durable shift in the younger generation’s taste towards more sustainable assets. A systematic approach While the transition period toward a new steady state could last decades, the resulting returns we expect during the transition should impact the strategic asset allocations built today. To meet these challenges, a portfolio construction framework needs to allow for: The impact of climate change and other sustainability effects on fundamental macro variables A clear link between the impact of these altered macro variables and the risk and return for all assets A means of allowing for the time-varying nature of the return and risk impact The creation of new sustainability premia that involves identifying factors that exhibit the sustainability premia and discounts within and across various asset classes A systematic means of building portfolios to reflect the inherent uncertainty applied to all future estimates Deriving a set of factors and rewards to sustainability – from which to create these new CMAs – is not trivial. Our flows-based concept is intuitive and drives the sustainability premia. The challenge is quantifying the impact. Our argument is built on the idea that what’s priced now doesn’t reflect what will be priced in the future. We instead identify exposures that capture sustainability using BlackRock’s proprietary sustainability metrics across asset classes. In our framework, whether these metrics have historically explained returns is secondary to whether they capture sustainability. To these identified exposures, we would ascribe a reward or discount by combining estimates of steady-state premia and the time-varying return impacts of the transition period until that steady state is reached. While quantification of this is difficult, there are different parallels from history that are informative. The pace at which markets price in slow-moving effects has precedent.
