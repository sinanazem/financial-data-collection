Such behavior isn’t entirely surprising to students of economic theory; perhaps the most fundamental concept in economics is that lower prices attract more buyers.

The U.S. Treasury index has never had such a poor first half-of-the-year return since its inception in 1973, and by some measures the 10-Year U.S. Treasury note has, astoundingly, experienced its worst first half since 1788, at least according to Deutsche Bank research as of July 1.

       "  'content': \"Conversation with BlackRock's Fixed Income Portfolio Managers\\nWe met with the portfolio managers of BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities to have a wide-ranging discussion on their approach and why it’s so well suited to the current market environment.\\nRick, perhaps you could please start us off by discussing why you think pursuing an opportunistic and unconstrained fixed income approach is particularly important in today’s market environment, and then afterward we can get into precisely what that approach entails?\\nRieder: Sure thing. Well, I think the extraordinary turmoil we’ve seen in the economy and markets over the past few years, and the ability of our unconstrained strategy to both open up additional avenues of return generation during that time, while also protecting client capital on the downside, illustrates well some of its benefits versus an approach that is solely tethered to a traditional benchmark, like the Bloomberg U.S. Agg Index. Let me be more specific: in the past few years, investors have gone from being primarily worried about a growing trade war between the U.S. and China, to a multi-year global pandemic that we’re still struggling through and an extremely contentious U.S. election, which held huge policy implications.\\nNow, most recently, the Russian war with Ukraine and its shock to energy and commodity markets, at a time when inflation was already running hot, has added greatly to investor concerns. Further, as a result of inflationary pressures, we’ve seen a fairly abrupt about-face in developed market monetary policy that has sent markets into more turmoil. Throughout all these events, the prospects for economic growth, labor markets, inflation and monetary and fiscal policy have gyrated wildly. And it’s in that context that an active and flexible approach to fixed income can be most valuable, in my view, and I’m extremely proud about how our team has navigated these varying crosscurrents.\\nTo better understand the current investment landscape, let’s focus on inflation, since it’s largely through these dramatic price increases that we’re seeing the turn in monetary policy reaction function and the recent rise in interest-rates. With the Federal Reserve focused on inflation, and the market focused on the Fed, it’s not surprising to see meaningfully elevated volatility across many asset classes in recent months. The fact is that these factors, as well as a loosening of policy in China, could prolong the raw material (cost-push) inflation that has made its way into consumption baskets over the last year.\\nAt the same time, higher wages, which are usually a welcome development for an economy, look to be more correlated to broad prices than they have been in decades, threatening a “wage-price spiral” that could keep inflation hotter for longer. Yet, while wages and prices may be correlated, evidence suggests that causation in recent times is more driven by price than by wage, giving us some comfort that wages won’t cause prices to spiral out of control. At the same time, a common saying in the commodity markets seems to be ringing true again, namely that ‘the cure for high prices is high prices.’ As a result, consumer confidence around durable goods purchases is at the lowest level in at least a decade and aggregate credit card spending on electronic and home goods is down from a year ago.\\nAll told, while Fed Funds futures markets are pricing in several policy rate hikes over the next year and a half, or so, it’s not entirely clear the Fed will be able to execute on its plan. In other words, on almost all fronts, we’re witnessing maximum uncertainty. That uncertainty combined with the historically low yields of recent years and the tremendous shocks the market has faced of late (inflation and policy shifts) have led to dramatic drawdowns in fixed income markets (see Figure 1).\\nFigure 1\\nFor the U.S. Agg Index, only the Volcker shock was greater\"},\n",

The upshot: an opportunity for stock pickers to apply their company-level research and analysis to separate potential winners and losers.\\nOne caveat is that this is likely to occur within a new regime. As we discuss in our latest market outlook, the Fed is intent on raising interest rates to fight inflation and must balance the risk that creates for economic growth. In the end, we expect the world to look different from the low-rate, tame-inflation environment that had prevailed since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008.\\nAgainst this backdrop, investors may want to consider revisiting their portfolios with a focus on three key elements that we believe are well-suited to the new order taking shape.\\n1. Value investing\\nValue stocks have a history of outperforming their growth counterparts in times of rising rates and inflation. This is because the cash flows of value companies are front-end loaded. Growth stocks, in contrast, are considered longer-duration assets with expectations of greater cash flows further into the future. These farther-off cash flows get discounted by higher rates, giving value stocks an upper hand in an inflating environment.\\nIn a BlackRock Fundamental Equities analysis of growth versus value stocks using data since 1927, we found value had achieved greatest outperformance in periods of moderate to high inflation. It was only when inflation was very low that value performance paled. Value stocks have also tended to perform well amid rising interest rates. Over the past 40 years, a sizable portion of value returns has come during periods of rising rates, as shown below.\\nA strong showing as rates rise\\nValue returns amid rising vs. falling rates, 1978-2020'},\n",

Amid a new era of unprecedented quantitative tightening, markets have entered a phase of persistently higher volatility and growing uncertainty with potentially broad investment implications.\\nMacro volatility driving equity markets\\nFollowing the pandemic recovery and start of the war in Ukraine, market focus has been dominated by upside surprises in inflationary data. In the US, elevated headline inflation readings have caused the Federal Reserve (“Fed”) to retire the term “transitory” and kick off an aggressive tightening cycle. The Fed raised rates by 0.75% in June, the largest increase since 1994. Several other developed market central banks followed in a rush to normalize policy, joining the Fed and emerging market central banks who had already kicked off tightening cycles.\\nWe have entered a new regime with macro factors driving asset prices and contributing to a higher level of volatility than we’ve seen in recent decades.

A spectrum of long-term and short-term themes are increasingly influencing which companies lead the way as economies grow and markets evolve. The top themes over the last four years capture nearly 25% of US equity market returns on average, a trend that’s accelerated since the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020.1 This has led to a broad industry shift with assets managed in US-listed thematic funds growing over 10x from $13bn in 2016 to $148bn in 2021.2\\nOur research also indicates that themes have the potential to deliver differentiated alpha when used alongside other investment strategies. A hypothetical US thematic portfolio using a systematic approach demonstrates an average excess return correlation of -0.06 to the largest strategies in the U.S. Large Blend category and -0.02 to US factors.3 Delivering both return potential and portfolio diversification, thematic investing has risen in prominence as a way to build alpha-seeking portfolios.\\nDecoding investment themes\\nWe think of themes as dynamic topics that are front-of-mind for investors, persist for some time, and have demonstrated an ability to drive equity market returns. Within BlackRock Systematic, we have developed a data-driven approach that seeks to identify, capture, and evaluate themes at scale.\\nA dynamic landscape\\nA broad range of structural and transitory themes drive markets at any given time. At one end of the spectrum, we have structural megatrends expected to shape the long-term trajectory of the economy like technological innovation, demographic shifts, and climate change. At the other end, we have evolving short-term trends driven by policy shifts, investor sentiment, and unforeseen developments—like a global pandemic, supply chain challenges, and inflationary pressures. Our systematic framework for thematic investing helps us to identify and reconcile both.\\nWe can begin to understand how themes develop by assessing the attention that they receive using natural language processing (“NLP”) techniques. By nature, themes create a persistent flow of news as topics that investors are researching, corporate officers are addressing in conference calls, and the press if publishing. Leveraging this volume of textual sources, we can begin to quantify the flow of information dictating a theme’s relevance and life span.\\nAttention metrics that count mentions of themes in financial news can help to differentiate short-term and long-term trends'},\n",

Following a solid first day, stocks quickly reversed and have been grinding lower ever since. But until recently it was not all stocks: Value stocks offered a degree of protection. That changed in June, with value going from leader to laggard. To the extent investor fears are shifting from inflation to recession, a quick value recovery is unlikely.\\nValue hits the “recession” wall\\nAside from energy, few sectors or styles have produced positive returns in 2022, but until recently value consistently outperformed. From the start of the year through the end of May the Russell 1000 Value Index outperformed the broader U.S. market and growth indexes by roughly 8% and 17% respectively. The catalysts for the outperformance were cheap valuations, a strong economy and rising interest rates.\\nWhat changed? Simply put: the source of investor anxiety. While inflation remains a stubborn problem, inflation expectations are falling fast. Since mid-June five-year inflation break evens, derived from the Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) market, have fallen by more than 0.50%, from nearly 3.2% to roughly 2.6%.\\nAs inflation expectations have dropped, so have real-time measures of economic activity. The ISM Manufacturing New Orders Index, one of the most closely watched leading economic indicators, has plunged to just below 50. A broad recession is still not assured, but manufacturing is slowing on the back of falling consumer demand and excess inventory.\\nApart from a rapidly decelerating economy, value has lost another tailwind: rising rates. Bank stocks, which benefit from higher rates and a steeper yield curve, led the market earlier in the year. Along with energy and materials, banks were viewed as a haven in an environment of higher inflation and interest rates. However, with lower rates and a narrower yield curve banks have surrendered much of their gains. Banks turned sharply lower in June and are now underperforming the market year-to-date by approximately 4.50%.\\nA cooling economy and bond market reversal have resulted in value now trailing more defensive investment styles. In June, value underperformed both the broader market and growth. Instead of value, investors are seeking safety in low volatility and high dividend paying stocks (see Chart 1).\\nMSCI World factor index 1-month performance'},\n",

       "  'content': '2022 has been a year marked by volatility for markets. At the heart of this market volatility is inflation uncertainty, which results in policy uncertainty. The U.S. Federal Reserve (“Fed”), once the leader of “team transitory” is shifting its strategy. Heading into the second half of the year, the path of rate policy will have great implications for market returns, recession risk, long-run inflation, and the durability of the 60/40 portfolio.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Russ Koesterich, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager, of the Global Allocation team details what needs to change for bonds to be an effective hedge again.\\nAt a time when investors desperately need a way to hedge equity risk, their most reliable tool is still broken: bonds. While bond yields have steadied in recent weeks, economic and financial conditions are still not supportive of bonds resuming their role as a hedge.\\nI last discussed bonds as a hedge in March. At the time I suggested that while the war in Ukraine created a “safe-haven” bid, bonds still had a pair of problems: inflation and the Federal Reserve. Until inflation really slows, bonds remain as much a source of risk as a hedge.\\nTo be fair, some things have changed since March. Bond prices have tumbled, and yields have risen. U.S. 10-year nominal yields are 1% higher and real -- i.e., inflation-adjusted -- yields have risen by approximately 1.2%, with real yields now above the post-global financial crisis (GFC) average. Nor are bonds the only asset class that has struggled. The S&P 500 has lost about 15% since the March peak.\\nBoth stocks and bonds are reacting to stubbornly higher prices and tighter financial conditions. Headline inflation has remained at multi-decades highs. And while core prices have slowed, various measures of core inflation remain at more than double the Fed’s stated target.\\nWith the Fed still struggling to lower inflation, financial conditions have continued to tighten. One measure of this, the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index, is now suggesting the tightest financial conditions since the spring of 2020. This dynamic continues to create a significant headwind for stocks, bonds, and the broader economy.\\nStill not working when needed most\\nWith inflation high and the Fed locked into a tightening cycle, stock/bond correlations remain materially higher than the post-GFC norm (see Chart 1).  This translates into bonds being more likely to fall than rise when stocks drop. Since the start of the year, long duration bonds fell an average of -0.1% on days when the S&P 500 is lower. When stocks really tumble, bond losses tend to be even worse. There have been 11 days when the S&P 500 has declined by 2% or more. On those occasions the average return for long duration U.S. Treasuries has been roughly -0.60%.\\nCorrelation of bond and equity returns'}]"
