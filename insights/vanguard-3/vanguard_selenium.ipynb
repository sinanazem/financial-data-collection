       "  'content': 'On August 16, 2022, Vanguard announced its plans to launch Vanguard Global Environmental Opportunities Stock Fund. The actively managed fund will hold a concentrated portfolio of companies that both are involved in the process of decarbonization and derive at least half of their revenue from activities deemed by the fund\\'s advisor to contribute positively to environmental change. The fund will be managed by Ninety One, an experienced active investment manager with a proven track record in environmental, decarbonization, and global investing.\\n\"Vanguard has been thoughtful and deliberate in building out our ESG lineup by ensuring each new fund addresses investors\\' enduring needs\" said Dan Reyes, head of Vanguard Portfolio Review Department. \"We are confident that Ninety One\\'s differentiated approach to global ESG investing will add long-term value for risk-tolerant investors who have a preference for environmental investing.\"\\nFounded in 1991, Ninety One manages approximately $160 billion globally.1 The Global Environmental Opportunities Stock Fund takes a structured, research-driven approach to investing that targets companies seeking to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon world. Ninety One\\'s investment philosophy is cemented in the conviction that there are structural growth opportunities resulting from trends in regulation, technology, and consumer preferences, which are driving a multi-decade energy transition. The firm believes that companies that successfully navigate this transition are likely to create value for investors over the long term. This will be the first Vanguard fund advised by Ninety One.\\nThe fund is designed for environmentally conscious investors who have a high tolerance for risk and want to augment a broadly diversified portfolio with a satellite position. The fund is expected to launch in the fourth quarter of 2022 with a competitive expense ratio of 0.75% for Investor Shares and 0.60% for Admiral Shares, compared with the industry average of 0.99% for similar funds.2 The fund\\'s minimum investments are $3,000 for Investor Shares and $50,000 for Admiral Shares.\\nVanguard\\'s ESG lineup\\nVanguard takes a disciplined, research-based approach to product development and has thoughtfully expanded its lineup of ESG funds, introducing funds and ETFs that exhibit enduring investment merit while addressing investors\\' evolving preferences. The new fund will complement Vanguard\\'s existing ESG lineup, including its two existing actively managed ESG funds. The recently launched Vanguard Baillie Gifford Global Positive Impact Stock Fund is designed for clients who want a strategy that targets both investment and impact objectives. Vanguard Global ESG Select Stock Fund caters to clients who want to maximize returns while having greater exposure to companies with attractive ESG characteristics. Vanguard also offers exclusionary-screened index equity and fixed income ETFs for investors who want to avoid or reduce exposure to certain sectors or ESG risks in their portfolio.\\n1 Data as of June 30, 2022.2 Sources: Morningstar, Vanguard.\\nNotes:\\nRegistration statements relating to Vanguard Global Environmental Opportunities Stock Fund have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) but have not yet become effective. The SEC has not approved or disapproved these securities or passed upon the adequacy of either fund\\'s preliminary prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is considered a criminal offense. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statements become effective.

Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other important information about a fund are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing.\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.\\nESG funds are subject to ESG investment risk, which is the chance that the stocks or bonds screened by the index provider for ESG criteria generally will underperform the market as a whole or, in the aggregate, will trail returns of other funds screened for ESG criteria. The index provider\\'s assessment of a company, based on the company\\'s level of involvement in a particular industry or the index provider\\'s own ESG criteria, may differ from that of other funds or of the advisor\\'s or an investor\\'s assessment of such company. As a result, the companies deemed eligible by the index provider may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics. The evaluation of companies for ESG screening or integration is dependent on the timely and accurate reporting of ESG data by the companies. Successful application of the screens will depend on the index provider’s proper identification and analysis of ESG data. The advisor may not be successful in assessing and identifying companies that have or will have a positive impact or support a given position. In some circumstances, companies could ultimately have a negative impact, or no impact.\\nVanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.\\nInvestments in securities issued by non-U.S. companies and governments are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk. These risks are especially high in emerging markets.'},\n",

Their desire has made environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, also known as socially responsible, faith-based, values-driven, or sustainable investing, a burgeoning trend.1\\nIt\\'s true that you can help align clients\\' investments with their preferences using off-the-shelf ETFs and mutual funds. But for clients with very specific ideas about causes or issues they want their investments to support or exclude, Vanguard Personalized Indexing could be a more precise solution.\\nGet more than \"E\" for environmental\\nLike many people, your clients may focus mostly on the \"E\" of ESG—that is, environmental concerns like a company\\'s carbon footprint or involvement with fossil fuels—but ESG investing can cover a much wider range of issues. For example, your clients can:\\n\\nIncorporate religious preferences into their portfolios.\\nAvoid investing in companies involved in activities they find objectionable, such as predatory lending or gambling.\\nSupport companies that pay their workers a fair living wage or that advance diversity on the board of directors.\\nChoose multiple issues to tailor the portfolio\\'s focus to suit their preferences. A client could focus on specific social issues as well as climate change, for example.\\n\\nWhat makes a personalized indexing portfolio so flexible? It\\'s all in the structure—and its easy-to-use technology. With mutual funds or ETFs, investors own a single fund that bundles individual stocks together. With a Vanguard Personalized Indexing portfolio, investors own individual stocks directly in separately managed accounts (SMAs). The stocks in each SMA represent a benchmark that you and your client select. Direct ownership of each stock makes an SMA fully customizable—you can build portfolios that precisely reflect each client\\'s preferences and outlook.\\nCustomize SMAs with screens and tilts\\nYou can use negative screens, positive tilts, or a combination of both to tailor your clients\\' portfolios with personalized indexing.\\n\\nA screen eliminates certain companies, sectors, or industries from a client\\'s portfolio entirely, according to criteria each client selects. For example, your client might want to avoid any investment with companies that produce adult entertainment or nuclear weapons, or that violate their religious principles. You can even screen out a single company if a client has strong feelings against investing in it.Use screens in cases where you need to ensure that all companies that violate a client\\'s principles are excluded from the portfolio.\\nTilts add a preferential weight to a portfolio that helps improve its focus on topics that are important to a client. In contrast to the black-and-white exclusion of screens, you can use tilts to help clients support issues that fall within a gradient. Examples include weighting a portfolio with companies that are moving toward a lower carbon footprint or are increasing the number of women in leadership roles.Think of it this way: Tilts let clients express support of companies that engage in \"good\" behavior on an issue, whereas screens let them express disapproval of \"bad\" behavior by a company.2\\n\\nVanguard Personalized Indexing offers a wide range of screens and tilts for your clients to choose from. You can also request custom options, such as faith-based or vegan. Once your clients have made their selections, you can generate impact and performance reports on demand, so clients can have a clear picture of the impact of their customizations.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nHarness the power of Vanguard Personalized Indexing\\nRequest a demo today to discover how Vanguard Personalized Indexing can help deliver additional value to you and your clients.Explore Vanguard Personalized Indexing\\n\\n\\nKeep an eye on customization and risk levels\\nVanguard Personalized Indexing is a flexible, transparent way to customize a client’s portfolio, but sometimes customizations can require special consideration from you.\\n\\nTracking error: You can apply as many customizations to clients\\' personalized indexing portfolios as they wish. However, each customization can potentially increase tracking error from the portfolio\\'s underlying benchmark, increasing a client\\'s risk.\\nLimited market exposure: A client who wants to screen out all companies that have engaged in controversial activities could be left with very few companies to invest in, potentially limiting their exposure to the market and reducing their portfolio’s diversification benefits.\\nContradictory tilts: When too many tilts are chosen, they tend to cancel each other out, diluting the client\\'s desired impact.\\n\\nIn these cases, you can help your clients understand that positive impact doesn\\'t require perfection. Together, you and your clients can prioritize their goals. That way, you can ensure that each personalized index is customized effectively and that clients are comfortable with the risk level in their portfolios.\\nDeepen client relationships\\nVanguard Personalized Indexing gives you the power to offer clients a highly personalized, index-based, tax-efficient solution that incorporates their unique preferences. It can also give you an opportunity to forge deeper emotional connections with your clients as you discuss their varying interests and experiences and how they might want to incorporate them into their investments.'},\n",

Comparison evaluated on annualized total return of the Emerging Markets Debt Funds Average.\\n\\xa0Why emerging markets bonds?\\nEmerging markets debt stands out from other parts of the credit market for three reasons.\\nPerformance history\\nEmerging markets external debt (dollar-denominated bonds of emerging markets sovereign issuers) has a long history of strong risk-adjusted returns as this chart shows:\\nAn asset class with an intriguing risk-return profile\\n20-year horizon, from March 31, 2002–March 31, 2022\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, using data from Bloomberg, J.P. Morgan, S&P Dow Jones Indices, MSCI, and Russell.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index. \\nNote: Volatility calculated as annualized standard deviation of monthly returns.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nGreater global diversification\\nEmerging markets debt is significantly more diversified than it has ever been, with numerous new issuers from both sides of the credit spectrum. The category includes low-income countries from sub-Saharan Africa and wealthy oil exporters from the Persian Gulf. A more diversified issuer base translates into less idiosyncratic risk and more active management opportunities.\\nSovereign resilience\\nAnother strength of this asset class is the resilience of sovereign issuers. Emerging markets countries have access to pools of financing from multilateral and bilateral lenders not available to private issuers. They also can fund domestically and raise additional revenues through taxes.\\nThis certainly does not make emerging markets investments risk-free, and defaults do happen, but the incentive to pay the debt is very high. In fact, recovery rates after default are often higher than for corporate issuers because countries do not simply disappear as a company may. Once a recovery is in place, returns from emerging markets debt can be very significant as longer bond maturities can sustain price appreciation and countries strive to improve their credit fundamentals.\\nWhy emerging markets now?\\nThe specific case for emerging markets debt comes down to valuations and improving technical factors, while fundamentals are mixed. Many emerging markets issuers will continue to benefit from higher commodity prices, but some are exposed to higher import costs for food and fuel. Government revenues have been strong, but higher imported inflation is increasing costs for domestic borrowing as costs for external borrowing have risen.\\nFinancial markets have already factored current fundamental risks into prices. As of June 30, the J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Global Bond Index Diversified yield stood at 8.57%. For comparison, this yield just touched 8% during the peak of the COVID liquidity crisis in March of 2020, and the last time we saw these levels was in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The more than 22% drawdown since the middle of September 20211 already exceeds the worst drop in 2020 and is within 5% of the peak drawdown in 2008.\\nEmerging markets debt is further along in its adjustment. Triggered by early signs of global monetary tightening, the emerging markets sell-off began in the fourth quarter of 2021, much earlier than in the sell-off in the broader credit market. That's one reason we believe emerging markets debt is closer to its bottom and better positioned for recovery than other asset classes. The rapid selloff in spreads and global interest rates has resulted in historically low dollar prices for emerging markets bonds. While this mostly supports distressed issuers that may be forced to restructure (minimizing any loss given default), it should also result in tighter spreads for healthy credits, given the lower dollar amount investors have to put at risk for each bond purchased.\\nTechnical factors are improving. Weaker emerging markets issuers (over 20% of the market) are currently locked out of market access and will need to fund through alternative means. Another 20% of the market consists of wealthy oil exporters with very low funding needs due to high oil revenues. As a result, we expect to see negative net issuance this year, offsetting the impact of fund outflows. While emerging markets funds (along with other fixed income products) continue to see outflows, those outflows are relatively contained as a percentage of assets under management. Given high cash levels in emerging markets funds, any stabilization or reversal in flows could lead to a rapid repricing higher.\\nBottom line, emerging markets fixed income is attractive\\nWhile it's always hard to pick the exact bottom, we feel comfortable about the outlook for emerging markets debt returns for 12 to 18 months. We're now positioned constructively in our emerging markets portfolios and encourage you to consider increasing allocations to emerging markets debt in your clients' portfolios.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'An advisor whose client base has one investment goal, one investment time horizon, and one risk profile is an advisor with one client. The reality is that your clients\\' situations can differ across dozens of dimensions. Volatile market and economic conditions further complicate investment planning.\\nFor that reason, Vanguard offers a variety of multiasset portfolio solutions that allow you to customize your clients\\' investments to varying degrees, giving you more time to spend building relationships and growing your business.\\nBehind those solutions is a portfolio construction framework that is innovative and consistent, informing methodologies and investment solutions that are constantly monitored to ensure alignment with their objectives.\\nThe guiding philosophy behind our framework\\nVanguard\\'s portfolio construction framework begins with four core principles for investment success, all integral to productive advisory relationships.\\nThose tenets map directly to the elements of our framework, as shown below in Figure 1, below, which in turn are operationalized in the investment solutions available to you and your clients. The framework is market-tested, repeatable, and supported by proprietary internal quantitative models such as the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM) and the Vanguard Asset Allocation Model (VAAM), which enable customization of portfolios in a scalable and internally consistent manner across Vanguard multiasset solutions.\\nVanguard\\'s investment principles\\nFigure 1.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nMapping our principles to your practice\\n\\nYour work with clients to define clear and appropriate goals is the first step toward investment success through portfolio construction. Broader financial goals such as wealth-building or achieving a certain portfolio income are the focus of our framework and process.\\nBalance refers to the importance we place on diversification in avoiding uncompensated portfolio risk, to help you set clients\\' expectations and avoid performance \"surprise\" conversations. A rigorous quantification of investment risks for all asset classes and investment strategies is fundamental to our framework, and manifests in asset return forecasts and simulation models such as VCMM.\\nOur focus on cost goes right to you clients\\' bottom line, as we seek to minimize investment fees and other expenses that can compound over time and eat into returns. Our framework can account for more advanced cost aspects such as taxes, trading expenses, and the impact of liquidity in asset prices.\\nFinally, your coaching of client discipline centers on maintaining a long-term perspective and avoiding emotional reactions, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Accounting for various degrees of risk tolerance in our portfolio construction models can help you keep clients on plan through periods of market volatility.\\n\\nPowering the portfolios: Vanguard\\'s quantitative tools\\nVCMM: Asset return expectations\\nOptimizing clients\\' portfolios using asset return forecasts (or capital market assumptions) can help align performance or volatility expectations with a portfolio\\'s stated objectives. That\\'s why these forecasts are an explicit input in our asset allocation process. A simple asset allocation approach, considering no more than two or three asset classes, may yield very reasonable portfolios. VCMM is our proprietary statistical engine for optimizing more complex portfolios with numerous asset and sub-asset classes and multiple estimates for average returns, volatilities, and their correlations. Asset return distributions, not just asset return forecasts, are the main output from the VCMM and the key input in portfolio construction.\\nImportant features of the VCMM algorithm include:\\n\\nA probabilistic or distributional framework.\\nReliance on key economic and market valuation forecasting signals with a better track record over medium- and long-term horizons. Short-term forecasting is extremely difficult and very inaccurate.\\nConsideration of initial conditions: Over the medium term, expected returns depend on initial valuations such as price/earnings ratios and interest rate levels.\\nReliance on forward-looking equilibrium assumptions for certain economic or market drivers, such as long-run inflation, productivity growth, currency trends, and central bank neutral policy rates. The VCMM assumptions are inputs from Vanguard\\'s Global Economics Team.\\nAllowance for nonnormal distribution, featuring a higher probability of tail events than a normal distribution would suggest.\\n\\nVAAM: Model-based portfolio construction\\nAs you know, an investor\\'s financial goals involve the type of financial goal, the assets to be considered, the investment horizon, asset return expectations, and the investor\\'s appetite for financial risk.\\nVAAM, our asset allocation engine, accounts for these using a utility-driven representation of investor outcomes to maximize investors chances of achieving their financial goals, conditional on their risk tolerance.\\nUtility functions are mathematical representations of an investor\\'s attitude toward investment risk. They capture the trade-off any investor faces in balancing the desire for higher portfolio returns against increased risk.\\nVAAM-based portfolio construction process\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nA range of solutions to help meet client\\'s needs\\nOur portfolio construction framework is the underpinning of all of our model portfolio solutions. Our total return strategic model portfolios all take a market-capitalization approach, using a variety of benchmarks and Vanguard ETFs® to offer well-diversified broad exposure at low cost. These are complemented by market-cap model portfolios that emphasize tax efficiency and that seek to generate income. All are available with a range of stock and bond allocations to help address individual client needs.\\nThese solutions provide market-like returns with little potential for outperformance, but little risk of underperformance either. Their simplicity, no-surprises approach, and low fiduciary risk make them a great starting place for many investors with general wealth accumulation goals, and their long-term perspective seeks to provide a low-volatility, consistent approach to your clients.\\nCustom model portfolios, which seek to outperform the broad public benchmarks, albeit with additional risk, are available to support more specific investor needs and preferences.\\nThese include (any combination of):\\nPortfolios with risk factor tilts. For clients who may benefit from overweighting sub-asset classes such as value equities or international fixed income.\\nESG portfolios. Portfolios that emphasize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations.\\nDirect-index portfolios. These offer personalized index construction using any appropriate combination of tax-loss harvesting strategies, highly personalized ESG filters, or tailored factor investing.\\nUsing solutions like these to incorporate the Vanguard portfolio construction framework in your practice can help you provide a customized approach to client outcomes, while positioning you to reap the benefits of scale and consistency within your portfolio management process.\\n\\n\\n\\nCompare any two portfolios in seconds\\nUse our free Portfolio Manager tool to create hypothetical client portfolios and evaluate their potential response to current market conditions. Analyze hypothetical performance and risk statistics, compare two portfolios side-by-side, and more.Portfolio Manager\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or ETF Shares, contact your financial advisor to obtain a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus.

As a result, the companies deemed eligible by the index/data provider may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics. The evaluation of companies for ESG screening or integration is dependent on the timely and accurate reporting of ESG data by the companies. Successful application of the screens will depend on the index provider’s proper identification and analysis of ESG data.

       "  'content': 'Rising inflation has unleashed waves of selling in public markets, creating the need—or opportunity—for ETF-centric advisors to make time-sensitive portfolio adjustments that aim to improve after-tax returns and that are in line with clients\\' estimated capital gains profile and personal tax situation.\\nFor advisors exploring such adjustments given recent market volatility, or specifically looking to take advantage of tax-loss harvesting (TLH) trades, we walk you through below how to approach or organize such trades, which can be large and complicated.\\nBroad market stock indexes lost more than 14% year to date through May, and some indexes, such as those that follow technology stocks, have declined more than 20%. Often when stock prices fall, bond prices rise, but as economic data show continued high inflation and the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to confront it, we’ve even seen the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index fall more than 9% this year.1\\nBroad market pullbacks in 2022 have affected stocks and bonds alike\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nNote: Index data as of May 31, 2022.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThis presents a meaningful potential opportunity to harvest tax losses in both the stock and bond markets. So let\\'s explore that possibility and consider some best practices to employ, with particular focus on the bond market.\\nTLH with bond ETFs\\nFor those less familiar with tax-loss harvesting, TLH is the strategy of selling securities at a loss, which offsets capital gains and reduces one\\'s tax liability. Given the transparency and tradability of ETFs, which were first developed in the early 1990s, executing TLH trades at scale has probably never been as feasible as it is now using ETFs—even bond ETFs.\\nFor advisors committed to a TLH strategy after analyzing the mix of their clients\\' capital gains, clients\\' personal tax situations, and the market outlook, let\\'s zoom in on some more specific trading considerations. Because TLH trades can be relatively large, they need to be planned carefully to optimize execution quality.\\nSetting the stage\\nFor ETF investors, TLH often results in the sale of an ETF accompanied by the simultaneous purchase of a similar but not substantially identical ETF. The goal is to harvest the loss in the original ETF investment, adhere to the wash-sale rule, and provide similar investment exposure after the TLH trading is completed.2\\nAlso, while bond market volumes in 2022 have been well above normal, liquidity in bond ETFs remains plentiful. And trading spreads on fixed income ETFs in general, while wider when markets are volatile than when they are steady, remain narrower than spreads on the individual bonds in those ETFs.\\nVanguard bond ETF trading volumes and spreads in the past year\\nNote: Data cover June 2021 through May 2022.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nIt\\'s all in the planning\\nAs we emphasized in our previous article, As ETFs rise, it\\'s time to hone your ETF trading strategies, large trades can be quite complex and, if mishandled, can create negative consequences for advisors and client portfolios. That\\'s why careful planning, which can improve execution and limit transaction costs, is paramount each time you approach a relatively large trade.\\nTLH trades can often be large and require what we call \"high-touch\" trades.3 We recommend using high-touch trades if the trade size exceeds both 5% of average daily trading volume and the quoted size available on the bid/offer.\\nIf that\\'s the case, consider whether your order is large enough to result in the creation or redemption of ETF shares, and consider working with your custodian\\'s block trading desk.4 If the order is relatively modest in size and you don\\'t need to work with your custodian\\'s block trading desk, you may want to consider a low-touch order such as a limit order or a marketable limit order. Marketable limit orders are ones priced for immediate execution.5\\nOne useful trading technique that could potentially make pursuing the same TLH opportunity across numerous client ETF portfolios more efficient is ETF order aggregation. In our experience, order aggregation can make sense for institutional clients and for advisors that are implementing TLH across numerous client accounts, if your firm\\'s technology can support it.\\nThe power of switch trades\\nMoreover, if the TLH trade is large enough and could result in the creation and redemption of ETF shares, a “switch trade” strategy might be a good idea. A switch trade involves working with your custodian’s block desk to put multiple market makers in competition for the packaged ETF trade, meaning both the selling and the buying of the ETF shares in question. In other words, the sell order and buy order are done at the same time instead of being handled as two separate risk trades.\\nIf the ETF being sold (ETF A) has a high correlation to the ETF being purchased (ETF B), a market maker can redeem ETF A and use the basket of securities they receive to create ETF B.\\nThe switch trade results in the market maker having fewer transaction costs, which get passed through in the form of better execution quality for end-clients.\\nAnd the bigger the trade, the more a switch trade strategy makes sense.\\nVanguard\\'s ETF Capital Markets team is available to assist with trading and execution throughout the decision-making process, increasing the likelihood of successful outcomes. If you\\'d like to discuss any of the topics in this article on behalf of your practice and clients, consider reaching out to our Capital Markets Desk.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Year to date through May 31, 2022, the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index returned –14.19%, the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index returned –20.98%, and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index returned –9.05%.\\n2 The wash-sale rule prohibits selling an investment at a loss and replacing it with the same or a \"substantially identical\" investment 30 days before or after the sale. If you have a wash sale, the IRS prohibits writing off the investment loss.\\n3 High-touch orders come in different forms. Risk trades are done with a market maker at a negotiated price for a block of ETF shares, where the market maker commits capital to facilitate the client’s order immediately. Such trades generally occur at a slight premium or discount to the quoted spread (the National Best Bid/Offer) at the time of the trade. Algorithmic trades use automated algorithms to try to achieve specific outcomes. These are generally executed over a period of time and intended to minimize price impact in the market.\\n4 ETFs are created and redeemed in unit sizes. Generally, the minimum to facilitate a creation or redemption is 25,000 ETF shares, but creation unit size can vary by product.\\n5 Vanguard\\'s ETF Capital Markets Desk typically suggests that investors consider using limit orders or marketable limit orders to avoid any unexpected ETF executions. In our view, marketable limit orders may represent the best of both worlds in that executions are quick and include safeguards that market orders lack.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or ETF Shares, contact your financial advisor to obtain a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus.

       "  'content': '\"The first half of the year was a rough time for bond investors, with prices falling as yields climbed,\" said Matt Sheridan, senior investment consultant with Vanguard Portfolio Analytics and Consulting.\\nBond prices may not matter as much as your clients think they do\\n\"While swift bond price declines are upsetting to clients,\" Sheridan said, \"it\\'s important to remain focused on the long-term benefits of higher rates.\"\\nBond total returns have two main components: price return and return from income. Changes to interest rates cause these two components to move in opposite directions. Medium- to long-term investors should care more about bond total returns instead of the negative short-term impact on bond prices. In fact, as we show in the chart, the long-term performance of bond investments has come mostly from income return, not price return.\\nPrice return and total return for U.S. aggregate bonds\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nNotes: Monthly data are from December 31, 1999, to May 31, 2022. U.S. aggregate bonds are represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index in USD. All bond income is assumed to be reinvested. Income return is the reinvestment of coupons and compound interest on the reinvestment.\\nSource: Bloomberg.\\n\\nWhy bond bear markets are fundamentally different from stock bear markets\\nFor bond investors, the price return component’s effect on total return decreases as time extends. For stock investors, the price return component of total return is much more significant. \"The Lost Decade\" is a great example of this: From January 2000 through December 2009, the total annualized return for the S&P 500 was –0.95%, inclusive of the reinvestment of dividends. The negative price returns caused by the bear markets of 2000–2002 and 2007–2009 had an immense impact on long-term returns.\\nNow take the bond bear market of the 1970s, which was seen as a terrible time to have been invested in bonds as both inflation and nominal interest rates were soaring. But consider this: Long-term bond investors who reinvested their income returns, and remained patient as compounding took hold, nearly doubled their capital from 1976–1983. Over the longer term, bond total returns are driven much more by reinvestment of interest income and compounding than by price returns. \"Investors need to look beyond the immediate pain of losses appearing in their quarterly bond portfolio statements to the longer-term upside of rising interest rates,\" Sheridan said.\\nInterest income and reinvestment account for the largest portion of total return in bond funds\\nBond investing in the 1970s and early 1980s\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nNotes: For this example, we assume that an investor fully funded a $100,000 investment in the Barclay\\'s Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (now Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index) on January 1, 1976. We do not account for any expenses or taxes. Interest-on-interest return is calculated as the remainder after subtracting both income and capital returns from the total return.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations based on capital, income, and total return data reported by Barclay\\'s Capital.\\n\\nBond math holds up even during fixed income shocks\\nConsider short-term Treasuries: interest-rate-sensitive securities whose total returns are extremely sensitive to central bank policy changes. As interest rates on the short end of the Treasury curve have risen due to expectations of further Federal Reserve policy adjustments, so too has the weighted average yield to maturity for funds that invest in these securities. That provides a better foundation to help weather further rate shocks as starting yields are now much higher. Even if rates were to rise an additional 200 basis points (bps) from here, you would now recoup any lost principal within a year and then benefit from higher yields moving forward—ultimately increasing the long-term value of your bond portfolios (see chart).\\nThat means the time to recoup your capital from an interest rate shock depends on your starting yield. A 200 bp rate shock from a 50 bp starting yield will take longer to break even when compared to a 200 bp rate shock from a 250 bp starting yield.\\n\"The bottom line is that as rates move higher, bonds are more attractive, not less,\" Sheridan said.\\nThe silver lining in rising rates\\nHypothetical impact of changes in interest rates\\nNotes: This hypothetical example begins with a portfolio value of $100,000 and does not represent the return on any particular investment. \"No change\" yields are based on a starting yield of 3%. For simplicity, duration was assumed to remain at two years, but in practice, as yields change, duration also changes. Such a dramatic change in yields, as this example assumes, would likely constitute a rather significant adjustment to a portfolio\\'s weighted average duration. For purposes of illustration, we assumed no change to yields in subsequent years. Yields are not guaranteed.\\nSource: Vanguard.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'A new Vanguard research paper highlights the fact that almost double the projected number of Americans retired during the pandemic. Some may be forced to reenter the workforce as they have not accumulated enough assets to last through retirement. The authors discuss their ongoing research to find viable solutions to address the retirement income gap, which may only get wider.\\n\\xa0\\n\"During the pandemic, some 1.6 million older workers left the labor force earlier than expected,\" said Andrew S. Clarke, principal of Vanguard Investment Strategy Group\\'s retirement team and one of three authors of The Great Retirement? Or the Great Sabbatical?\\n\"For those in the top deciles in wealth, early retirement is manageable. For those with less assets, it\\'s not. Although the latter represent a small portion of the population, their pandemic behavior raises provocative questions about American workers\\' prospects of financing life after labor.\"\\nHow can those who retired earlier than expected address asset shortfalls during retirement?\\nThis question takes on greater urgency in the current environment, said Fu Tan, investment research analyst and coauthor of the paper. \"Our research drew on data through 2021. Obviously, the drop in market value of retirement assets and spiking inflation since then will make it more pressing for some earlier-than-expected retirees to return to work. Our analysis demonstrates that a few extra years of employment can greatly enhance retirement security.\"\\nBut what about those who can\\'t return to work or may still not have enough income?\\nThere are several additional options to consider.\\nModifying the replacement ratio\\nOne of the most common rules of thumb regarding retirement income is the replacement ratio—the amount of preretirement income that needs to be replaced in retirement.\\nVanguard\\'s research assumes a target replacement ratio of 79%, consistent with assumptions in many research models. But retirees have some flexibility in how much of their preretirement income to replace.\\n\"Model stress tests and empirical research suggest a wide range of replacement ratios,\" Tan said. \"If an expected replacement ratio of 80% includes significant discretionary spending, those whose assets look a little lean might be able to finance retirement with a lower replacement ratio.\"\\nAnother guideline that can be reevaluated, particularly in this market environment, is the 4% withdrawal rate. Vanguard\\'s research suggests a rate of about 3% is a more realistic figure given current inflation and muted expected returns for both stocks and bonds, Clarke said.\\n\"It\\'s important to keep in mind that, ultimately, these are all just rules of thumb,\" Clarke said. \"There are too many variables with market conditions and each individual\\'s circumstances to reduce a solution to one number for everyone.\"\\nThese rules also ignore another potential source of income for retirees—the four walls that surround them.\\nUntapped equity: The home\\nAbout 80% of Americans 65 and older are homeowners, and housing wealth accounts for 40% of their net worth. Preliminary Vanguard research spotlights one strategy these retirees have used to extract equity from their homes.\\n\"We find that many homeowners 60 and older tap into housing wealth by moving to a cheaper place,\" Clarke said. \"They bolster their retirement security with such moves in two ways. First, by moving to a new location with a lower house price, they seamlessly liquidate some of their housing wealth. Second, they also benefit from settling in a new location with a lower cost of living.\"\\nMore guidance needed\\nThe onus should not be just on the individual to figure this out.\\n\"What\\'s clear is that the picture has gotten more complex for all, whether individual investors, advisors, consultants, or plan sponsors,\" Clarke said. \"There\\'s no consensus even among experts on next best steps, so we shouldn\\'t expect the average person to judge their best route to a secure retirement.\\n\"Advisors may want to check in with their clients to see if their goals and circumstances have changed and provide counsel. Plan sponsors might want to reevaluate their participant education and support programs to ensure their employees remain on track to meet retirement goals. Plan providers and researchers must take into account how the shifting dynamics in the financial and labor markets affect the assumptions used in their models. At Vanguard, we\\'re doing research and modeling that can set the most appropriate goalposts in our ever-changing environment.\"'},\n",

       "  'content': 'At the start of the year, we expected global economies to continue to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic but at a more modest pace than in 2021. While that holds true, the pace of change in macroeconomic fundamentals such as inflation, growth, and monetary policy has failed to live up to expectations.\\nLabor and supply-chain constraints were already fueling inflation before the year began, but Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine and China\\'s zero-COVID policy exacerbated the situation. Central banks have been forced to play catchup in the fight against inflation, ratcheting up interest rates more rapidly and possibly higher than previously expected. But those actions risk cooling economies to the point that they enter recession.\\n\"Global economic growth will likely stay positive this year, but some economies are flirting with recession, if not this year, then in 2023,\" said Andrew Patterson, Vanguard senior international economist.\\nCompared with the start of the year, Vanguard has downgraded its 2022 GDP growth forecasts for all the major regions, increased its inflation forecasts, and become more hawkish about monetary policy.\\nExpected 10-year asset-class returns have risen\\nStock and bond markets have been hit hard so far in 2022.

We expect the equivalent of 12 to 14 rate hikes of 25 basis points for the full year, with the target federal funds rates landing in the 3.25%–3.75% range by year-end. We expect a terminal rate of at least 4% in 2023—higher than what we consider to be the neutral rate (2.5%) and above what\\'s currently being priced into the market. (The neutral rate is the theoretical rate at which monetary policy neither stimulates nor restricts an economy.)\\nWe have downgraded expected U.S. GDP growth from about 3.5% at the start of the year to about 1.5%. The factors that led to our downgrade will likely continue through 2022—namely, tightening financial conditions, wages not keeping up with inflation, and lack of demand for U.S. exports. Labor market trends are likely to keep downward pressure on the unemployment rate through year-end, though increases in 2023 are likely as the impacts of Fed policy and slowing demand take hold. We assess the probability of recession at about 25% over the next 12 months and 65% over 24 months. We believe that a period of high inflation and stagnating growth is more likely than an economic \"soft landing\" of growth and unemployment rates around or above longer-term equilibrium levels (about 2% for growth and 4% for unemployment).\\nEuro area\\nIn the euro area, headline inflation driven by high energy prices may spike to above 10% in the third quarter. Inflation has become widespread, spurring the European Central Bank into what it expects will be a \"sustained path\" of interest rate increases. In September, rates will likely be out of negative territory for the first time in a decade. We forecast economic growth to be about 2% to 3% for the full year. However, Europe\\'s dependence on Russian natural gas and the challenges of managing monetary policy for 19 countries put the euro area at a higher risk of recession than the United States in the next 12 months. A complete cutoff from Russian gas would likely lead to rationing and recession. We assess the probability of recession around 50% over 12 months and 60% over 24 months.\\nChina\\nChina will fall far short of policymakers\\' growth target of about 5.5%, given that it\\'s a challenge to achieve all three of their goals: the growth target, financial stability, and a zero-COVID policy. (The latter affects not just China\\'s economy, but the global economy as well.) We believe the actual 2022 GDP growth rate will be just above 3%, far below China\\'s pace for many years. Given China\\'s zero-COVID policy, additional outbreaks resulting in renewed lockdowns could further detract from growth. That said, recession is unlikely, with probability at 30% over 12 months and 35% over 24 months.\\nEmerging markets\\nWe recently downgraded our forecast for full-year 2022 growth in emerging markets, from about 5.5% at the start of the year to about 3%. Emerging markets continue to face headwinds from slowing growth in the United States, the euro area, and China, as well as from developed markets\\' central bank tightening and from domestic and global inflation. Although higher commodities prices do benefit some emerging economies, they\\'re a negative in the aggregate.\\nProbability of recession for select regions\\nSource: Vanguard, as of July 7, 2022.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nVanguard forecasts as of June 30, 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEconomic growth\\nHeadline inflation\\nMonetary policy\\nUnemployment rate\\n\\n\\nUnited States\\n~1.5%\\n7%–7.5%\\n3.25%–3.75%\\n3%–3.5%\\n\\n\\nCanada\\n~4%\\n~6.5%\\n~3%\\n~5.5%\\n\\n\\nMexico\\n~2%\\n~5%\\n8%–9%\\n~3.5%\\n\\n\\nEuro area\\n2%–3%\\n~8%–8.5%\\n0.5%–0.75%\\n~7%\\n\\n\\nUnited Kingdom\\n3.5%–4%\\n~10%\\n2.25%–2.5%\\n~4%\\n\\n\\nChina\\n~3%\\n<2.5%\\n2.75%\\n~5.5%\\n\\n\\nAustralia\\n3%–3.5%\\n~7%\\n~2.5%\\n~4%\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes: Forecasts evolve with new data, and our views will inevitably change. Growth is the change in annualized GDP year over year. Inflation is the headline consumer price index, which includes the volatile food and energy sectors. Monetary policy is our year-end projection for the central bank’s short-term interest rate target.\\nSource: Vanguard forecasts as of June 30, 2022.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIs inflation inevitable?\\nPersistent inflation has several economies, including the U.S., edging closer to recession. In this short video, Vanguard’s chief economist says four conditions need to be met to avoid that path.\\n\\nJoe Davis: Inflation is at generational highs, and many are concerned about the threat of recession. So, what\\'s Vanguard\\'s view?\\nOur own economic projections now indicate a greater than 50% probability of a recession occurring over the next 12 to 18 months, both in the United States and other developed markets, in particular Europe.\\nWhy the increased odds of recession? Well, now we have two forces pushing on inflation. The well-documented supply constraints of food and energy and other products leading to higher costs of living for many consumers and businesses. And the second force, which we have long documented—the tight labor market pushing up wage pressures, which also contribute to higher inflation for a number of products and services.\\nNow, greater than 50% odds are not 100%, and recession is not a foregone conclusion. So, what would it take for the U.S. economy and other markets to avoid a recession, a scenario that is not fully priced by the financial markets? Well, in my mind, there are four.\\nFor the Federal Reserve, respectfully, I would strongly urge moving short-term interest rates to 3% before the end of the summer. That would help tamp down inflation expectations, which have started to creep up given the recent experience of high inflation.\\nWe would need to see commodity prices fall further from here. Say, perhaps, oil below $100 a barrel— which, if that would occur, would fully offset the rise in food prices, which have also been material over the past 12 months for most consumers.\\nIf we would see inventories rebuild as they have been doing over the past several months, that would potentially provide some modest price relief, and that is critical to bring down headline inflation, which is north of 8.5%.\\nAnd then, finally, we need to see a little bit of luck on labor supply. And, indeed, we would need to see at least one million Americans more join the labor force over the summer. That would help better balance the strong demand for labor with the lack of supply. And that would provide still-heady wage growth, but perhaps at a slightly lower rate and yet still ahead of the rate of cost of living, should we see these three other conditions met.\\nSo, four conditions to avoid recession. And, unfortunately, I don\\'t view this as a multiple-choice exam, and in fact we would need to see all four met for the U.S. economy and other markets to avoid recession.\\nSo, bottom line: Soft landings, which is the goal of many central banks; soft landings are rare, and they\\'re rarer than recessions. And should the U.S. economy and other markets fall into recession, that will be unfortunate, although it will not spell the end of economic growth in the future.\\nThe path of the recovery, it has certainly narrowed. But the road isn\\'t blocked just yet, and in the months ahead we will have a better sense of where the economy unfolds.\\nImportant information:\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.\\n© 2022 The Vanguard Group, Inc.

       "  'content': 'John Galloway, Vanguard\\'s global head of investment stewardship, discusses how the team addresses environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks at portfolio companies that can affect long-term shareholder value.\\nHow does Vanguard define investment stewardship—and why is it important?\\nGalloway: Investment stewardship is the primary mechanism Vanguard uses to safeguard and promote the long-term value and investment returns of investors in our internally managed equity funds. Our program is guided by Vanguard\\'s core purpose: to take a stand for all investors, to treat them fairly, and to give them the best chance for investment success.\\nOur activities involve researching, identifying, and advocating for strong corporate governance practices that have a link to long-term shareholder value. We publicly advocate for the highest standards of corporate governance worldwide; we engage, or hold discussions, with company boards and management teams to share our expectations of best governance practices and understand how companies look after shareholder value; and ultimately, we vote proxies at shareholder meetings on behalf of the funds. It\\'s important to note that, by the nature of our index funds, we do not dictate company strategy or look to influence operational decisions. We\\'re focused squarely on questions of good governance and effective oversight of risks that could affect shareholder value.\\nWhat do you look for as hallmarks of good corporate governance?\\nGalloway: Vanguard\\'s Investment Stewardship program is grounded in four global principles of good governance. First, a company\\'s board of directors is responsible for representing our (and other shareholders\\') interests, so a board\\'s composition and effectiveness are critically important. Second, a board is responsible for oversight of company strategy and its material risks. Third, executive compensation should be linked to long-term performance and structured to incentivize a company\\'s outperformance of its peers. Fourth, shareholder rights—the ability of Vanguard and other investors to appropriately use our voice and our vote to safeguard and promote shareholder value—need to be robust and protected.\\nOur portfolio companies operate under different regulatory environments and region-specific norms that are evolving at different paces. It\\'s important that we understand those differences. Our four global principles are applied consistently, but regional nuances help inform our expectations and approach to specific companies.\\nHow much time is spent on environmental- or social-focused shareholder proposals versus the general governance practices of companies?\\nGalloway: Given that shareholder proposals that focus on different environmental or social issues are often the ones you read about in the news, many people may be surprised to learn that those constitute a very small percentage of the 170,000-odd individual proxy ballot items that the stewardship team votes on each year for the Vanguard funds. Over the last two decades, governance practices in developed markets have matured to a point where there is general agreement on the linkage between shareholder value and things like a well-composed board, effective and independent auditors, and executive compensation structures that are aligned to shareholder value. So the bulk of our time is spent engaging with companies and their boards about these governance practices. That said, we also dedicate resources to analyzing how boards oversee new and emerging material environmental and social matters that have the potential to enhance or detract from shareholder value over time.\\nEnvironmental and social shareholder proposals make up a small percentage of our voting activity\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow does investment stewardship differ for index funds versus actively managed funds?\\nGalloway: By design, an index fund holds the stocks in a market index and is an investor in those companies for as long as the companies are included in the benchmark index. An index fund does not have the option of divesting or buying more or less of a stock than is represented in the index, regardless of our own views of the strength of a company\\'s corporate governance practices. We view this as an opportunity, not a limitation, as we believe in the power of active engagement. We promote and safeguard value for index fund investors by engaging with company boards and leaders to share our perspectives on good governance practices. And when necessary, we use our vote to hold boards accountable for failures of risk oversight, or to encourage the adoption of shareholder proposals that we believe are in the best long-term interests of shareholders.\\nWe approach our engagements as ongoing conversations with companies over months and years. Our portfolio companies know we are not focused on the next quarter or year, but on long-term shareholder value that spans years and decades.\\nIn an actively managed fund, where a portfolio manager can buy or sell stocks in pursuit of outperforming a benchmark index, the investment stewardship levers of voting and engagement serve as additional ways for the manager to express perspectives to a company on behalf of fund investors.1\\nWhat global governance trends stood out over the last year?\\nGalloway: We saw continued focus on how companies are responding to climate change risk. Particularly in Europe and the U.K., but also in the U.S., these concerns took on some new flavors, such as companies adopting or receiving \"Say on Climate\" proposals that encourage companies to disclose climate-related risks, targets, and transition plans.\\nHeightened attention to risks associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, was another key trend. Investors continue to focus on how companies are ensuring that their board, management teams, and workforce reflect appropriate levels of diversity. We see more companies providing enhanced disclosures of their workforce diversity statistics, their strategy to address DEI-related risks, and progress on their efforts. Calls for third-party racial equity audits, or social justice audits, also gained prominence on the ballots of U.S. public companies during 2021, and we see that trend continuing in the early 2022 proxy season.\\nOne last trend I\\'ll highlight is the continued focus on company corporate political activity disclosures to help investors identify any risk of misalignment between a company\\'s stated long-term strategy and its lobbying activities.\\nLearn more about Vanguard Investment Stewardship, its global corporate governance principles, and its perspectives.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Investment stewardship for Vanguard’s externally managed active funds is carried out by those funds’ investment advisors, who integrate their stewardship principles with their investment processes.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.\\nDiversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Periodically, pundits declare the death of the 60% stock/40% bond portfolio. Their voices have grown louder lately, amid sharp declines in both stock and bond prices. But we\\'ve been here before. Based on history, balanced portfolios are apt to prove the naysayers wrong, again.\\nApproaching the midpoint of 2022, market, economic, and geopolitical conditions all appear fraught. Inflation is hitting 40-year highs, the Federal Reserve is sharply reversing monetary policy, the pandemic hasn\\'t gone away, and supply chain woes have been exacerbated by COVID-19 lockdowns in China and Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, with the latter putting the Western bloc the closest to a war footing in decades.\\nNot surprisingly, this perfect storm of negative market drivers has pushed stock and bond prices south in lockstep, impairing the normal diversification of risks in a balanced portfolio.\\nStock-bond diversification in historical context\\nBrief, simultaneous declines in stocks and bonds are not unusual, as our chart shows. Viewed monthly since early 1976, the nominal total returns of both U.S. stocks and investment-grade bonds have been negative nearly 15% of the time. That\\'s a month of joint declines every seven months or so, on average.\\nExtend the time horizon, however, and joint declines have struck less frequently. Over the last 46 years, investors never encountered a three-year span of losses in both asset classes.\\nHistorically, stock-bond diversification recovers within a few months\\nSource: Vanguard.\\nData reflect rolling period total returns for the periods shown and are based on underlying monthly total returns for the period from February 1976 through April 2022. The S&P 500 Index and the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index were used as proxies for stocks and bonds.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAs our chart shows, drawdowns in 60% stock/40% bond portfolios have occurred more regularly than simultaneous declines in stocks and bonds. This is due to the far-higher volatility of stocks and their greater weight in that asset mix. One-month total returns were negative one-third of the time over the last 46 years. The one-year returns of such portfolios were negative about 14% of the time, or once every seven years or so, on average.\\nBut we need to remind ourselves of the purpose of the traditional balanced portfolio.\\nThe math behind 60/40 portfolios\\nCatchy phrases like the \"death of 60/40\" are easy to remember, don\\'t require complex explanations, and may even seem to have a ring of truth in the difficult market environment we are in today. But such statements ignore basic facts of investing, focus on short-term performance, and create a dangerous disincentive for investors to remain disciplined about their long-term goals.\\nKeep in mind:\\n\\nThe goal of the 60/40 portfolio is to achieve long-term annualized returns of roughly 7%. This is meant to be achieved over time and on average, not each and every year. The annualized return of 60% U.S. stock and 40% U.S. bond portfolio from January 1, 1926, through December 31, 2021, was 8.8%.1 Going forward, the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM) projects the long-term average return to be around 7% for the 60/40 portfolio. Market volatility means diversified portfolio returns will always remain uneven, comprising periods of higher or lower—and, yes, even negative—returns. IMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the VCMM regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. Distribution of return outcomes from VCMM are derived from 10,000 simulations for each modeled asset class. Simulations as of April 30, 2022. Results from the model may vary with each use and over time. For more information, please see the Notes section.\\nThe average return we expect can still be achieved if periods of negative returns (like this year) follow periods of high returns. During the three previous years (2019–2021), a 60/40 portfolio delivered an annualized 14.3% return, so losses of up to –12% for all of 2022 would just bring the four-year annualized return to 7%, back in line with historical norms.1\\nOn the flip side, the math of average returns suggests that periods of negative returns must be followed by years with higher-than-average returns. Indeed, with the painful market adjustments year-to-date, the return outlook for the 60/40 portfolio has improved, not declined. Driven by lower equity valuations, the VCMM’s projected 10-year returns for U.S. stocks have increased by 1.3 percentage point since year-end 2021. And with higher interest rates, the VCMM’s projected 10-year U.S. bond returns have increased 1.6 percentage point from year-end 2021. Overall, the 10-year annualized average return outlook for the 60/40 is now higher by 1.3 percentage points than before the market adjustment.\\nMarket timing is extremely difficult even for professional investors and is doomed to fail as a portfolio strategy. Markets are incredibly efficient at quickly pricing unexpected news and shocks like the invasion of Ukraine or the accelerated and synchronized central bank response to global inflation. Chasing performance and reacting to headlines are doomed to fail as a timing strategy every time, since it amounts to buying high and selling low. Far from abandoning balanced portfolios, investors should keep their investment programs on track, adding to them in a disciplined way over time.\\n\\nNo magic in 60/40 but in balance and discipline\\nI\\'ve focused here on the 60/40 portfolio because of its touchstone status. In our view, 60/40 is a sound benchmark for an investment strategy designed to pursue moderate growth.\\nProminent and useful as a benchmark though it is, 60/40 is not magical. And talk of its demise is ultimately a distraction from the business of investing successfully over the long term.\\nThe broader, more important issue is the effectiveness of a diversified portfolio, balanced across asset classes, in keeping with the investor’s risk tolerance and time horizon. In that sense, \"60/40\" is a sort of shorthand for an investor’s strategic asset allocation, whatever the target mix.\\nFor some investors with a longer time horizon, the right strategic asset allocation mix may be more aggressive, 80/20 or even 90/10. For others, closer to retirement or more conservative-minded, 30/70 may do it. The suitability of alternative investments for a portfolio depends on the investor\\'s circumstances and preferences.\\nWhatever one calls a target asset mix and whatever one includes in the portfolio, successful investing over the long term demands perspective and long-term discipline. Stretches like the beginning of 2022—and some bear markets that have lasted much longer—test investors\\' patience.\\nThis isn\\'t the first time the 60/40 and the markets in general have faced difficulties—and it won\\'t be the last. Our models suggest that further economic travails lie ahead and that market returns will still be muted. But the 60/40 portfolio and its variations are not dead. Like the phoenix, the immortal bird of Greek mythology that regenerates from the ashes of its predecessor, the balanced portfolio will be reborn from the ashes of this market and continue rewarding those investors with the patience and discipline to stick with it.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Vanguard calculations using data from Standard & Poor’s, Dow Jones, MSCI, CRSP, Morningstar, and Bloomberg.

Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Despite recent volatility, Vanguard continues to view fixed income as a crucial diversifier for many investors. International bonds, in particular, historically have had low correlations with U.S. stocks and bonds. That\\'s one reason that more than three years ago, we introduced Vanguard Global Credit Bond Fund, an active fund that has delivered benchmark-beating returns since inception and is designed to be a building block for your clients\\' portfolios.\\nHow our Global Credit Bond Fund can serve your clients\\nVanguard Global Credit Bond Fund aims to provide a moderate and sustainable level of current income by investing in a diversified portfolio of global credit bonds. Like Vanguard Core Bond Fund and Vanguard Core Plus Bond Fund, which cover the U.S. bond market, Vanguard Global Credit Bond Fund offers:\\n\\nSingle-purchase exposure to a broad fixed income market.\\nLow costs.\\nSecurity selection that is true-to-label.\\nThe alpha (return that exceeds that of the benchmark) potential of active management.\\n\\nThe portfolio has only minimal exposure to non-dollar-denominated bonds, and any exposure to these bonds is fully hedged, enabling investors to be globally diversified without incurring the significant currency risk often involved in investing globally. Its holdings are largely made up of U.S. corporate, European corporate, and high-quality sovereign emerging markets bonds. The fund can also invest in below-investment-grade corporates and emerging markets securities when they\\'re attractive, but only to a limited extent to keep the portfolio high quality.\\nIts diversification and high-quality bias make it suited to fill a couple of roles in a portfolio:\\n\\nA core allocation within a fixed income portfolio.\\nA complementary holding to add greater diversification to a fixed income portfolio or provide a tilt toward the credit sector.\\n\\nThe bottom line—Relative performance\\nA disciplined approach to risk, coupled with Vanguard Fixed Income Group\\'s ability to choose instruments across regions, subsectors, and yield curves in the credit universe, has resulted in a strong track record for this fund.\\nFrom its inception on November 15, 2018, through March 31, 2022, the fund returned a cumulative 17.73% for Admiral™ Shares, outperforming both the 12.43% return of its benchmark index, the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Credit Index (USD Hedged), as well as the average return of 7.82% for its peer group.\\n\"That\\'s a meaningful degree of outperformance in fixed income given that yields across the globe are still near historical lows,\" said John Croke, head of active fixed income product management.Vanguard Global Credit Bond Fund has consistently outperformed its benchmark and peer-group average\\nAnnualized returns as of March 31, 2022\\n\\n\\n\\nFund name\\nInception\\nExpense ratio\\n1 year\\n3 years\\nSince fund inception\\n\\n\\nVanguard Global Credit Bond Fund Admiral Shares\\n11/15/2018\\n0.25%\\n–4.04%\\n3.53%\\n4.96%\\n\\n\\n\\nBloomberg Global Aggregate Credit Index (USD Hedged)\\n\\n01/16/2001\\n—\\n–4.90%\\n2.12%\\n3.54%\\n\\n\\nGlobal Income Funds Average\\n—\\n0.87%\\n–5.51%\\n1.22%\\n2.26%\\n\\n\\n\\nThe performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results.

The management team obviously didn\\'t anticipate the coronavirus pandemic, but its conservative positioning allowed for adding risk as the market sold off. That wasn\\'t the case for some of our competitors, who were carrying more risk ahead of the pandemic, chasing a few extra basis points of potential return despite elevated valuations.\\nHow the management team added value\\nNote: Data are for April 2019 through March 2022.\\nSources: Vanguard and Bloomberg.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOur management team reduced risk in early 2021 once bonds had rebounded from the initial COVID-19 sell-off and valuations seemed high—much like the beginning of 2020—before it added a little risk through emerging-markets bonds later in the year.\\nThat movement out of and into and risk drove the fund\\'s strong relative performance.\\nGlobal credit bond funds hedged in U.S. dollars have tended to show little correlation with U.S. stocks over the past 15 years, according to data from Morningstar, Inc.1 And they have experienced smaller drawdowns than U.S. credit bond funds over the same period.\\nAnd, of course, the fund benefits from Vanguard\\'s hallmark, low costs. With an expense ratio of 0.25%, the fund\\'s Admiral share class was ranked in the 98th percentile on an expense-ratio basis for global income funds as of December 31, 2021, according to Lipper, Inc., a Thomson Reuters company.

       "  'content': \"With rising interest rates and inflation dominating the headlines, are your clients considering a shift in their portfolio allocation strategy? You likely also have clients who are locked into a home bias, not realizing how much this lack of diversification can cost them over the long term. Is international investing worth a look? There are some excellent reasons to consider an allocation to investments outside of the U.S.\\nFinancial markets around the world change rapidly in response to news and events, and by avoiding international stocks your clients are excluding a large portion of the global opportunity set. In fact, international stocks, represent almost 44% of the global market—a figure too large to ignore.1\\nRecent extreme market volatility can afford you the chance to help clients redeploy their capital in order to help them achieve their long-term financial goals. Here are four reasons to embrace global investing.\\n\\nChanging market leadership\\n\\nThe rationale for diversification is clear—U.S. and international stocks often swap positions as performance leaders. What might the future hold as leaders potentially turn to laggards? Global diversification gives you a chance to participate in whatever region is outperforming at a given time.\\nHere you will see how stock market leadership has alternated in the past between the U.S. and international markets. Rather than choosing one region over another based on past performance, consider focusing on the long-term benefits of a global approach.\\nTrailing 12-month return differential between U.S. and non-U.S. stocks\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nNotes: U.S. equities are represented by MSCI USA Index; international equities are represented by MSCI All Country World Index ex USA.

While we believe the price/earnings ratios for stocks are some of the best indicators of future returns, we also recognize that you must take into account valuations from a fair-value standpoint, factoring in global economic and market changes.\\nBased on these valuations, the expected return outlook for non-U.S. stocks over the next 10 years is higher than that for U.S. stocks.\\nGlobal non-U.S. equity annualized returns\\n(in U.S. dollars)\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results.\\nDistribution of return outcomes from the VCMM are derived from 10,000 simulations for each modeled asset class.

Of course it's natural to be concerned about geopolitical risk, but having a mix of U.S. and international equities can actually reduce portfolio risk.\\nThe maximum volatility reduction benefit of adding an allocation to international equities occurs between the 20%–50% range.\\nChange in portfolio volatility when including non-U.S. stocks in a U.S. portfolio, 1970–2020\\nNotes: Non-U.S. equities are represented by MSCI World Index ex USA and U.S. stocks are represented by the MSCI USA Index from March 31, 1970, through March 31, 2020.

The index provider’s assessment of a company, based on the company’s level of involvement in a particular industry or the index provider’s own ESG criteria, may differ from that of other funds or of the advisor’s or an investor’s assessment of such company.\\xa0 As a result, the companies deemed eligible by the index provider may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics.\\xa0 The evaluation of companies for ESG screening or integration is dependent on the timely and accurate\\xa0 reporting of ESG data by the companies. Successful application of the screens will depend on the index provider’s proper identification and analysis of ESG data.\\nInvestors cannot invest directly in an index. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.\\nInvestments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk. These risks are especially high in emerging markets. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Prices of mid- and small-cap stocks often fluctuate more than those of large-company stocks.\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. VCMM results will vary with each use and over time.\\nThe VCMM projections are based on a statistical analysis of historical data. Future returns may behave differently from the historical patterns captured in the VCMM. More important, the VCMM may be underestimating extreme negative scenarios unobserved in the historical period on which the model estimation is based.\\nThe Vanguard Capital Markets Model is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguard’s primary investment research and advice teams. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes.

       "  'content': 'In the rapidly changing environment that has characterized 2022 so far, we have downgraded our forecasts for GDP growth for the United States and China and revised our views on inflation and monetary policy for the euro area. But we believe these economies will likely avoid a recession this year, and our forecast for Federal Reserve policy is unchanged.\\n\"We\"ll see slower growth going forward because of a myriad of factors,\" said Andrew Patterson, Vanguard senior international economist. \"But our views on macro fundamentals are changing in regard to magnitude, not in direction.\"\\nUnited States: Slower but continued growth\\nWe\\'ve revised our outlook for full-year U.S. GDP growth to roughly 2%, down from around 3.5% at the start of the year.1 Three factors that will likely persist through 2022 drive our downgrade:\\nFinancial conditions have tightened to a level that likely restricts growth. Most of the tightening has come through higher lending rates. Falling equity markets have also contributed. We believe conditions have tightened significantly more than what\\'s implied by the market\\'s current pricing of future federal funds rate increases. Hikes eventually might even go beyond the neutral policy rate (when the Fed\\'s key interest rate would neither stimulate nor restrict the economy), which we currently see as around 2.5%.\\nIncomes aren\\'t keeping pace with inflation, a drag on what have been solid consumer fundamentals. We believe that wage growth will remain elevated but will only catch up to levels of core inflation late in 2022, and will continue to lag headline inflation, which includes the effects of volatile food and energy prices.\\nThe foreign demand outlook has deteriorated. The war in Ukraine is hurting European economies, and persistent COVID-19 outbreaks have caused growth in China to fall well below trend. We expect U.S. net trade to be pressured as a result. A 1.5% U.S. GDP contraction in the first quarter was in no small part driven by a reduction in net trade, as exports declined and imports increased.2 The simple math of the unexpected first-quarter decline in U.S. GDP puts downward pressure on full-year GDP.\\n\"We\\'re tempering expectations about growth, but that doesn\\'t materially change our views about the labor market or inflation at this point,\" Patterson said. More moderate growth will keep the unemployment rate from falling below 3% in the near term, and high labor demand should normalize more rapidly. We continue to expect that inflation will remain elevated but falling, supported by healthy demand, a tight labor market, and supply constraints that will linger throughout the year. Persistently elevated energy prices have grown as an additional risk factor, and we will monitor that closely.\\n\"The growth rate also doesn\\'t change our view on Fed monetary policy for what remains of 2022,\" he added. Vanguard expects the federal funds rate to increase another 100 to 150 basis points (bps), on top of the 75 bps earlier in the year. The rate hikes will come alongside a reduction in the Fed\\'s balance sheet.\\nEurope: Spiking inflation means higher rate hikes\\nThe story is a bit different in the euro area.\\n\"Our European economists are anticipating more interest rate hikes in 2022 than originally forecasted,\" Patterson said. \"The European Central Bank (ECB) is now more focused on fighting inflation, which is spiking into double-digit territory on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\"\\nThe changing picture for Europe.\\nEurope is slowing down, but recession isn\\'t likely unless Russian natural gas imports end. Euro area growth will likely be around 2.5%, lower than Vanguard\\'s forecast of around 4% at the start of the year. Recession is not likely this calendar year unless there is a hard stop to Russian gas imports.\\nAnnualized headline CPI is tracking above 15% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Vanguard has increased its inflation forecast for the full year to an average of 7.5% to 8%, up from our earlier 6.5%–7% forecast. Spikes in prices for food and energy are the most acute drivers, but inflation has become broader across sectors, especially in services.\\nThe ECB has acknowledged the changing dynamics. Key officials have been signaling more openness to aggressive rate hikes.\\nWe now forecast 100 to 125 bps of rate hikes in 2022, higher than our previous forecast of 50 bps. As such, we expect the ECB\\'s key deposit rate to turn positive for the first time since 2011 and to end the year in a range of 0.5% to 0.75%.\\nWe expect the policy rate to be above neutral (around 1.5%) by the middle of next year and to reach 2.5% by year-end 2023. This is about 50 bps higher than what\\'s reflected in current bond market pricing.\\nChina: 2022 growth target is likely to be missed\\n\"We\\'re predicting a 2022 growth rate just above 3% for China, which is lower than consensus and considerably lower than the central government\\'s target of around 5.5%,\" Patterson said. \"Obviously that\\'s still a healthy growth rate, but for China, that will feel like a recession from what they\\'re used to.\"\\nThe factors driving the downgrade.\\nChina\\'s zero-COVID policy has had a significant impact. Economic indicators have been weaker than expected in the second quarter, driven by the COVID-19 lockdowns; this will weigh down the full-year forecast. However, we anticipate that May was the trough.\\nDon\\'t expect a repeat of the 2021 recovery. Although China should recover during the second half of 2022, it will not be anywhere close to the robust pace seen in the second half of last year. There are too many headwinds offsetting anticipated stimulus.\\nFuture COVID outbreaks can\\'t be discounted. More pressing is that China’s continuing zero-COVID policy will mean that any future outbreaks will dampen economic activity.\\nOur revised forecast for the full year is a downgrade from the 5% we anticipated at the start of the year. It\\'s also lower than consensus views that generally range from 4% to 5%.\\nImpact on global economy and Fed monetary policies\\nAlthough global recession is unlikely, things are in flux and the Federal Reserve will be watching indicators carefully in forming future monetary policy. The chart reflects Vanguard\\'s modeling on how aggressive the Fed would be in hiking short-term interest rates depending on various scenarios. For more information, see the Vanguard research paper Federal Monetary Policy: Is This Time Different? (PDF)\\nThe federal funds rate in select scenarios\\nNotes: This figure describes the Fed\\'s rate hike path under each scenario presented. The forecasts are obtained from Vanguard\\'s model estimates. A combination of model estimates and subjective analysis is used to estimate the forecasts\\' terminal rate and timing under each scenario.\\nSources: Adapted from Federal Monetary Policy: Is This Time Different? (PDF) Vanguard model estimates based on data from Refinitiv, Moody\\'s, and Bloomberg.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe Fed has to find a balance between reining in inflation and tempering the pressures of a tight labor market. Developments that weigh heavily on economic activity would likely cause the Fed to slow its pace of rate hikes.\\nLike the Fed, Vanguard will be closely monitoring this ever-changing situation.\\n\"We\\'re always revisiting our views in any economic environment, but the fact that we\\'re revising so many of our global perspectives now speaks to the uncertainty underlying today\\'s environment, given the risks surrounding geopolitics, policies, and supply chains,\" Patterson said.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nInsights on the current market environment\\nCheck out our market volatility hub for the latest updates for you and your clients.View our insights\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n1 Measured on a Q4/Q4 percent-change basis.\\n2 Imports are subtracted from GDP because they reflect goods produced outside the United States.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Vanguard International Growth Fund Admiral™ Shares (VWILX) has recently seen a reversal in fortune as near-term performance has felt the weight of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment.\\nWe recently caught up with portfolio managers Thomas Coutts and Lawrence Burns from Baillie Gifford Overseas Ltd., who manage 68% of Vanguard International Growth Fund. In these short, 2-minute videos you'll hear their thoughts on the recent market environment, maintaining their edge, and why they remain optimistic about the portfolio in the face of challenging, short-term performance.\\nYou'll also learn how Baillie Gifford views energy transition as a trend already benefitting the portfolio and something that they believe will be a key component moving forward.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do you stay optimistic when performance is challenging? What do you believe is the appropriate period to judge your performance?\\n\\nSo how do we maintain our optimism in the face of occasional, inevitable, sharp falls in the companies in which we invest?\\nI think optimism is a key component of what we do and something that deserves a bit of explanation. It is, I think, famously easier to sound clever by giving the pessimistic view, by pointing out why things will fail, why things don't work.\\nBut our optimism isn't frivolous or light. It's grounded in observation of human development over 250 years.\\xa0 If you look back to the period of human history since the Industrial Revolution, people's lives have gotten better and longer. Economies have grown. Societies have become more equal. And the driving force underpinning that is scientific progress. It's people searching for new and better ways of doing things and technology is developing, emerging, that allows the world to get better.\\nImagine you are in the work in the 2100s, look back to around the early 2020s and ask yourself, what was it that was happening that was really interesting around then?\\nAnd we see loads of things that are happening. New technological developments, a confluence of technologies emerging in computer science, in health care and biology, and in energy, that we think will drive radical new ways of the world working, of society, is developing. And that will provide the backdrop to good investment opportunities for us over the coming years.\\nThe second reason we are optimists, and deliberate optimists, comes down to the nature of financial markets, stock markets. Professor Hendrik Bessembinder at Arizona State has been foundational in helping us learn and think more about this aspect. And what Professor Bessembinder has shown is that long term stock market returns are driven by a very small number of outlier companies that generate extreme returns that are many, many times the level of return generated by the average company in the index.\\nSo we use that insight to search for exactly those companies that are benefiting from driving technological trends, and we aim to hold those companies for long enough that they will have a very positive impact on our clients’ portfolios. That takes me to the point of time horizon. What's the right period over which to judge what we're doing for our clients?\\nWe judge our own success over rolling five-year periods and we ask clients to do the same. That doesn't mean we ignore or are blind to the ups and downs along the way. But as long as those long-term trends that we're investing in are intact, as long as companies are doing well operationally, then we will be happy to continue owning those businesses in our clients’ portfolios in the confidence that will deliver good, long-term returns for our clients.\\n\\xa0\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds visit advisors.vanguard.com or call 800-997-2798 to obtain a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus.

What about a possible China/Taiwan conflict?\\n\\nAs a fundamental manager, how do you weigh market events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? \\nSo in terms of market events and geopolitical events, I think two things really matter in trying to weigh these up, what they mean. The first is to approach them with genuine humility. These events can often be very, very hard to predict ahead of time and to have genuine insight around. Take the Russian invasion of Ukraine, for example. Most Russian political experts claim that there was no real risk of invasion, and sadly, they were wrong.\\nThe way we deal with this [with] humility is by trying to build out multiple scenarios of what might happen to our portfolio and its companies. Not just what, but we think what one scenario we think is the most likely, and that I think is one way of protecting us against overconfidence, as some of these events and thinking through the implications. The other element is being resolutely long-term.\\nWhen these events happen, you get 24-hour news streams. You get news updates and insights or alleged insights, every hour coming through. And you have stock market prices that are incredibly volatile, creating pressures on the financial markets. And rather than sticking to a long-term time horizon, market horizons tend to contract during these periods. Time horizons become more like five days than five years.\\nSo I think we have a real advantage in being able to continue to think about these events through a five-year lens, not a five-day lens. And that becomes really important. What we’re trying to do when we revisit all scenarios in light of new information is [determine] how and to what extent does this really change the long-term structural trends we're investing in?\\nDoes it make the adoptions of electric vehicles materially less likely? Does it disrupt the adoption of online services, of online retail, of the semiconductor industry in the very long term? And moving onto the specifics of the examples like the Ukraine conflict; one thing that we think is an interesting second order effect is that actually we've been big believers in the energy transition. With the rising price of fossil fuels, the attractions of an electric vehicle from Tesla, or a wind turbine from Vestas, actually look higher.\\nWhat about a possible China/Taiwan conflict?\\nThe other [thing], when we get asked about a lot is the potential for conflict between China and Taiwan. There is obviously a risk there on a multi-decade view. I think the way we try to deal with that is, again, through scenario analysis. But it's also through making sure that if there are risks from certain geopolitical events, that we're compensated by the potential upside if those events don't occur, and we're not losing out on that upside.\\nTencent, over the last ten years has returned over ten times for our clients, and it's those sort of outlier returns that we're really seeking that more than compensate for any risks that are involved in that investing. And it's balancing those two that really matter over the long term.\\n\\xa0\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds visit advisors.vanguard.com or call 800-997-2798 to obtain a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus.

       "  'content': 'The advent of fourth-generation (4G) wireless mobile networks enabled a lot of value creation, but most was captured by adjacent technology and digital media companies rather than the wireless network operators themselves.\\nAs fifth-generation (5G) networks roll out in the U.S. this year, we are likely to see a continuation of those trends.\\nAs fixed income investors, we are cautious about technology and digital media companies. Although they may well continue to capture most of the value from 5G, their debt already tends to be high-quality and is trading at high valuations. We see more value in wireless telecoms and cell tower operators; their credit profiles should improve as carriers expand 5G coverage and monetize this service.\\n\\nLessons learned from 4G\\nIt has been 11 years since Verizon rolled out the world\\'s first large-scale 4G wireless network.\\n4G networks brought about a tremendous amount of change. Social media and video consumption migrated to mobile, and gig economy platforms emerged, all with tremendous social, political, and investment implications.\\n4G networks enabled value creation, but, as the chart illustrates, wireless carriers and infrastructure manufacturers captured comparatively little of that value. Other parts of the wireless value chain, including semiconductors, handsets, and especially mobile content, received the lion\\'s share.\\nStock market increases in the 4G era for parts of the wireless value chain\\nNote: Data are year-end figures from 2010 through 2021.\\nSources: S&P Capital IQ and Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nEmerging themes in U.S. 5G\\nAs 5G lights up across the U.S., we have been weighing whether this generation of wireless networks will be as significant as the former and what the investment implications could be.\\nHere are some of the themes we see materializing:\\n\\n5G has kicked off a generational investment cycle in fiber, cell towers, network infrastructure, and data center capacity.\\nHigher speeds will create new market opportunities for mobile content, such as cloud gaming, augmented reality, and embedded artificial intelligence.\\nThis will grow new markets for hardware (such as wearables), drive higher semiconductor content in devices, and spur large investments in semiconductor manufacturing capacity, especially in the west.\\n5G fixed wireless broadband will drive more competition and consumer choice in residential broadband markets.\\n\\nAs in the last cycle, wireless carriers likely won\\'t capture much of the value from 5G networks.\\nWireless markets were competitive during the 4G era, and we expect them to become increasingly so because of the blurring of distinctions between wireless and cable providers. Wireless will increasingly compete with cable for home broadband service, especially in underserved areas.\\n5G makes it more feasible for governments to pursue rural broadband goals through subsidies. These subsidies will boost growth opportunities for wireless but may come at the expense of greater regulatory oversight and lower long-term margins.\\nCautious on tech and digital media\\nTechnology and digital content will continue to capture most of the value from 5G. However, we don\\'t think this implies opportunities for credit investors, for a number of reasons. These high-quality sectors already trade at elevated valuations, leading to an asymmetric risk-return profile (that is, limited upside and comparatively greater downside risk).\\nTech companies may use their fortress balance sheets to pursue new market opportunities through mergers and acquisitions (M&A), to the detriment of creditors. The recently announced Oracle-Cerner transaction is a good example.\\n5G is contributing to high demand for semiconductors today, but we are concerned that the massive supply response will overshoot demand and lead to an inventory-led correction.\\nToday\\'s dominant technology companies won\\'t necessarily be the winners in 5G applications. Asian markets have a head start and will be more competitive during this cycle.\\nRegulatory scrutiny is elevated. In the 5G era, tech incumbents will have less latitude to buy rising threats (such as Facebook/Instagram and Alphabet/YouTube).\\nIf regulatory curbs, global competition, and excess capacity slow growth, firms may resort to using their balance sheets to drive earnings-per-share growth, which would entail moving down in credit quality.\\nBullish on wireless networks and cell tower operators\\nWe see better fixed income value in wireless telecoms, such as Verizon and T-Mobile US, and towers, including Crown Castle and American Tower. Driven by M&A, the U.S. wireless sector dropped in credit quality during the 4G era. \"In the U.S., wireless telecoms migrated from single-A to triple-B credit ratings,\" said Scott Miles, senior credit analyst. \"That wasn\\'t a great outcome for fixed income investors, but, as a result, they offer more value today.\" Additionally, North American wireless networks have invested heavily recently in capital equipment and wireless spectrum. Balance sheets are stretched, but we expect credit profiles to improve as carriers expand 5G coverage and monetize this service. Carriers should use the current inflationary environment to push up pricing while touting increased network capability.\\nWireless earnings growth should shift from low single digits today to mid-single digits or better, accelerating the recovery of credit profiles.\\nAlthough the mobile market is saturated, we see major growth opportunities opening for fixed wireless. The drivers will be population growth, pricing, and fixed wireless expansion.\\nRegulatory oversight will increase as wireless networks displace landlines in some underserved areas, limiting margin growth but also suppressing volatility.\\nIn Europe, expect a slow 5G rollout, greater competition, and limited revenue growth\\nThe themes we see emerging with 5G in Europe are similar to those in the U.S., with some noteworthy differences and nuances:\\nThe European telecom market is more fragmented, with many more operators than in the U.S., where three large, nationwide players dominate. This leads to an intensely competitive market environment, which in turn means revenue growth is likely to be anemic, with limited near-term catalysts for improvement.\\nThe pandemic has highlighted the need for governments, companies, and consumers to have robust broadband connectivity. This is a political priority, and the European Commission has laid out ambitious targets for 5G rollout. These include ensuring uninterrupted 5G coverage in urban areas and along main transport routes by 2025. In March 2021, the commission extended the objective to include universal 5G coverage in all populated areas by 2030.\\nThe rollout of fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) has been very fragmented in Europe, and countries including the U.K. and Germany need to make significant investments to catch up. Investment spend is likely to focus on FTTH in the near term before gradually shifting to 5G. After a period of significant acquisition activity, telecoms are facing a balancing act to keep leverage in check while investing in network expansion. Consequently, we expect Europe to roll out 5G more slowly than the U.S. and developed Asia.\\n\"The credit profiles in the European telecom sector should hold fairly steady, with network investment remaining elevated in the short-to-medium term and revenue and earnings growth likely to be modest,\" said Andreas Nagstrup, a European credit analyst based in London. \"There are, however, differences among telecom credits even in this somewhat challenging environment, which gives active managers scope to add value.\"\\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, emerging trends look set to support both the equity and credit markets\\nUnlike the U.S. and Europe, where there is a degree of homogeneity, Asia-Pacific is a highly diverse region, and the pace of 5G rollout varies markedly amid different market structures and regulatory environments. South Korea was first to roll out 5G in April 2019, followed closely by Australia, China, and Japan, whereas India aims to begin in 2022.\\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, as in the U.S., the 4G rollout resulted in significant shareholder value creation that was captured primarily by the U.S.-domiciled FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) and their Asian equivalents, the BATs (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent). “Asia-Pacific carriers also experienced a decline in credit quality as balance sheets became stretched, with significant increases in leverage to fund 4G investments in a highly competitive environment, limiting revenue growth,\" said Alicia Low, head of credit research for the region, based in Australia. \"The proverbial $64,000 question is, will 5G be different for Asia-Pacific wireless network operators?\"\\nPast experiences reduce risk of race to the bottom this time\\nWhile 4G and prior rollouts degenerated into a race to the bottom in terms of prices, 5G incumbents appear to have learned from past experiences, with more rational competition and carriers preferring to differentiate based on network quality and speed rather than exclusively on price.\\nInflation accelerating back to a pre-COVID pace from currently sluggish levels in Asia should provide carriers with cover to lift pricing, but its double-edged sword could also lead to higher-than-expected 5G rollout costs.\\nWe observe greater capital discipline, particularly in developed markets such as South Korea and Australia, in linking 5G investment to demand growth. Following in the footsteps of U.S. counterparts, Asia-Pacific carriers have or are in the process of recycling capital through divestment of infrastructure assets such as cell towers, with proceeds redeployed into 5G, capital management, and debt reduction—all supportive of credit fundamentals.\\nAs in the European Union, the post-pandemic regulatory environment in the Asia-Pacific region is likely to be more benign, with telecoms seen as national champions and enablers for digitization to support economies recovering from COVID. The regulatory pendulum is swinging against FAANGS and BATs because of their market dominance.\\n\"Although it\\'s fraught with danger to declare \\'this time is different,\\'\" said Low, \"four emerging trends—demand-driven capital expenditures, pricing discipline, capital recycling, and more benign regulatory environments—are supportive for both equity and credit markets in Asia-Pacific telecoms not seen in prior rollouts.\"\\nOpportunities for active fixed income managers in global telecoms\\n\"We expect credit profiles in this sector to be broadly stable to slightly improving,\" said Miles. \"There are, however, differences among telecom credits, and we will deploy our global research capabilities to identify which companies in each region may have better prospects for improving their credit profiles and select securities that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns.\"\\nBy investing in a Vanguard active global credit fund, you get access to this expertise and can benefit from attractive investment opportunities globally.Active fixed income at Vanguard\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$335B\\nTaxable bond AUM 14 funds*/1 ETF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$230B\\nMunicipal bond AUM 5 national funds/7 state-specific funds\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30+\\nPortfolio managers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30+\\nTraders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n60+\\nResearch analysts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n140+\\nDedicated team members\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*Includes funds advised by Wellington Management Company LLP.Note: As of December 31, 2021.\\n\\xa0\\nView our active fixed income funds\\n\\xa0Notes:\\n\\nVanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars.

       "  'content': \"Your clients have most likely funded their traditional IRAs for years, if not decades. And they have probably built up a substantial balance in those tax-deferred holdings. But as you know, financial situations, tax brackets, and tax laws change over the years. Your clients' required minimum distributions (RMDs) are not only taxable, they could be quite large and push your clients into higher tax brackets. One way to potentially reduce your clients' tax burden in retirement is to consider converting their traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.\\nAs your clients approach retirement, exploring the tax advantages of a Roth IRA is the perfect opportunity to have a conversation, especially if clients expect their future tax rate to be higher than their current one.\\nHere's how it works: Client assets are transferred from a traditional IRA to a Roth reasonably quickly, but the typical holdup is the tax bill due at the time of conversion. Since traditional IRA assets have been tax-deferred, taxes are due at the time of conversion, and a large tax bill isn't something many clients will be eager to pay. However, these concerns may be overblown in many instances when clients consider their break-even tax rate (BETR).\\nExplore the benefits of a Roth conversion\\nRoth IRAs have several advantages over their traditional counterpart:1\\n\\nNo required minimum distribution—You can guide clients on when and how to withdraw funds.\\nTax-free growth—All investments in the account grow free from taxation.\\nTax-free withdrawals— After age 59½, clients can tap the account without fear of tax or penalty. Basis can also be withdrawn at any time.\\nSocial Security and Medicare flexibility—Doing a Roth IRA conversion before claiming Social Security and Medicare is beneficial, because future distributions from Roth won't impact the tax implications of Social Security and Medicare surcharges.\\nVariety of accounts—Having multiple buckets to withdraw from provides additional tax planning benefits.\\n\\nMany of your clients may understandably still underestimate the perks that a Roth conversion can provide since they must pay a significant tax bill upfront for the transfer. By taking the break-even tax rate (BETR) into account, clients can be shown how Roth conversions are more beneficial than conventional wisdom suggests.\\nUse the BETR calculation for more effective planning\\nThe conventional approach is relatively straightforward. Calculate a client’s future expected tax rate at the anticipated time of withdrawal and compare it with their current expected tax rate. If current rates are lower, the conversion makes sense. If current rates are higher, keep the assets in the traditional IRA.\\nThe BETR could be a more effective calculation than simply comparing future and current tax rates. \\xa0The BETR is the point at which after-tax withdrawal values are the same whether you convert or not and knowing this break-even point could show that a conversion is beneficial in more instances than relying on the conventional comparison between future and present tax rates alone.\\nUsing the BETR takes more data into the equation, such as:\\n\\nAbility to pay conversion taxes from an outside taxable investment account.\\nThe tax basis of the IRA account. A market pullback is often the best time to make a conversion since reduced capital gains means a lighter tax bill.\\nPotential future contributions to the IRA account, like backdoor Roth conversions.\\nClient time horizon (a longer time horizon reduces BETR and makes conversions even more attractive).\\n\\nWhen paying conversion taxes from funds in a taxable account, the BETR approach shows that conversion may be beneficial even if future tax rates are expected to be lower than current rates. Your clients will maximize the assets growing tax-free in the Roth IRA by using taxable funds to pay the conversion tax.\\nThe three scenarios shown in the figure below differ only in the account from which Roth conversion taxes are paid. Each assumes a 35% current marginal tax rate. In Scenario 1, conversion taxes are withheld and paid from the IRA (we assume that no tax penalties are incurred for early withdrawal). In Scenarios 2 and 3, these taxes are not withheld during conversion. Instead, they are paid separately, from either a tax-efficient portfolio in a taxable account (Scenario 2) or a tax-inefficient portfolio in a taxable account (Scenario 3).\\nNotes: Our calculations assume a 6% annual return, a 35% ordinary income tax rate, an 18.8% dividend tax rate, an 18.8% long-term capital gains rate, a 2% dividend yield, 0% basis, and a 20-year investment horizon. For scenarios 2 and 3 our calculations also assume that no additional tax liability is incurred when liquidating assets in a taxable account to pay the conversion taxes. This hypothetical illustration does not represent the return on any particular investment and the rate of return is not guaranteed.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhile having some funds in traditional and Roth IRAs can be beneficial, help your clients understand a Roth conversion's benefits. A Roth IRA is a unique account that your clients can use to reach long-term goals beyond just funding retirement, such as estate planning. Having you as their advisor to discuss these strategies with will provide clients with peace of mind.\\nTo learn more about the BETR approach to Roth conversions, read our research paper below.\"},\n",

Your actions in the coming days, weeks, and months will have a material impact on your client and practice outcomes.\\nYour clients are undoubtedly experiencing the impact, and they may feel compelled to do something as a result, such as changing their asset allocations or even changing advisors.

It is critical to understand that predicting volatility spikes or declines, and the daily direction of the market within volatility regimes has not worked. However, volatility itself does have persistence and, as such, near-term future volatility is influenced by recent trailing volatility. Meaning that when the markets are in a high volatility regime, the expectation for high volatility to persist in the near term is high, with the best and worst days tending to cluster around each other. Eventually, and without a signal, volatility has been known to normalize. This can be seen in the chart below.\\nThe best and worst trading days tend to happen together\\nS&P 500 Index daily price returns January 1, 2020, through May 13, 2022\\nSources: Vanguard calculations using data from FactSet.

However, by doing so, you\\'ll be in a better position with your client base.\\nNow is also a great time to step up your business development and prospecting efforts since your competitors may also be experiencing the dread of proactively reaching out in these down markets. A proactive conversation in which you convince a client to stay the course could justify many years of fees in terms of value added (see below). Look back to the most recent major market downturn from 2020. Even accounting for the current return environment, your clients would have been much better off (+8% versus –17%) by staying invested versus moving to cash, or a difference of approximately 25%, and are likely much more satisfied, loyal, and inclined to listen to you today as a result.\\nThe COVID-19 crisis tells the stay-the-course tale\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

       "  'content': 'Soaring inflation. Rising rates. Market volatility. Your clients are most likely calling you with every headline looking for your guidance on how to adjust, if at all, their portfolio strategies. As you know, the Federal Reserve has commenced an anticipated series of interest rate hikes to stem inflation, and the effects are starting to reverberate throughout financial markets.\\nSo what are the kinds of portfolio management strategies for responding not only to the rocky, recent past quarter, but also to the prospect of a rising-rates environment over the next cycle? The fixed income allocation of your clients\\' portfolios is a good place to start—picking up our previous analysis of the historically poor bond performance in the first quarter of 2022.\\nAre bonds getting too risky?\\nAfter digesting the results of the unpleasant first quarter of 2022, your clients and some of you might wonder if their current allocation to bonds is still appropriate.\\nIn conducting this evaluation, you and your clients would do well to keep a few things in mind—some obvious, some perhaps not immediately so:\\n\\nAs with most investments, bonds carry risk. But historically, they\\'ve had and continue to have lower downside capital risk than stocks. In fact, the magnitude of fixed income drawdowns has paled to that of stocks (See chart below, \"Stocks exhibit exponentially more drawdown risk than bonds\"). For clients who are more risk averse, this can be a crucial distinction.\\nAllocation attempts to address multiple types of risk. Here, you have an opportunity to reframe the conversation by educating clients on those other forms of risk. For example, stocks come with greater drawdown risk, but less purchasing power risk than do more conservative investments. With inflation front-and-center in the news cycle, it\\'s an opportune time to explain why holding periods, goals, objectives, and behaviors matter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStocks exhibit exponentially more drawdown risk than bonds\\nAnnual returns and max intra-year drawdown\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nNotes: U.S. bonds as represented by IA SBBI U.S. Intermediate-Term Government Bond Index from January 1, 1970, to December 31, 1972; Bloomberg U.S. Government/Credit Intermediate-Term Index from January 1, 1973, to December 31, 1975; Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index from January 1, 1976, to June 30, 2009; and Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Float Adjusted thereafter.

But it\\'s often a different thing entirely to communicate the benefits of deliberate, patient action to clients—especially as they watch their portfolio balances dwindle. Following are a few things you can do to help clients feel supported and that they are continuing progress toward their goals.\\nReframe the conversation\\n\\nTake an EQ+IQ approach—that is, reinforce the \"emotional intelligence\" of empathetic understanding with your informed perspective as a financial professional.\\nFocus on progress toward and continued ability to meet goals—remind them to view short-term returns in a big-picture perspective; and to keep track of \"the numbers they care about\" that represent long-term objectives.\\nConsider language using success rate percentages rather than market return percentages.\\n\\nEvaluate whether the client\\'s circumstances have changed\\n\\nGiven recent experiences, do you have insight into the client\\'s risk tolerance that might warrant a strategic change to their portfolio?\\nAre their goals still in reach?\\n\\nKnow that staying the course requires action\\n\\nRebalance the portfolio if allocations have drifted out of tolerance bands.\\nPerform tax-loss harvesting if appropriate.\\nUse the opportunity to perform portfolio cleanup (review asset location, concentrated positions, and high-cost legacy positions).\\nConsider Roth conversions where appropriate.\\nImplement a dynamic spending strategy for retirees.\\n\\nPortfolio response: Remember that higher current yields mean higher future nominal returns\\nThe Fed\\'s recent nudge upward of the federal funds rate has increased interest rates throughout the economy—including current yields on bonds. As yields go up, bond prices go down. For bondholders with a need to sell assets prior to maturity in the near term, this relationship is understandably disheartening. But as an investor\\'s time horizon (and potential ability to benefit from higher rates) lengthens, that can be good news.\\nFor you, that means a need to evaluate a fixed income client\\'s investment duration versus the duration of their portfolio\\'s fixed income holdings. (See chart, below, \"How might things look from here?\" for a hypothetical depiction of return outcomes across a range of potential interest rate changes).\\nHow might things look from here?\\nHypothetical impact of changes in interest rates, Q1 2022\\nThis hypothetical example does not represent the return on any particular investment.\\nNotes: \"No change\" yields are as of December 31, 2021, based on the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and \"End of Q1 2022\" hypotheticals are as of March 31, 2022. For simplicity, duration was assumed to remain at 6.8 years for year end 2021 and 6.58 years for end of Q1 2022; but in practice, as yields change, duration also changes. Such a dramatic change in yields as this example assumes would likely constitute a rather significant adjustment to a fund\\'s weighted average duration. For purposes of illustration, we assumed no change to yields in subsequent years.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nWhat changes might you consider for clients\\' fixed income portfolios?\\nA client\\'s situation might dictate a need to search for more productive sources of yield—for instance, if they have a shorter time horizon and more immediate income is a concern. There are various rates and yield curve calls an advisor might consider, but they come with caveats.\\nRates and yield curve calls\\n\\nShorten duration and increase credit exposure—but acknowledge this can lead to a more equity-like portfolio in terms of drawdown risk.\\nTrade duration—but know that this has not historically been a reliable source of alpha.\\nChoose to avoid bonds altogether, and instead barbell with cash and equities. But one must factor the considerable likelihood of being wrong on interest rates and improperly timing re-entry into bonds. Predicting rates, historically, has been an activity fraught with off-target forecasts (see the chart, below, \"Making the right call on rates has proven difficult\").\\n\\nMaking the right call on rates has proven difficult\\nU.S. federal funds effective rate and forward rates\\nNotes: Monthly data are from January 31, 2008, to February 28, 2022. The federal funds effective rate is annualized. Forward rates are based on futures contracts with tenor up to 2 years.\\nSource: Bloomberg.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSimilarly, you have a number of credit selection and sector rotation options at your disposal—and those options come with important caveats and questions to be answered. All those decisions amount to a lot to manage on top of running a practice, maintaining client relationships, and prospecting; engaging an outside, dedicated active fixed income manager could therefore be advantageous.\\nCredit selection and sector rotation\\n\\nAs an advisor, you need to determine what benchmark to use on the client performance report. If you change the duration, are you also changing the benchmark? If so, how are you explaining the change to your client? If not, are you okay taking the practice risk of incurring tracking error and potentially underperforming? Do you have the same capabilities (not to mention time) as dedicated active asset managers?\\nGiven all of the risks of managing duration on your own, hiring a world-class active manager such as Vanguard for your fixed income exposures can better capture in real time the potential advantages of outperformance, as opposed to you trying to time the bond markets.\\nLow-cost active bond funds don\\'t force the active manager to take on risk to overcome large \"fee hurdles,\" and therefore the breakeven for active success is achievable.\\n\\nKeep your clients focused on their long term plans\\nAfter a distressing Q1 for their bond portfolios, clients may need reassurance that their plans still work for them. You can show them that in the big picture, three-year returns were, in fact, near the median. As you\\'re encouraging this longer-term outlook, dip into the reservoir of trust you\\'ve developed to serve as your clients\\' behavioral coach—this is where you deliver your ultimate value.\\nAlso consider these key action items and perspectives:\\n\\nUse the opportunity to clean up the portfolio and focus on tax efficiency.\\nKeep in mind that while higher current yields mean lower current asset prices, they also mean higher future nominal returns.\\nFigure out how much you want to change the portfolio, if at all. If changes are in order, then it may be worth drawing upon the depth of expertise that a talented team of low-cost, active fixed income professionals at Vanguard can offer. Leveraging a team of specialists and their insights could provide more advantages than trying to time the bond market on your own—with the added benefits of saving you time and lowering risk to your practice.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSpecial thanks to Ted Dinucci for contributing to this article.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'With inflation at a 40-year high and the labor market still tight, the Federal Reserve has pulled another instrument from its monetary policy toolbox. In addition to raising its key interest rate target by half a percentage point on May 4, the Fed has said it will start to shrink its balance sheet, another step in post-pandemic policy normalization.\\nExpanding the balance sheet by buying government bonds on the open market, known as quantitative easing, is an unconventional tool that the Fed and other central banks use to stimulate economies when policy interest rates are near or below zero and can\\'t effectively be lowered further. Now, with rates rising, there\\'s logic in the balance sheet\\'s expansion being reversed.\\n\"The Fed has minimal experience in removing stimulus by shrinking its balance sheet,\" said Josh Hirt, a Vanguard senior economist who studies the Fed, \"so markets unsurprisingly take notice. That\\'s especially true now as the Fed plans to move with a less cautious cadence compared with the previous time it employed quantitative tightening.\"\\nWhat\\'s behind the faster pace of quantitative tightening?\\nThe Fed plans to reduce its $8.5 trillion balance sheet beginning June 1, when it will no longer reinvest proceeds of up to $30 billion in maturing Treasury securities and up to $17.5 billion in maturing agency mortgage-backed securities per month. Beginning September 1, those caps will rise to $60 billion and $35 billion, respectively, for a maximum potential monthly balance sheet roll-off of $95 billion.\\nThe Fed ended bond purchases only in March 2022, so this tightening is occurring considerably sooner than in the last reduction cycle. After the global financial crisis, the Fed ended quantitative easing purchases in 2014 but didn\\'t start to reduce its balance sheet until 2017. The maximum roll-off then was roughly half of that expected this time around.\\nThree key factors explain today\\'s faster pace:\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s balance sheet is significantly larger this time relative to what would be considered an optimal range to effectively implement monetary policy.\\nThe economy is at a more advanced stage of the business cycle and running hotter, as reflected in a smaller output gap, lower unemployment, and higher inflation than in 2014.\\nThe Fed is likely less uncertain now about how markets and financial conditions may react given that it has at least some experience in communicating and executing roll-off plans.\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s balance sheet roll-off: Different circumstances, different plan\\nNotes: Inflation gap is defined as the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index relative to the Federal Reserve\\'s 2% inflation target. Employment gap is defined as the unemployment rate relative to NAIRU, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, the Fed\\'s estimate of long-run unemployment. Output gap is defined as real GDP relative to the Congressional Budget Office\\'s assessment of real potential GDP. Estimate for the balance sheet roll-off path assumes that monthly proceeds of $30 billion in Treasury securities and $17.5 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) won\\'t be reinvested in the three months beginning June 1, 2022. Beginning September 1, 2022, monthly Treasury and MBS roll-off caps will rise to $60 billion and $35 billion, respectively. For MBS, roll-off after September 1, 2022, assumes forecasted MBS prepayments per the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\\'s \"Federal Reserve Asset Purchases: The Pandemic Response and Considerations Ahead,\" March 2, 2022. Consistent with \"Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve\\'s Balance Sheet,\" May 4, 2022, the estimated roll-off pace slows and then stops when the balance sheet is within range of optimal to allow assets to grow into the optimal range. The optimal balance sheet estimate comprises a constant $1.5 trillion level of required reserves, currency in circulation grown by 4% nominal GDP, and a constant 2.8% of GDP allocation for Treasury general account and other liabilities as per Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\\'s March 8, 2019, speech \"Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead.\"\\nSources: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Refinitiv, and Vanguard.\\n\\nWhy interest rates will remain the Fed\\'s primary tool\\nWhat likely won\\'t change is the Fed favoring the policy rate as its primary tool to effect policy, with balance sheet reduction running in the proverbial background to maximize predictability and minimize market disruption. That, along with concerns that balance sheet reduction would lead to much higher interest rates at the long end of the yield curve, is why the Fed set monthly caps for letting bonds mature passively rather than planning to actively sell securities from its portfolio.\\nAnother consideration relates to the eventual terminal size of the balance sheet in terms of ensuring adequate market liquidity and carrying out monetary policy, which would serve as a guide for when the Fed would end asset roll-off. At present, this terminal size is uncertain. However, as shown in the graphic using simplifying assumptions, Vanguard estimates that the balance sheet may settle around 18% of GDP, or just above $5 trillion, before the Fed begins winding down and eventually ending its roll-off, at which point it will allow its assets to grow in relation to the size of the economy. \"That level could be reached around the end of 2025, barring any pauses or significant deviations from the currently communicated plan,\" Hirt said.\\nA challenging environment for central banks ahead\\nThe Fed\\'s tightening plan comes with challenges, according to Brian Quigley, Vanguard head of MBS, agencies, and volatility. \"Judging the appropriate pace and cumulative amount of tightening will be more difficult,\" Quigley said. \"The Fed stepping away as a buyer of the market will prompt a period of adjustment that will ripple across financial markets as valuations will have to cheapen to attract more price-sensitive buyers. That this will be happening as a number of other major central banks will be hiking rates and unwinding their balance sheets is a complicating factor.\"\\nHow effectively policymakers remove accommodations from global economies will remain a crucial theme for 2022 and beyond. In the near term, Vanguard economists continue to expect that economic growth and the labor market will moderate but remain strong toward year-end. Core measures of inflation (removing volatile food and energy prices) are similarly expected to moderate throughout the year but to stay at levels well above the Fed\\'s 2% target.\\nAmid a challenging environment for central banks to balance inflation dynamics, the pace and eventual end point of policy rate increases will likely remain a focal point beyond 2022.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Helping your clients weather market cycles and enjoy better risk-adjusted results takes a planned approach. It includes a thorough evaluation of how the timing and execution of rebalancing may affect their portfolios and generate tax consequences.\\nPart of a solid rebalancing plan is to decide whether to rebalance on a periodic basis, or as the result of passing certain thresholds in drift, keeping in mind some tax-efficient methods to rebalance.\\nHere are six tactics for rebalancing a portfolio in a more tax-efficient way:1. Start with tax-advantaged accounts\\nOne place to begin is rebalancing your clients' tax-advantaged accounts. The benefit of this approach is that any rebalancing trades are tax-exempt at the time they are made. This avoids immediate tax consequences that may be beneficial in periods of high income.\\nYou will find this opportunity easiest to implement if your clients have a mix of asset classes in their accounts. Roth accounts can be particularly advantageous since portions of the Roth can be distributed tax-exempt at any time (up to principal) and enjoy tax-advantaged distribution rules.\\n2. Re-direct cash flows in taxable accounts\\nWith taxable accounts, one way to rebalance is by directing new purchases and reinvested distributions into underweighted asset classes. For example, when a portfolio with a target allocation of 50% stocks and 50% bonds has drifted beyond the plan's target allocation threshold, it might make sense to add new contributions or reinvest dividends to the underweighted side until the portfolio is back at the target allocation. Conversely, when taking a withdrawal, it might make sense to draw down from an overweight asset class.\\nFor your clients taking the required minimum distribution from their retirement account(s), but who don't need the distribution for daily living expenses, those assets can also be reinvested to increase the allocations to an underweighted asset class in nonretirement accounts.\\n3. Consider cost basis\\nWhen rebalancing, look for opportunities to harvest losses or manage cost basis across holdings in your clients' portfolios. Understanding their current and future expected income can help evaluate which shares to sell or which accounting method is most advantageous. In comparatively low-income years, you may want to sell lower-basis shares. In comparatively high-income years, it might make sense to sell higher-basis shares. If income is relatively stable year over year, an average accounting method may be the right answer. An average accounting method is easy to use but could limit some tax-planning strategies because clients are locked into this method for all shares they own until a new method is chosen. If a household's income generally has peaks and valleys, watching cost basis may help control taxes in the long run.\\n4. Explore charitable giving and annual gifting\\nYou may want to consider rebalancing opportunities when your clients are deciding how and what to gift. It might make sense to gift shares of overweighted holdings with a low-cost basis in a taxable account directly to the desired charity or beneficiary. For example, when gifting to a beneficiary in a lower marginal tax bracket, consider evaluating options to gift shares in-kind rather than to gift cash. This strategy might also make sense when gifting to a charity. Additionally, charitably inclined clients may focus their rebalancing in an IRAs and use the proceeds to fund a qualified charitable distributions (QCDs).\\n5. Keep in mind the timing of fund distributions when rebalancing near year-end\\nIt's all about timing. When rebalancing, it might make sense to sell before a distribution to avoid the taxes on that distribution. Conversely, buying right before a distribution may have its own tax and income implications.\\n6. Use rebalancing to improve the tax efficiency of the portfolio\\nMany portfolios were originally built based on priorities other than tax efficiency. Take advantage of rebalancing opportunities to shift the portfolio into more tax-efficient options, such as exchange-traded funds, passive investments, or other low-turnover options.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you found this content interesting and want to read more, check out our recommendations below.\"},\n",

Nominal municipal bonds featured a yield to maturity of 2.79% as of July 31.1 That presented attractive valuations both relative to other bond sectors and from a historical perspective. In the past ten years, muni yields have only been higher 13% of the time within daily observations. With a AAA Muni yield/Treasury ratio of 97% at 30 years, tax-exempt debt is particularly attractive in the long end of the yield curve.\\nDepending on an investor's state and federal income tax brackets and the particular investment, the investor's tax-equivalent municipal yield may be higher than 5%. For investors in higher-tax states like California and New York, taxable-equivalent yields of corresponding state indexes may be nearly 5.75% for CA, or higher for NY.\\nMunicipal tax-equivalent yields are relatively attractive\\n(as of July 31, 2022)\\nSource: Bloomberg indexes, using yield-to-worst data as of July 31, 2022.

The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nDespite the negative returns it took to get here, higher municipal yields potentially can provide higher levels of tax-exempt income for years to come.\\nHow the market turned\\nThe municipal market, despite its idiosyncratic nature, is much influenced by U.S. Treasury yields. When Federal Reserve officials signaled their commitment to fighting inflation early this year, investors began pricing in some 11 to 13 quarter-point expected interest rate hikes through 2022, which upended the fixed income markets. Municipals were no exception.\\nA fundamentally solid market\\nTypically, a significant risk-off event is required to reach current yield levels, such as an economic recession. Such conditions threaten downgrades or even defaults. But in today's environment, municipal credit has been bolstered by federal fiscal stimulus provided directly both to municipalities as well as to end consumers.\\nState and local income tax revenues have risen at a velocity not seen in 20 years, easing near-term credit concerns. Issuers have used some of the flood of finances to build up their rainy-day funds, which can be a cushion for meeting budgets even during recessionary or otherwise difficult conditions. All of which means that credit conditions are better than they have been in years. Such measures will likely safeguard municipal bond valuations relative to other credit sectors (like U.S. corporates) in the event of a downturn.\\nStates' rainy-day funds as a percentage of general fund expenditures\\n(50-state median, for fiscal years indicated)\\nSources: Pew Charitable Trusts, using data from the National Association of State Budget Officers as of December 31, 2021.\\n\\n\\nNational totals for state and local income taxes\\n(in billions)\\nSource: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, as of June 30, 2022.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nCost averaging in reentry\\nThese arguments for an attractive yield in a healthy market are not meant as a timing signal, since there are risks with all investments.\\nIt is possible that the market will continue to price in more interest rate hikes and that outflows could continue. Either of these potential events could lead to further price drops (and yield increases) in the near future.\\nHowever, the bond market has already factored in an aggressive Fed rate-hiking campaign. While there is substantial uncertainty around Fed policy in 2023, longer term yields seem to be settling close to the Federal Reserve's long-run neutral rate of 2.5%. If markets calm around these levels, it could create a technical tailwind for municipal bond pricing as cash that left tax-exempt funds earlier in 2022 may return.\\nInvestors considering a new allocation to the muni sector, or those hoping for reentry after fleeing earlier this year, might consider a cost-averaging strategy. This would help diversify the risk of coming in too early or too late.\\nA better buffer\\nWith yields as high as they are, municipal bond funds offer a buffer against yields rising even further. A muni bond fund with a yield of 2.79% and a duration of 6 years, would still provide a positive return for the next 12 months even if yields were to rise another 40 basis points across the curve.\\nDuration is the weighted average time for an investor to receive coupon interest and principal payments that would potentially allow the investor to recoup the bond's price from its cash flows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVanguard municipal bond funds\\n\\n\\nAdmiral™ or ETF Shares\\n\\n\\nExpense ratio2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNational\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTax-Exempt Bond ETF\\n\\n\\nVTEB\\n\\n\\n0.05%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVWSUX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLimited-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVMLUX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntermediate-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVWIUX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVWLUX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh-Yield Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVWALX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nState\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalifornia Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVCADX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalifornia Long-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVCLAX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMassachusetts Tax-Exempt3\\n\\n\\nVMATX\\n\\n\\n0.13%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew Jersey Long-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVNJUX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew York Long-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVNYUX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOhio Long-Term Tax-Exempt3\\n\\n\\nVOHIX\\n\\n\\n0.13%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPennsylvania Long-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVPALX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n1 Figures as indicated by the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index.\\n2 As reported in each fund’s most recent prospectus.

       "  'content': \"Central banks have an unenviable challenge in the months ahead: trying to gain control of inflation without choking off economic growth. To succeed, they’ll need to raise interest rates to just the right level. Overshoot with too-restrictive policy, and they risk inviting recession. Undershoot, and they put their hard-earned credibility at risk by letting inflation fester.Three factors will determine whether central banks can navigate a soft landing of continued growth with prices rising at acceptable levels, or whether they miss an uncomfortably short runway:• The pace of rate hikes required for central banks to assert their inflation-fighting credibility.• How much wage and inflation expectations rise in defiance of that credibility.• The incidence of additional unanticipated shocks to supply or demand.Whether central banks succeed in delivering a soft landing will depend in part on how high they raise rates above the neutral rate, and how long they keep them there. (The neutral rate is the level at which policy interest rates would neither stimulate nor restrict an economy.)\\nMarket policy rate expectations reflect a tale of two regions\\nNotes: Market expectations for central bank policy rates at a given time are represented by one-month forward swap rates. U.S. swaps are based on published overnight federal funds rate indexes. Euro area swaps are based on the published euro overnight index average. Neutral rate ranges are Vanguard estimates. Estimates of the neutral rate are determined by long-term economic factors and are subject to a wide band of statistical uncertainty. Estimates of the nominal neutral rate assume inflation of 2% in the U.S. and 1.8% in the euro area.Sources: Vanguard analysis using data from Bloomberg, as of April 27, 2022.\\n\\nMarket expectations of the terminal interest rate—the highest point in a rate-hiking cycle—have increased significantly since March. However, central bank challenges vary by region, and differences are readily apparent when comparing the United States with the euro area.\\nIn the U.S., where headline inflation has soared to 8.5%, markets are pricing in a terminal rate of 3.5% by mid-2023. This likely reflects the expectation that the Fed will be aggressive in fighting inflation amid a tight labor market.The chart also highlights the Fed’s exposure to potential policy error. Policy rates above neutral will be effective in fighting inflation precisely because they restrict economic activity—which increases the risk of recession. (An initial estimate of first-quarter U.S. GDP showed an unexpected economic contraction. This exemplifies the challenging signals that the Fed may encounter in the months ahead.)\\nInflation dynamics support lower euro area policy rates\\nNotes: Core inflation excludes volatile food and energy prices and is considered a better indicator of persistent inflation.Sources: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Eurostat, and Bloomberg, as of April 27, 2022.\\n\\nMarkets in the euro area, meanwhile, anticipate that the European Central Bank (ECB) will raise interest rates more slowly toward the neutral rate.\\nEuro area headline inflation rose to 7.4% in March. More than half the latest surge was attributable to energy prices, a component less likely to translate into higher persistent inflation. Inflation in the U.S. has been more broad-based—and thus more likely to persist—with only around a quarter recently attributable to energy prices. Moreover, the pace at which wage and inflation expectations could rise in defiance of central bank credibility appears higher in the U.S. compared with the euro area.\\nUnanticipated shocks matter to policy rates, too \\nThe path of interest rates over the next 12 months is not predetermined. It will depend on forthcoming data and unanticipated shocks. A further round of disruptions to supply—owing, for instance, to the spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in China or restrictions on the flow of natural gas between Russia and Europe—would likely stoke global inflation.\\nUncertainty surrounding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a more immediate concern than inflation in the euro area, given the region’s proximity to the conflict. Consumer confidence is down. Any hints of weakness in forthcoming GDP readings will likely become part of the ECB’s rate-setting calculus.\\nCentral bank credibility benefits businesses and households\\nInflation has reached levels that many parts of the developed world haven’t seen for 30 to 40 years. That makes the current bout of fast-rising prices a crucial test for central banks, some of which started targeting inflation in the early 1990s.\\nWe believe that a soft landing in the U.S. is possible, but more than that, we believe the Fed will do whatever it takes to bring inflation under control. When all is said and done, inflation back at central banks’ 2% targets will benefit businesses and households alike. Low and stable inflation engenders the confidence that economies need to thrive.\\n\\xa0\\nSub-asset class performance in a rising real rate environment\\nLearn what sub-asset classes historically have outperformed during rising real rate environments.\\nView insightsFragile–handle with care\\nBond returns plunged near record lows to begin 2022.

       "  'content': 'Consumers expect most things to be customized these days, from sneakers to car insurance. You may have noticed that investors are increasingly adopting direct indexing strategies to personalize their investing experiences as well.1 The topic may be generating buzz, but what exactly is direct indexing and how does it work? Which of your clients could potentially benefit from the strategy?\\nFirst, let\\'s clarify the name. Financial services providers are using several terms in addition to direct indexing to describe this technology, including personalized indexing and custom indexing. We use the term personalized—and named our product Vanguard Personalized Indexing—because we feel it\\'s the most accurate: Our intuitive software allows advisors to personalize each portfolio to suit their clients\\' preferences, values, and tax situations.\\nHow does personalized indexing work?\\nPicture the way familiar investments like mutual funds or ETFs are constructed. Investors own shares of a basket of securities that seeks to track a given benchmark, such as the S&P 500 or the Russell 3000. By contrast, personalized indexing investors directly own individual stocks in a separately managed account (SMA) that represents a chosen market-capitalization-weighted benchmark. Typically, it\\'s not necessary to own every stock in an index in order approximate its performance.\\nBecause investors have direct ownership of the individual securities in their portfolios, they gain unique opportunities for tax efficiency and personalization that may not be possible with ETFs and mutual funds:\\n\\nImproved tax efficiency. Personalized indexing provides increased opportunities for tax-loss harvesting (TLH) of individual securities, which can help you capture additional tax alpha for your clients. The technology also allows you to guide clients through tax-effective transitions to personalized indexing.\\nExpressing ESG preferences and factor tilts. You can help clients express environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or socially responsible investing (SRI) preferences. You can tilt their portfolios toward stocks with certain characteristics like momentum or value, known as factors.\\nTransparency. Because you know exactly what\\'s in the portfolio, you can construct completion portfolios around concentrated positions at the individual security level, while minimizing the tax impact.\\n\\nSource: Vanguard\\n\\nIs personalized indexing a new strategy?\\nUltra-high-net-worth investors have been using SMAs for years. In the past, investors had to be able to afford to buy the stocks needed to approximate a given index\\'s performance. Rebalancing the portfolio so it continued to correspond to the index was also difficult and time-consuming for investors and their advisors.\\nSeveral relatively recent developments have made personalized indexing accessible to a wider range of investors. Software innovations have automated processes such as regular scanning for TLH opportunities and rebalancing. Most brokerage firms now offer commission-free trades, dramatically reducing transaction costs. Additionally, investors now have the ability to buy fractional shares of stocks, making it more affordable to fund an SMA that models an index.\\nWhy is TLH so important in personalized indexing?\\nYou likely already use year-end TLH to help improve your clients’ after-tax returns. Personalized indexing opens up many more opportunities for TLH that can help you capture additional tax alpha for them.\\nUnlike bundled products such as mutual funds or ETFs, personalized indexing allows investors to harvest losses at the security level. Here\\'s how it works: Stocks that drop below their cost basis are sold, and correlated (but not \"substantially identical\") replacement stocks are immediately repurchased to navigate the wash-sale rule.2 Because personalized indexing investors have direct ownership of the individual stocks in their portfolios, losses can be captured even in a year when the index gains in value.\\nFor example, the value of the S&P 500 increased 9.76% in the fourth quarter of 2021, yet there were still 133 individual companies that lost value during that time.3 Harvested losses can be used to offset capital gains and then up to $3,000 of ordinary taxable income (as of the 2021 tax year). Losses can also be carried forward to future years.\\nThe frequency that a personalized indexing portfolio is scanned for TLH opportunities—quarterly, monthly, or even daily (as with Vanguard Personalized Indexing)—is key to maximizing investors\\' tax alpha. Our sophisticated algorithms automatically review each account daily and harvest individual security losses as opportunities arise. Personalized indexing with daily TLH has boosted some investors\\' after-tax returns by 1%–2% or more.4 For high-net-worth investors, TLH in a personalized index can continue to deliver tax alpha even if the market experiences sustained low volatility.\\nMarginal contribution to maximal TLH alpha*\\n*Assumes quarterly contributions\\nSource: Kevin Khang, Alan Cummings, Thomas Paradise, and Brennan O’Connor, 2022. Personalized indexing: A portfolio construction plan. Valley Forge, Pa.: The Vanguard Group. Simulation as of September 2021.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne problem that can arise with systematically harvesting tax losses is that eventually you will have sold all the losing stocks in the portfolio. Because of the potential capital gains that would result from selling those low-cost-basis stocks, switching to another investing strategy could be costly.\\nFor this reason, personalized indexing with TLH is more effective when there is regular cash flow (to purchase new securities) and when used as a strategy for high-net-worth investors in higher tax brackets, who may have realized gains from other types of investments, such as real estate, private equity, or hedge funds. Other investors may decide not to sell the stocks in their personalized indexes at all but, rather, plan to leave them to charity, since nonprofits don\\'t owe federal income tax on gifts.\\nWhat if my clients want to customize their portfolios?\\nInvestors increasingly say that expressing ESG or SRI preferences in their investment portfolios is important to them.⁵ Whether they want to support companies with a low-carbon footprint or base their choices on United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, personalized indexing makes it simple for you to align clients’ investments with their values. You can:\\n\\nApply screens to exclude companies that produce tobacco, for example, or have been flagged for human rights abuses.\\nApply tilts to add a preferential weight to the portfolio to maximize certain positive attributes, such as gender diversity or sustainable development.\\nExclude specific companies from the portfolio, either for personal reasons or because of a large, existing holding of a stock. For example, an Apple executive whose portfolio is heavily concentrated in tech stocks could build a personalized index around that concentration.\\n\\nAdditionally, you or your client may have a conviction in certain risk factors such as value, momentum, or volatility. Personalized indexing can help you manage those factors in addition to any ESG/SRI screens or tilts.\\nWhen is personalized indexing right for my clients?\\nFor the right clients, personalized indexing is a powerful tool that can help you solve complex financial problems. However, it\\'s not a good fit for every investor. Let\\'s look at some situations where clients might benefit from this strategy:\\n\\nCapturing tax alpha. Clients in a higher federal income tax bracket with taxable accounts and lots of capital gains to offset could benefit from the TLH capabilities of personalized indexing—with the highest benefit coming from daily TLH scanning.\\nExpressing ESG/SRI preferences. If clients have strong ESG or SRI convictions that require an increased level of precision to screen or tilt individual stocks, personalized indexing could be a solution.\\nApplying factor exposures. You can easily tilt a portfolio to incorporate traditional risk factors such as momentum or value. Personalized indexing gives you the control to express specific market views or outlooks for your clients, or to diversify factor exposure around a client\\'s broader portfolio.\\nDiversifying a concentrated position. You can build tax-efficient completion portfolios around large existing stock holdings at the individual security level.\\n\\nConsider how personalized indexing technology might help you differentiate your practice while giving appropriate clients the tax-efficient, customized investing experience they expect.

We\\'re keeping a close eye, however, on interest rates, monetary policy, and their potential growth effects.\\n\\nRisks to growth specifically from oil prices have moderated in recent weeks, with oil trading within the $95 to $105 per barrel range that we see as consistent with above-trend 2022 GDP growth.\\nGDP grew at an annual rate of 6.9% in the fourth quarter, up from 2.3% third-quarter growth, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis final estimate.\\nFor all of 2021, real GDP grew by 5.7%, compared with a contraction of 3.4% in 2020, when the pandemic set in.\\n\\nEuro area\\nThe growth environment in the euro area is challenged by the war in Ukraine, the resulting higher energy prices, reduced confidence, and somewhat tighter financial conditions. We continue to foresee full-year growth in a range of 2.5% to 3.0%, lower than our outlook before the war for growth around 3.5%.\\n\\nConsumer confidence at its lowest since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and diminished business confidence help inform our view, as do the somewhat offsetting effects anticipated from additional fiscal stimulus.\\nFor the fourth quarter, GDP grew by 0.3% on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with the third quarter.\\n\\nChina\\nWorsening COVID-19 outbreaks have led to lockdowns affecting more people in China than at any other point since 2020 and purchasing managers\\' index readings imply that a sharp economic slowdown took hold in March.\\n\\nChina set an official 2022 growth target \"around 5.5%\" at the early-March National People\\'s Congress, the lowest growth target it has ever set. Vanguard maintains its forecast for 2022 China growth around 5%.\\nFiscal and monetary stimulus early in the year boosted the economy in January and February, offsetting the March weakness.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nVanguard continues to see economic growth around 5.5% in emerging markets broadly in 2022, but high food and energy prices related to the war in Ukraine place risks firmly to the downside.\\n\\nEnergy prices have risen steadily since the start of the year but have moderated at elevated levels recently. And although higher commodities prices do benefit some emerging economies, they\\'re a negative taken in the aggregate.\\nHigher food prices have stoked tensions in some emerging markets.\\nExpectations for central bank rate cuts next year in economies that have raised rates this year speak to the slowdown risk.\\n\\nEnergy, food, and housing costs drive inflation higher\\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States rose by 8.5% in March compared with a year earlier, higher than a 7.9% year-on-year gain in February. That gain alongside a seasonally adjusted month-on-month gain of 1.2% was largely in line with market expectations.\\n\\nGasoline, food, and shelter contributed the most to the broad increase. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 6.5% compared with a year earlier.\\nSeparately, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation indicator in considering monetary policy, rose 0.4% in February, a slower pace of increase than the 0.5% reading in each of the four preceding months.\\nVanguard believes that core inflation may have neared its peak, but that elevated headline inflation, reflecting not just high energy prices but also accelerating food prices, is likely to be an increasingly important factor in the Federal Reserve’s policy calculus.\\n\\nInflation and wage pressures prompt Fed action\\nAccelerating inflation and a still-tightening labor market have led us to revise our view on the Federal Reserve. We foresee the equivalent of six to eight 25-basis-point hikes to the federal funds rate target in 2022, with the potential for one or two 50-basis-point hikes in the mix. (Any 50-point hike would count as two of our anticipated 2022 hikes.)\\n\\nThe change of view is a bringing forward of anticipated rate hikes from 2023 into 2022. We continue to foresee a terminal rate around 3%, though we\\'re evaluating inflation, wage, and labor-market conditions for evidence that an even higher terminal rate may be in order.\\nAs early as its May 4 meeting, the Fed could announce that it will start to reduce its balance sheet by a level that would quickly rise to as much as $95 billion per month.\\nShould investors adjust their portfolios in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve enacting the first in what is likely to be a series of interest rate hikes? For most investors, the answer will be no, other than regular rebalancing. But history shows that certain sub-asset classes have consistently outperformed during rising real rate environments.\\nThe current environment may present opportunities for those investors who have the ability and willingness to take some active risk and be a little more targeted in their approach.\\n\\nProlonged and persistent periods of real rate increases favor some sub-asset classes\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bloomberg; CRSP; Kenneth R.

Vanguard considers climate change—and the evolving global policy responses required to mitigate its impact—to be a material and fundamental risk to companies and to their shareholders\\' long-term financial success. Accordingly, we have an important role to play in engaging and encouraging real progress by portfolio companies to mitigate the potential consequences of climate change.

The net impact on global GDP is negative, however, in all scenarios.\\nIn the best-case scenario, if countries and companies align to adhere to the 1.5 degree Celsius target versus pre-industrial levels set by global policymakers in the Paris Agreement,1 our forecast is for a net drag of around 2%–4% on global GDP by 2050. In the worst-case scenario, where policymakers make no additional progress to reduce emissions and temperatures rise by more than 3 degrees, the global economy could see a net drag closer to 10%. (See figure below.)\\nThe net impact of climate change on global GDP by 2050\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nIn the coming decades, the effects of climate change on the global economy and financial markets will not follow a straight line. We expect significant regional disparities, and the possibility of climate-related economic shocks. Investors may experience periods of heightened volatility in the financial markets as the effects of climate change become more apparent through events such as storms, droughts, flooding, heat waves, and wildfires. Policy measures aimed at combating climate change can hamper economic growth too, particularly if those measures are late, abrupt, or reactive rather than early, transitioned, and thoughtful.\\nOf course, efforts by consumers, businesses, and policymakers to address climate risk offer investors opportunities as well. As our economic analysis indicates, significant investments will be required in the decades ahead to change how power is generated, buildings are constructed, agriculture is managed, and goods are shipped to achieve policymakers\\' goals. While transition effects, market changes and regulations may provide headwinds for some, this transformation will spur new technologies, markets, and growth opportunities for others.\\nWays Vanguard is mitigating climate risk\\nCommitting to working with policymakers on behalf of long-term investors\\nVanguard is committed to working with policymakers to represent the best interests of investors. While companies, asset managers, and individual investors can all play a role in mitigating climate risk, we firmly believe that governments must lead the way. Government leaders are specifically empowered and charged with considering competing interests and crafting public policy that will address complex societal impacts and make the appropriate tradeoffs. Government action may also have the added benefit of applying equally to relevant entities such as private companies and state-owned enterprises. Our hope is that policymakers will set long-term expectations that provide clarity to individuals, companies, and the financial markets as to government plans and targets.\\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement remains the most referenced example of an inter-governmental climate change agreement that has resulted in commitments and targets for countries and companies to meet. Vanguard expects the companies that our funds invest in to follow applicable climate rules and commitments set forth by policymakers in their respective jurisdictions, and to plan appropriately for emerging risks and regulation in this area. We engage with the companies in our funds\\' investment portfolios accordingly.\\nStill, significant opportunities remain for policymakers to develop the frameworks and mechanisms that will enable markets to function effectively in the coming years. For example, despite a number of domestic and regional initiatives, the global capital markets continue to lack specific policy direction and clarity from policymakers about the best way forward. Options abound, each with its own trade-offs and challenges. These range from a standardized mechanism for pricing carbon, to consistent taxonomies for \"sustainable\" investing, to specific pathways for aligning with the agreed upon goals of the Paris Agreement. Governments, companies, and financial market participants also lack a single global standard for climate risk reporting, which could provide stakeholders with information that is consistent, comparable, and therefore more useful for decision-making. Given the global impact of climate risk, we are hopeful that governments will act individually and collectively with these long-term realities in mind.\\nAt Vanguard, we know we don\\'t have all the answers. But we do understand how to help long-term investors manage risk and meet their financial goals—and that\\'s how we approach this challenge for our clients.\\nInvesting and engaging\\nAs a fiduciary, Vanguard views climate risk, like other risks, through the lens of financial materiality for long-term investors. Our investment stewardship teams have ongoing engagements about climate risk with the companies our funds invest in, particularly as our index funds are near-permanent shareholders on behalf of our 30 million investors. (By design, an index fund will hold the shares of a company for as long as it is included in the benchmark index.)\\nThrough engagements with company boards and management—and through proxy voting on behalf of Vanguard\\'s internally managed equity funds—Vanguard\\'s Investment Stewardship team encourages companies to have sound risk management practices, including with respect to climate risk. For companies where climate risk is a material risk, this includes effective oversight of climate risk at the board level, risk mitigation targets that are aligned with the Paris Agreement, and disclosure of progress against those risk mitigation targets.\\nOn behalf of investors in our index equity funds, we must stay invested in constituent companies.\\xa0 We believe that encouraging these companies to take positive action on material climate risks can deliver long-term sustainable value and real economic impacts. This approach can be more effective than (1) divesting from these companies by selling them to other owners who may be less interested in sustainable, long-term value creation; or (2) investing solely in green start-ups.\\nOur approach boils down to a belief that responding to risk, including climate risk, requires a responsible, long-term perspective—and we do not believe wholesale divestment is a productive way to safeguard the long-term investment returns of our clients. Vanguard Investment Stewardship regularly publishes perspectives, policies, and reports to keep investors informed of our approach and activities.\\nProviding information and choices for our investors\\nAt Vanguard, our investors are our owners and they always come first.2 We aim to provide investors with the insights they need to make well-informed decisions. We believe that investors are best served by diversified portfolios that include appropriate allocations to the broad global stock and bond markets. For some investors, however, owning certain companies is not consistent with their values or preferences. This is particularly true in the context of climate change, which is why we offer passively managed environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds that enable investors to avoid companies in the fossil fuel value chain.\\nThere are also investors who prefer to invest in companies with leading sustainability practices. For them, we offer actively managed funds that choose to invest in companies deemed to have leading ESG practices.\\nIn addition, given the growing importance of climate risk, many managers of our other active funds—even those that don\\'t explicitly target sustainability—take ESG factors, including climate risk, into consideration in their engagement practices and security selection because these factors can materially impact a company\\'s future revenue and liabilities. We believe this is just good risk management.\\nAdvocating for responsible action on climate risk\\nOver the years, we have worked with a number of organizations that encourage collaborative and constructive dialogue across our industry to safeguard long-term shareholder returns and encourage responsible action on climate change.\\nThey include the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), an organization we’ve supported since 2017. TCFD advocates for constructive climate-change disclosure practices that will help investors understand the material financial impacts of climate-related risks associated with the companies in which they invest. Such disclosures are making climate change a more prominent consideration in the business and investment decisions that companies make.\\nLast year, we joined the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. It consists of more than 200 global asset managers committed to supporting policymakers\\' stated goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner. As part of our commitment, Vanguard has pledged to engage with companies, policymakers, and other investment industry participants about this transition; publish annual TCFD disclosures to report on our progress; and provide Vanguard investors with information on net zero investing so they can make informed asset -allocation decisions.\\nDoing our part as a company\\nFinally, as a company of more than 18,000 employees in locations around the world, Vanguard has embraced our own sustainability goals. They include using 100% renewable energy, a milestone we first achieved in 2021, and reaching carbon neutrality throughout our own global operations in 2025.\\nOur corporate sustainability strategy balances growth and efficiency. To achieve carbon neutrality, we use a combination of tactics—operational enhancements to reduce our carbon emissions, investment in the sustainability of our global real estate portfolio, and the purchase of renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets.\\nWe will continue to report on progress against our corporate sustainability strategy, and on our efforts across Vanguard\\'s operations to address the risks of climate change.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The more popular ETFs become, the more important it is that investors use the right trading strategies. That\\'s particularly true of large trades, which can be quite complex and, if mishandled, can create negative consequences for advisors and client portfolios.\\nOne category of large trades that our ETF Capital Markets Desk gets a lot of calls about is rebalancing trades. Rebalancing trades recur regularly with the calendar—say, quarterly—or when markets are volatile. Advisors often ask how they can minimize transaction costs as they rebalance clients\\' ETF portfolios to achieve their targeted allocations.\\nWe understand the concern, because as investors continue to shift to ETFs, larger block trades are hitting the market more frequently.1 This means that getting the trading piece right is more important than ever.\\nIndustry mutual fund and ETF assets and net cash flows, 2012–2021\\nNotes: Mutual fund data are as of December 31, 2021, and exclude money market funds and funds-of-funds. 10-year net flows data cover 2012 through 2021.\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from Morningstar, Inc.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBig trades and small trades\\nJust as carpenters have unique tools in their toolbox for specific jobs, investors have different trading strategies at their disposal for different transactions.\\nWe want to equip you with the right tools so you can execute your next ETF order and incur the lowest transaction costs possible.\\nFirst, and crucially, big and small ETF trades are not handled the same way. We\\'ll distinguish between what we call \"low-touch\" and \"high-touch\" trades.\\nUsing the correct order type\\nGenerally, low-touch order types are used for smaller ETF trades, and high-touch order types are used for larger ETF block trades that could affect the ETF\\'s price.2 Broadly, low-touch trades can be self-provisioned by executing either limit orders or market orders. High-touch trades often require working with your custodian\\'s block trading desk to execute the ETF order with greater discretion.\\nLow-touch and high-touch ETF trades defined\\nLow-touch—common ETF order types\\n\\nMarket order: An order to buy or sell a security immediately at the best available current price. The priorities for this type of order are speed and execution, not price. These are popular among individual investors who want to buy or sell ETFs without delay. The primary risk associated with this order type is price impact.\\nLimit order: An order to buy or sell a security at no more or less than a specified price. This gives the investor some control over the price at which the trade is executed and can safeguard against unexpected market volatility.\\nMarketable limit order: A limit order that is placed for immediate execution. For a marketable buy limit order, the limit price is set at or above the Ask. For a marketable sell limit order, the limit price is set at or below the Bid.\\n\\nHigh-touch—common ETF order types\\n\\nRisk trade: A trade done with a market maker at a negotiated price for a block of ETF shares, where the market maker commits capital to facilitate the client\\'s order immediately. Generally, trades occur at a slight premium or discount to the quoted spread (NBBO) at the time of the trade.\\nAlgorithmic trades (algos): Trading strategies that use automated algorithms to try to achieve specific execution outcomes. Generally, trades are executed over a period of time and intended to minimize price impact in the market.\\n\\nVWAP trade—volume-weighted average price.\\nTWAP trade—time-weighted average price.\\nPOV trade—percent of volume.\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding whether to use low-touch or high-touch order types depends on how big your planned trade is compared with the ETF\\'s liquidity profile. If the amount exceeds 5% of the ETF\\'s average daily volume, it\\'s important to pause to reflect on a few other considerations before submitting any kind of order. You may have experience submitting low-touch market orders in this scenario, but before doing so again, consider our preference for marketable limit orders. These are limit orders priced for immediate execution.3\\nBefore submitting a marketable limit order for a relatively large trade, though, make sure—whether you\\'re buying or selling—that enough shares are available in the secondary market to readily absorb the trade. So if you\\'re selling, the shares you plan to sell should not greatly exceed the shares on the bid, and if you\\'re buying, the shares you plan to buy should not greatly outsize the number of shares on the offer. If the size of your order greatly outsizes the market, you could potentially show too much information to the market, which could work against your execution quality.\\nIf the trade is much larger than the quoted size in the secondary market, you might still be able to execute a low-touch trade in the form of a not held limit order. Not held limit orders allow you to stipulate the price at which you\\'re willing to execute the trade and protect against unintentional price impact, while not revealing the full size of your trade to the market. So if bids or offers don\\'t materialize at your desired price, the trade won\\'t happen, thus avoiding any unexpected ETF executions.\\nBig trades often require high-touch orders\\nIf the trade size exceeds both 5% of average daily trading volume (ADV) and the quoted size available on the bid/offer, you may have to consider whether your order is large enough to result in the creation or redemption of ETF shares.4 If your ETF trade meets these criteria, you may want to consider working with your custodian\\'s block trading desk to execute the trade using a high-touch order type.\\nETF trading decision tree\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe power of order aggregation\\nWe occasionally see the same trading style applied to ETFs that was previously used for mutual fund portfolios—submitting batch orders all at once at the same time each day.5 Although this works for mutual funds priced once a day at the fund\\'s net asset value (NAV), it may not be the best solution for ETFs. Rebalancing numerous clients\\' portfolios and submitting countless low-touch trades for a single ETF at the same time runs the risk of affecting the ETF\\'s price and resulting in higher transaction costs for your end-clients.\\nOne useful trading technique that can make rebalancing ETF portfolios across numerous client accounts more efficient is ETF order aggregation—the simple concept of taking numerous orders on the same ETF and same side of the market and aggregating them into a single trade.\\nNot only does this minimize the operational challenges of submitting multiple trades across various client accounts, but it also provides more trade flexibility in using high-touch orders to help achieve the best execution.\\nTakeaways\\nThe great benefit of intraday trading should be balanced with the right trading strategy.\\nAs the use of ETFs increases and larger trades become more frequent, advisors have an opportunity to perfect how they approach big trades such as rebalancing trades. Advisors who weigh different trade considerations carefully to avoid any surprises and achieve the best execution can potentially increase the chances for optimal client outcomes.\\nVanguard\\'s ETF Capital Markets team is available to assist in trading and execution throughout the decision-making process, increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome. If you\\'re expanding your ETF business, consider reaching out to our Capital Markets Desk and using the ETF decision framework to avoid an unexpected ETF execution.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Market participants don\\'t always agree on what constitutes a block trade. Some exchanges define block trades as any trade over 10,000 shares, which can diverge from custodians\\' requirements. Each custodian\\'s definition of a block trade may differ and is often tied to the percentage of the ADV, share quantity, or dollar value of the trade.\\n2 Low-touch orders refer to \"held orders\" that are held to the national best bid and offer (NBBO) price. High-touch orders give your broker time and price discretion to execute the order and aim to achieve the best price available. They are also called \"not held\" orders since they are not held to the NBBO.\\n3 Vanguard\\'s ETF Capital Markets Desk typically suggests that investors consider using limit orders or marketable limit orders to avoid any unexpected ETF executions. In our view, marketable limit orders may represent the best of both worlds in that executions are quick and include safeguards that market orders lack.\\n4 ETFs are created and redeemed in unit sizes. Generally, 25,000 ETF shares is the minimum to facilitate a creation or redemption; however, creation unit size can vary by product.\\n5 Batch orders refer to the systematic submission of numerous low-touch (held) orders to the market all at once. This trading strategy can often affect the ETF price and signal the market if the trades are consistently submitted at the same time of day.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or ETF Shares, contact your financial advisor to obtain a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus. Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other important information are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing.\\nVanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of a client\\'s account.

       "  'content': \"These days, you are no doubt talking to clients about what to do with the fixed income allocation in their portfolios.\\nConcerns about central banks' policy normalization in the face of high global inflation and market volatility, along with a rising interest rate environment, have combined to make the fixed income decisions you make for your clients tougher than ever.\\nStick with your plan … especially when it comes to bonds\\nThe benefits of bonds are timeless. They provide a buffer against equity market fluctuations, while producing income that can grow from the compounding effect of reinvested interest payments. It would be unusual indeed to have a portfolio without them.\\nAs you meet the challenges of creating thoughtful, well-diversified fixed income allocations for your clients, here are four strategies to keep in mind.\\n1. Stay diversified\\nBe clear on the role of fixed income in your clients' portfolios. Your clients should own bond funds as a diversifier to equity risk—even with interest rates moving higher. The chart below shows projected returns of various assets during the expected worst decile of monthly U.S. equity performance over the next 10 years.\\nBonds are still expected to cushion volatility\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. Distribution of return outcomes from VCMM are derived from 10,000 simulations for each modeled asset class. Simulations are as of December 31, 2021. Results from the model may vary with each use and over time.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2. Maintain a proper risk profile\\nLately, many advisors have chosen to shorten duration in order to reduce their clients' interest rate risk exposure, filling the yield gap with high-yield or emerging markets fixed income securities, for example, thus increasing credit risk. This may look great on paper, as these sectors are expected to earn, on average, higher returns. However, this approach can lead to a more equity-like fixed income portfolio that may not perform as well during a stock market correction or bear market.\\n3. Harness duration\\nAlthough it's a seemingly obvious decision, it's worth repeating: Construct portfolios tailored to the appropriate time horizon.\\nEven rising rates can be good for bond investors if their investing time horizon is longer than the portfolio's average duration. Higher yields on reinvested cash flow should outweigh market price declines. There may be some short-term pain, but your clients should be rewarded over time. If the investment horizon is shorter than the average duration of the portfolio, consider adjusting it to align the two more closely.\\n4. Take control\\nHow you implement the fixed income allocation of your client portfolios depends on how much control you want to have. You may choose to have full strategic control and make allocation decisions across the different sectors in fixed income. Alternatively, you might choose to hire an investment manager to do this for you. Or, depending on your expertise, you may choose to do something in the middle.\\nWhat's the bottom line?\\nFixed income investing is challenging these days. But it's not just fixed income investments that face headwinds in the markets. The next 10 years are probably not going to look like the last 10 years for any asset class.\\nWe believe maintaining portfolio diversification and the right risk profile, harnessing duration, and taking appropriate control of allocations can go a long way in helping you position your clients to achieve success.\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more?\\nVisit our special active fixed income webpage for a wealth of resources.View webpage\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. VCMM results will vary with each use and over time.\\nThe VCMM projections are based on a statistical analysis of historical data. Future returns may behave differently from the historical patterns captured in the VCMM. More important, the VCMM may be underestimating extreme negative scenarios unobserved in the historical period on which the model estimation is based.\\nThe Vanguard Capital Markets Model is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguard's primary investment research and advice teams. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.\\nDiversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.\\nInvestments in bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.\\nHigh-yield bonds generally have medium- and lower-range credit quality ratings and are therefore subject to a higher level of credit risk than bonds with higher credit quality ratings.\\nInvestments in bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk. These risks are especially high in emerging markets.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'You\\'ve probably gotten a number of questions from your clients about personalized indexing (PI), also known as direct indexing, and its potential benefits. Interest in PI is certainly on the rise. Assets managed with a PI strategy grew more than threefold between 2015 and 2021, from $100 billion to roughly $350 billion—a pace that is expected to accelerate, with total assets managed with PI estimated to reach $1.5 trillion by 2025.1\\nBut the rising adoption of personalized indexing by mass-affluent and high-net-worth investors, and the sheer number of PI options available in today\\'s marketplace, raise many questions. Recent Vanguard research addresses two critical questions about using a PI strategy:\\xa0\\n\\nWhat\\'s the difference between similar PI implementations, including tax-loss harvesting (TLH) frequency?\\nHow can you help your clients incorporate PI into their portfolios, and how much personalization can they pursue without potentially lowering their expected returns?\\n\\nThe impact of tax-loss harvesting\\nPersonalized indexing strategies use tax-loss harvesting to help investors potentially earn better returns. Rather than owning a pooled product like an ETF or a mutual fund, investors own individual stocks that represent an index, such as the CRSP US Total Market Index, in separately managed accounts (SMAs).\\nPI software scans the portfolio for TLH opportunities at a set frequency, such as quarterly or monthly. Securities that drop below their cost basis are sold, and correlated (but not \"substantially identical\") replacement stocks are immediately repurchased to navigate the wash-sale rule.2\\xa0 This way, investors may capture the gains of the chosen index while harvesting losses that can offset capital gains at tax time.\\nTax-loss harvesting frequency matters\\nA key difference between personalized indexing implementations is how often they scan for tax-loss harvesting opportunities, ranging from once a year to daily. Our research found that more frequent scans lead to materially higher and more consistent loss harvesting. The differences in TLH alpha can be wide, ranging from 20 basis points (bps) to well over 100 bps for a prime PI investor with extensive recurring capital gains.3 Personalized indexing with daily tax-loss harvesting is critical to achieving the maximum harvest in \"typical\" (non-high) volatility environments.\\nAverage 10-year TLH alpha by harvest frequency\\n(Ultra-high-net-worth investor)*\\xa0\\n*Assumes quarterly contributions.\\nSource: Kevin Khang, Alan Cummings, Thomas Paradise, and Brennan O’Connor, 2022. Personalized indexing: A portfolio construction plan. Valley Forge, Pa.: The Vanguard Group.\\xa0\\nThe figure shows the average 10-year TLH alpha for each mode for UHNW investors. For UHNW investors with unlimited loss-offsetting income, TLH alpha rises from 1.64% for \"PI annually” to 3.10% for \"PI daily\"—a significant difference of 1.46%.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBuilding personalized indexing portfolios\\nA personalized indexing portfolio is an SMA based on a chosen market-capitalization-weighted benchmark. Investors can personalize their accounts to incorporate desired factors; tilts; and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or socially responsible investing (SRI) preferences or to account for concentrated positions.\\nA PI portfolio is flexible, but such \"active\" customizations typically run a tracking error between 75 bps and 275 bps, with 75 bps representing the minimum level of tracking error that can result from TLH using individual securities and navigating the wash-sale rule. Additional personalization for ESG and/or factors can cause tracking error to rise to 275 bps.4\\nHow much tracking error is too much?\\nAs our research points out, recommendations for how much personalization investors can pursue without sacrificing performance vary sharply by investor profile and PI alpha potential (a highly predictable quantity based on the investor\\'s capital gains profile). Investors with an expected PI alpha of 150 bps or more can largely replace their existing passive U.S. equity allocation with PI and personalize it freely,5 that is, up to 275 bps of tracking error, without having to change their overall asset allocation.\\xa0\\nFor investors with an expected PI alpha below 150 bps, however, personalization in PI may come at a cost. First, greater tracking error in PI calls for a lower allocation to equity and therefore a lower expected return from the entire portfolio. Second, as tracking error rises above 75 bps and the optimal equity allocation declines, the optimal mix between PI and passive may also change. Investors may want to lower their overall equity allocation to accommodate meaningful personalization in the personalized indexing portfolio.\\nExplore Vanguard Personalized Indexing\\nIf you have clients who could benefit from the tax optimization and customization features of personalized indexing, consider Vanguard Personalized Indexing (VPI).

Vanguard\\'s quits rate forecast is through December 31, 2022.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAs the chart above shows, quits rates have been low when economies have been weak, such as during the global financial crisis and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. People typically don\\'t leave jobs if they don\\'t already have another lined up or are pessimistic about the economy, Schickling noted. Quits rates have been correspondingly higher in stronger economies.\\nThe pandemic sent millions of older workers into an earlier-than-anticipated retirement, one of several reasons for the labor shortage that is adding to inflationary concerns. Schickling expects only around 20% of those early retirees to return to the workforce this year and only around 40% ever to return, exacerbating labor market tightness that creates the conditions for what has become known as the Big Quit, or the Great Resignation. Many of these retirees have realized they don\\'t need to return to work immediately, because they have accumulated savings (benefiting from elevated asset prices), their spouses still work, or they\\'re eligible for pensions or government benefits, he said.\\nAs job turnover has increased, so has compensation\\nNotes: Each dot represents a reading of the quits rate, taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\\' monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary, plotted against the corresponding month\\'s wages and salaries reading from the bureau\\'s Employment Cost Index. The five circled dots represent the most recent readings.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data through February 28, 2022.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThis chart shows the strong relationship between the quits rate and compensation. \"It\\'s very logical that higher rates of quitting are generally going to mean higher wage growth,\" Schickling said. \"Quitting is going to happen when the economy is strong. And when the economy is strong, employers are competing for labor.\"\\nSo the Federal Reserve, which is on record saying that a healthy labor market is contingent on price stability, may find its calculus governed by wage growth. \"If quits rates stay elevated throughout the rest of the year,\" Schickling said, \"we would expect nominal wage growth to stay around 5%, and that poses some challenge to breaking the dynamic of a wage-price spiral.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFragile—handle with care\\nBond returns plunged near record lows to begin 2022.

       "  'content': 'The recent flattening of the U.S. yield curve has left many investors wondering whether a recession is on the horizon and whether they should adjust their portfolios in response. But investors should not overreact, according to Andrew Patterson, senior international economist in Vanguard Investment Strategy Group, and John Madziyire, head of U.S. Treasuries/TIPS in Vanguard Fixed Income Group.\\n\"In the past, inversions of the yield curve have been reasonably reliable indicators of recession,\" Patterson said. \"But interpreting the signals can be challenging, particularly in an environment like this with so much uncertainty over inflation, Federal Reserve policy, the labor market, and now the war in Ukraine. Against this unusual backdrop, we need to be careful in drawing parallels to history.\"\\nYield curves normally slope upward because investors naturally demand a higher return for tying up their principal for longer periods. Longer-term bonds carry a greater risk of exposure to inflation. A steepening curve signals expectations for a healthy economy, whereas a flattening of the curve and, beyond that, an inversion reveal some concerns.\\nRecession isn\\'t a foregone conclusion\\nHistorically, an inverted yield curve—where the yield on longer-term Treasury bonds is lower than that of shorter-term Treasury bonds—has foreshadowed a recession in the next year or two. The inversion implies that investors\\' outlook for the economy over longer periods has deteriorated compared with their near-term views.\\nBut there are several other reasons why part of the yield curve has flattened. The Fed has embarked on quantitative easing (QE) during the last two interest rate cycles. The first came in response to the global financial crisis and the second to the COVID-19 pandemic. As shorter-term Treasury rates approached zero, the Fed could stimulate the economy only by lowering yields on the long end of the curve, thus creating a flatter curve.\\nIn the post-COVID cycle, accelerated QE plus strong demand for Treasuries from overseas markets and pension funds have helped drive down longer-term yields.\\nNow the uncertainty over how much the Fed will continue to tighten monetary policy is flattening the curve, this time by short-term rates rising more than longer-term rates. \"The Federal Reserve has already signaled its plans to raise rates above the neutral rate to about 2.75%,\" Madziyire said. \"The risk is that with inflation already running at a 40-year high, the Fed may have to raise rates higher than anticipated.\"\\nThe result has been a rapid narrowing of spreads between 2-year and 10-year Treasury bonds, to just 6 basis points on March 29.1\\n\"With the Fed just starting to raise the federal funds rate, a 6-basis-point spread is significantly narrower than normal at this early stage of the cycle,\" Madziyire said. \"Many investors may think a recession is a foregone conclusion.\"\\nThe spread between the 2-year and 10-year Treasuries is at historic lows at this stage of the rate hike cycle\\nNote: A spread is the difference between the yield of a bond with one maturity compared with a bond of another maturity.\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data as of March 1, 2022, from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the National Bureau of Economic Research.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBut Madziyire noted that yield curve inversions have typically happened further into an economic expansion when rates were already relatively high.\\nPatterson echoed the point: \"Today we\\'re talking about inversions when the federal funds rate remains very close to zero, certainly below anything most people would estimate to be a neutral rate,\" he said.2\\nThe spread between 3-month and 10-year Treasuries may be a better indicator of an economic slowdown—and that spread isn\\'t sending recessionary signals, Patterson said.\\n\"Because the 3-month Treasury is much shorter than the 2-year, it is much more sensitive to Fed policy and reflective of current economic conditions, so its narrowing spread with the 10-year is generally a better indicator of potential recessions,\" he said. \"The 3-month/10-year spread has actually widened in recent weeks, and the yield curve has steepened at the shorter end.\"\\nMixed signals from a rising, flattening yield curve\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhat investors might do next\\nMadziyire said he and his team have been overweighting 10-year bonds and underweighting 2-year bonds. \"Given the expected market reaction to the recent and upcoming Fed moves, we expect the rate at which the 2-year goes up to be faster than the rate at which the 10-year bond rises,\" he said.\\nHe added that investors should continue to hold fixed income in their portfolios despite the short-term challenges associated with a rising rate environment. Short-duration bond portfolios will do relatively well in a diversified portfolio in such an environment because they are less sensitive to rising rates. But even when stock returns and bond returns decline in tandem, bonds provide diversification benefits, as the magnitude of losses in fixed income portfolios is often significantly less than that of stocks.\\nRising interest rates can be good for bond investors and savers, as current and future income benefits from being reinvested at higher rates.\\n\"Fixed income investors may feel some pain in the short term,\" Madziyire said. \"But if you are a long-term investor, higher yields mean more income.\"\\n\\xa0\\n1 A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\\n2 The neutral rate is typically defined as the equilibrium federal funds rate at which policy is putting neither upward nor downward pressure on the economy.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nFragile—handle with care\\nBond returns plunged near record lows to begin 2022.

       "  'content': 'Vanguard has emphasized for months that markets have underestimated just how high the Federal Reserve might need to raise its key interest rate target to quell inflation. Our economic and market outlook for 2022 discussed policymakers\\' delicate balance between keeping inflation expectations anchored and supporting economic growth.\\nConsumer prices that have since reached multidecade highs globally, exacerbated recently by elevated oil prices related to Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, have attuned markets to the reality that inflation won\\'t come down magically.\\nCentral banks no doubt have a challenge ahead. We believe the Fed will eventually need to raise the federal funds rate target to 3%, if not higher. Yet we also believe that higher interest rates will cool, but not stop, labor market strength and economic growth. And the recently begun normalization of monetary policy will bring with it a normalization of asset returns, restoring balance to financial markets that lately have relied too heavily on increasing valuations of large growth stocks.\\nYears of accommodative policy are coming to an end\\nNotes: Vanguard\\'s proprietary monetary policy measurement examines the effect of the policy rate, central bank asset purchases, and inflation relative to the neutral rate of interest to gauge how \"tight\" or \"loose\" policy is.

Lofty valuations have no doubt been part of that story for our equity forecasts, but more so, it has been the near- or below-zero real interest rates that have encouraged investors to pay more now for future expected cash flows.\\nFor several years, we\\'ve talked about the role of secular forces such as globalization and technology in keeping interest rates and inflation low. Central banks have found themselves challenged, since the global financial crisis, to push inflation up toward 2% targets. For much of that time, their concern has been deflation, not inflation.\\nAnd for several years, central banks have had reason to keep borrowing terms easy, the most recent and pronounced being the need to support economies that the COVID-19 pandemic had shut down. Recent high inflation caused by lingering pandemic supply constraints and surging demand—especially for workers—accentuates a needed end to accommodative policy.\\nCOVID-19\\'s legacy won\\'t be persistently higher inflation\\nHigher interest rates may bring volatility. The segments of the equity market that have benefited from low interest rates—U.S. stocks, especially large-capitalization and growth stocks—reached valuations not justified by their fundamentals and now face headwinds. But other equity market segments—such as small-cap, value, and developed markets outside the United States—appear fairly valued in a still-growing economy. Although the values of existing bonds decline as rates rise, coupons of new bonds will pay at higher, healthier rates.\\nWe believe that central banks will do the hard work necessary to bring inflation back toward target levels in the years ahead.

       "  'content': \"Today, a growing number of your clients wish to invest in companies that reflect their values, especially with respect to social and sustainability issues.\\nFund providers have met—and in many ways fueled—this demand for sustainable investments by launching a flurry of products that include ESG considerations in their investment processes. Although many of these funds wear the “ESG” label, they can vary widely in their objectives, strategies, and levels of complexity. The proliferation of ESG products and approaches, along with a lack of standardized terminology to describe them, has been a growing source of confusion.\\nUnderstand the methodology behind various ESG product approaches \\nWhether they’re managed actively or passively, ESG funds generally fall into one of two categories based on their approach: exclusionary or inclusionary. Exclusionary ESG funds use screens to exclude sectors, countries, or companies that do not align with certain ESG criteria. Inclusionary ESG funds aim to include companies that meet certain ESG standards based on ESG ratings, data, and/or the asset managers' proprietary assessments.\\nAs the ESG market is still evolving, there is no universally accepted taxonomy for ESG funds. Even so, the four categories described here are a useful starting point for understanding the types of ESG funds that are available today.\\n\\xa0\\nFour categories of ESG products1\\n\\xa0\\n\\nExclusionary. These funds aim to track an index that excludes sectors or industries based on their business involvement or activities. Examples can include oil companies, weapons manufacturers, chemical companies, alcohol producers, tobacco companies, and companies that do not meet minimum human rights standards.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nInclusionary. These funds can be managed passively or actively. Passive inclusionary funds aim to track an index that includes companies based on ESG ratings, the criteria of the index provider, and/or the proprietary assessment of the asset manager. Actively managed inclusionary funds explicitly look at ESG factors to identify the potential for maximizing long-term financial value. They may employ some level of top-down sector screen, but they predominantly use bottom-up evaluation techniques that focus on a company’s business fundamentals. As with all active funds, these come with active risk. Since inclusionary funds vary widely in how they assess ESG criteria and in the ESG outcomes they aim to achieve, investors should take time to evaluate the security selection process of active products and the index construction process of passive products.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nImpact. This type of inclusionary fund has an explicit dual mandate: to produce a measurable positive financial return and a measurable positive environmental or social impact. The manager documents both the returns of the portfolio and any positive ESG impact achieved. These funds are typically actively managed, so they come with active risk. What’s more, their dual mandate can require additional due diligence to determine whether they are delivering the positive impact their investors seek.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThematic. This type of inclusionary fund can be managed passively or actively. Passive thematic funds are designed to track an index made up of companies whose businesses support specific ESG themes. Examples include clean tech, green real estate, sustainable forestry, organic agriculture, education, and health care. Index thematic funds are typically less diversified than non-thematic ESG index funds and can be highly complex in how they are managed and maintained. Active thematic funds aim to beat market returns by investing in companies within a given theme, such as climate change, social justice issues, or equitable pay policies. Active thematic funds come with active risk and require due diligence to understand the security selection process.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nESG investing is not a one-size-fits-all solution\\n\\xa0\\nWhen employed thoughtfully and with an appreciation for their many nuances, ESG products can offer your clients a way to reach their financial goals while staying true to their values. Certain types of ESG funds may even be able to achieve a quantifiable positive impact in a particular area of social or environmental concern.\\n\\xa0\\nThat said, ESG investing is not a one-size-fits-all solution. When selecting an ESG fund consideration should be given to how it fits into a client’s broader financial plan, the potential advantages and limitations of the strategy the fund employs, and a realistic expectation for any ESG outcomes they hope to achieve.\\n\\xa0\\n1 This information is intended for educational purposes for investors. These are examples of general strategy and criteria that can be used for ESG investing. The advisors of Vanguard ESG funds may not apply this same strategy or criteria. Vanguard does not currently employ all of these methods. Please refer to a fund’s disclosure documents for additional details on the specific fund strategies.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'Updated April 29, 2022\\nInvestors with bond-centric portfolios are likely feeling fragile after unusually poor first-quarter returns. Here are a few tips for handling them with care.\\n\\nThe first-quarter 2022 market downturn squeezed equity and fixed income asset classes alike. This less common market event of both negative stock and bond returns likely affected all investors, but its impact may have gained special notice from conservative, bond-centric investors because they also have the highest loss aversion.\\nYou might find it beneficial to reach out proactively to your most conservatively invested clients, as they may be less accustomed to simultaneous stock and bond drawdowns of the magnitude we just witnessed.\\nAs their advisor, you\\'ve spent a great deal of time building a strong relationship with your clients to gain their trust and develop a thoughtful financial plan. One unfavorable quarter should not trigger a change to that plan if it was appropriate going into the year. Educating your clients on the frequency and magnitude of these types of events—and keeping their long-term objectives in focus—can help them maintain perspective and stay committed to their plan.\\n\\nPerhaps you remember as a kid trying to play the piano, throw a ball, or some other activity that required more developed motor skills. If so, you likely also remember how one side or muscle became much stronger and more adept than the other. Similarly, as an investment behavioral coach, you\\'ve possibly grown quite proficient in helping your more aggressively allocated, equity-centric clients \"stay the course\" in equity bear markets.\\nBut like a right-footed soccer player who has the chance to score the winning goal—with his left foot—advisors are now being confronted with the need to conduct unfamiliar conversations with their most conservatively invested, bond-centric clients.\\nThat\\'s because, generally speaking, bonds have experienced a 40-year bull market—there\\'s seldom been bad news to communicate, but the first quarter of 2022 delivered some of history\\'s worst bond returns, in addition to negative stock returns. This year\\'s first-quarter drawdown of –5.9% ranks as the third-worst quarter for bonds in the last 50 years.1 As a result, for the first time in a long time, you will likely need to place greater emphasis on coaching your more conservatively invested clients.\\nThese more loss-averse investors may feel an elevated state of anxiety and unease—and will need to be approached with care and empathy. Following, we provide some context on how this unusual quarter shaped up, along with a few pointers to help guide your conversations with clients.\\nBuckle up—conservative investors likely to find the quarter unsettling\\nTypically, the greatest pain in a portfolio comes to those investors more heavily weighted toward equities and other risky assets. However, in the first quarter of 2022 both stocks and bonds had negative returns—so, conservative investors have experienced a drawdown that is much less common for them. In fact, bond returns for the quarter were worse than stocks. In the past 50 years, an investor with a 30/70 stock/bond mix has only experienced three worse quarters.1\\nThis differs markedly from the experience of a more aggressive 70/30 investor.\\xa0 They\\'ve experienced similar or worse quarterly performance 23 times, or, on average, every two to three years. Said a different way, the conservative 30/70 investor just experienced a return of –5.7% that would rank near the bottom percentile over the last 50 years.1  To put that in context, the same percentile loss for a more aggressive 70/30 investor would be a much larger –13.0%;2  instead, the first quarter of 2022 saw the 70/30 investor \"only\" experience a –5.5% drawdown (see chart below).\\nFor your conservatively invested clients, it\\'s a matter of helping them put things into perspective. Historically speaking—yes, bonds saw one of their worst quarters. But comparatively speaking, when equities are in a bear market, they tend to fare much worse. Also, you can point out that this type of performance from bonds has, so far, proven exceedingly rare.\\nA tale of two return profiles—mostly bonds versus mostly stocks\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nNotes: The 30% stock/70% bond and 70% stock/30% bond portfolios comprise the Spliced US Bond and Spliced US Equity return series, weighted according to their respective stock and bond allocations. Bond portion of portfolios is composed of Spliced US Bonds, as represented by IA SBBI U.S. Intermediate-Term Government Bond Index from April 1 to December 31, 1972; Bloomberg U.S. Government/Credit Intermediate-Term Index from January 1, 1973, to December 31, 1975; and Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index thereafter. Stock portion of portfolios is composed of Spliced US Equity as represented by the FT Willshire 5000 Index from April 1, 1972, to June 30, 1994; MSCI USA Investable Market Index from July 1, 1994, to June 30, 2001; and CRSP US Total Market Index thereafter.\\nSources: Vanguard analysis of Morningstar Direct data, as of March 31, 2022.\\n\\nBond yields have risen in the past two years\\nAs shown below, during 2020, the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields were as low as 0.12% and 0.62% respectively, and at the end of the first quarter sat at 2.28% and 2.32%, respectively.\\xa0 Most of history has shown that remaining committed to one’s investment plan is likely a much better alternative to additional de-risking (such as moving further into bonds or money markets). This especially applies in real purchasing power terms. So, in addition to managing drawdown risk from the markets, the advisor and client should together balance and manage purchasing power risk—that is, the risk the investment portfolio does not keep up with inflation over a long time horizon.\\nIncrease in interest rates has led to higher current yields on fixed income\\nU.S. Treasury securities yields since mid-2019\\nNotes: Chart depicts the 3-month U.S. Treasury security yield, as represented by the market yield on U.S. Treasury securities at 3-month constant maturity; the 2-year U.S. Treasury security yield, as represented by the market yield on U.S. Treasury securities at 2-year constant maturity; and the 10-year U.S. Treasury security yield, as represented by the market yield on U.S. Treasury securities at 10-year constant maturity.\\nSources: Vanguard analysis of Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data, as of March 31, 2022.\\n\\nAs we know, when the financial markets are volatile, investors can feel strongly compelled to change their financial plan and their stated portfolio asset allocations to stem any perceived continued losses. Yet, it is often the case that staying the course is the better path in the long term. Often this doesn\\'t mean standing still, but taking the action of rebalancing into the underperforming asset class. It\\'s most often best to stick to the long-term plan that you and your client have built together, with changes being made because of changes in their goals, objectives, risk appetite, and other aspects of their life, not because of changes in the markets.\\nGetting the message across\\nFor some clients, the dynamics contributing to 2022\\'s disappointing first-quarter performance will seem evident and understandable. For others, especially those who viewed fixed income investments as drama-free safe havens, their quarterly statements may come as a shock.\\nWe recommend taking a proactive approach and reaching out to clients, if possible, before they call you. Here we offer a few guiding principles to help you structure your conversations:\\n\\nCommunicate from a place of empathy. Putting yourself in their shoes, you understand that investing in bonds has historically provided their capital with shelter from much of the volatility more common to riskier equities. You have an opportunity to put this atypical bond-market event into context for them—before conversations with their friends and family or reading news headlines prompts them to question their long-term investing plan.\\nTake care to avoid promissory statements. While your goal is to provide comfort and understanding, you also want to give clients a realistic picture about the future. And the truth is, none of us knows for certain what the future holds for the markets (thus, you\\'d do well to avoid statements such as, \"No need to worry, because the bond market has bottomed\"). You can think of every interaction with your clients as the opportunity to build or lose trust, credibility, and authenticity; it\\'s like a bank where you are depositing or withdrawing trust. Candor is a net contributor to your trust balance with clients.\\nFocus on the relationship between long-term risk and return premiums. Historically, stocks have provided higher returns than bonds or cash but have carried a higher degree of risk. If investors were not compensated for the additional risk they took over longer time periods, no one would buy the higher-risk assets. Such market pressure pushes down the price of these assets to a level where risk is eventually adequately priced into the market. Bonds, in turn, should also over longer periods provide higher returns and carry greater risk than cash. Again, you can remind clients that portfolio asset allocation balances principal risk and purchasing power risk—the risk that their balances lose value to inflation.\\n\\nProactively sharing how unique the quarter has been, while providing your empathy, care, and counseling, can go a long way toward helping your clients stick to their financial plans and keep their long-term goals on track.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Vanguard calculations using data from Morningstar, Inc., as of March 31, 2022.\\n2 Given recent concerns about rising inflation, we performed the same analysis using quarterly real returns (inflation adjusted) and found that results were largely consistent.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.\\nBond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time, and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer\\'s ability to make payments. Investments in bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.\\nDiversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Should investors adjust their portfolios in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve enacting the first in what is likely to be a series of interest rate hikes? For most investors, the answer will be no, other than regular rebalancing. But history shows that certain sub-asset classes have consistently outperformed during rising real rate environments.\\n\"Our research suggests that the current environment may present opportunities for those investors who have the ability and willingness to take some active risk and be a little more targeted in their approach,\" said Ian Kresnak, an investment strategist at Vanguard and a member of the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM) research team.1\\nRare conditions prompt action\\nKresnak noted that we are in an unusual market and economic environment, which is likely to mean that the Fed will raise interest rates over the coming years to levels not seen since before the global financial crisis. Although the recent events in Ukraine and uncertainty about the effects policy normalization will have on the broader economy raise the risk that rates may not rise as much as we anticipate, it is unlikely that they will stay at or below current levels due to high inflation rates.\\nThis environment is likely to lead to rising real interest rates, which differ from nominal interest rates in that real rates are adjusted to remove the effects of inflation. The VCMM team investigated how some sub-asset classes performed during rising real rate environments and what drove performance. Given Vanguard\\'s expectation that the Fed may raise the nominal rate to 3%, the team focused on similar periods with relatively large rate hikes that also led to spikes in real rates.\\nThe analysis examined a mix of economic environments during which real rate increases occurred, including during an improving economy in 1992–1994 and a period of low growth and low interest rates in 2014–2019.\\n\"It was important to include a wide range of economic cycles to capture as many of the conditions that exist today,\" Kresnak said. \"This allows us to get a better understanding of how and why different sub-asset classes performed.\"\\nThree key findings\\nThe team\\'s research resulted in three key findings:\\n\\nCertain sub-asset classes have consistently outperformed, and some have consistently underperformed. The chart below shows how 13 common sub-asset classes in investors\\' portfolios performed over six periods when real rates rose. The sub-asset classes that outperformed on average also tended to outperform across the six periods. The same was true for those sub-asset classes that on average underperformed, as they consistently underperformed across the different environments when real rates rose.\"Although it is not a perfect relationship, there is a clear pattern that exists between rising real rates and sub-asset class performance,\" Kresnak said. \"When real interest rates are rising, investors tend to prefer the certainty of more immediate cash flows in their equity portfolios, which is what we typically see in high-quality value stocks, the best-performing sub-asset class during rising real rate environments.\"The VCMM team found that the relationship between rising real rates and performance is stronger with bonds than with equities, given the more fixed nature of bonds\\' cash flows.\"Equity cash flows are more uncertain, and performance tends to be influenced more by other factors, such as the business environment,\" he said. \"In general, bonds tend to be adversely affected in a rising real rate environment.\"\\n\\nProlonged and persistent periods of real rate increases favor some sub-asset classes\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bloomberg; CRSP; Kenneth R. French\\'s website, at mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html; Robert Shiller\\'s website, at aida.wss.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm; Standard & Poor\\'s; MSCI; Dow Jones; and Russell, as of December 31, 2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\n\\n\\nRising real rates hedge inflation. Despite the current high inflation, it may not be advisable to overweight traditional inflation hedges such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and commodities, Kresnak said. “Traditional inflation hedges have typically underperformed when real interest rates rise, because policymakers are acting with the goal of bringing down inflation, and investors generally believe they will succeed,” he said.\\nThe growth environment is not a distinguishing factor. Rising real rates typically are associated with improving economic conditions and higher inflation. But they can also rise because of excessive monetary tightening or deflation, which causes economic conditions to contract.The chart below compares performance in a rising real rate environment when economic conditions are contracting and when they are improving. It clearly shows a positive slope for most sub-asset classes, suggesting that relative performance is similar whether the economy is expanding or contracting, as long as real rates are rising. If economic conditions were a key driver of relative performance, we would expect the dots to be positioned along the solid diagonal line sloping downward.The analysis revealed three notable outliers—emerging markets, commodities, and high-quality value. Vanguard research shows that valuations for emerging markets stocks are sensitive to local economic environments, which were expanding while the U.S. was beginning to slow in the run-up to the global financial crisis.2\\xa0 The unexpected behavior of commodity returns has more to do with the short-term impact of the late-1970s oil crisis. When that period is removed from the sample, commodity returns are less responsive to changing economic conditions. Finally, high-quality value stocks tend to outperform when economic conditions are strong because investors are less willing to pay a premium for growth when it is plentiful.\\n\\nEconomic conditions don’t matter for most sub-asset classes when real rates rise\\nNote: Each dot represents a sub-asset class listed in the first chart. The dots are plotted based on their historical relative performance rank when economic conditions are expanding and when they are contracting. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, as of December 31, 2021.\\n\\nThe analysis also looked at sub-asset class performance during periods of rising and falling real interest rates. The negative slope in the chart below suggests that changes in real rates are a significant factor in explaining relative performance.\\nThe real interest rate environment is a key determinant of sub-asset class performance\\nNote: Each dot represents a sub-asset class listed in the first chart. The dots are plotted based on their historical relative performance rank when real interest rates are rising and when they are falling. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations; as of December 31, 2021.\\n\\nKresnak added that many sub-asset classes that stand to gain in a rising real rate environment have been out of favor for years. As real rates increase, the risks are that active investors will stick with the best active decisions of the past decade and that passive investors will fail to rebalance.\\n\"The opportunity is that the sub-asset classes that stand to gain the most from normalizing policy are more attractively priced precisely because they underperformed in the last decade,\" he said. \"In that sense, both active and passive investors stand to benefit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nInsights on the current market environment\\nCheck out our market volatility hub for the latest updates for you and your clients.View our insights\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n1 The VCMM is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguard\\'s primary investment research and advice teams.

The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.'},\n",

Then to round out this \"Building of the Agg\" approach, you will need to include an allocation to Mortgage-backed securities through VMBS our mortgage-backed Securities ETF. This set of building blocks will provide you with 97% coverage of the total U.S. bond market.\\nHere are some things to consider when using bond ETFs to build out the fixed income allocation of an investor\\'s portfolio. The longer the average maturity, the more likely you\\'ll see prices move up and down when interest rates change. Credit quality helps assess the chance that the bond will default. The better the credit quality, the less risk there is to your investment, especially during times of economic stress. Investment-grade refers to bonds with higher ratings from rating agencies such as Moody\\'s and S&P.\\nWhichever way you choose to get your bond exposure, make sure you consider Vanguard Bond ETFs.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Editor\\'s note: This research is the product of a team of Vanguard corporate credit analysts affiliated with Vanguard\\'s active taxable bond funds. The team\\'s insights are included in portfolio managers\\' bond selection in Vanguard\\'s actively managed taxable bond funds.\\n\\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 led to a pivot in the health care industry to accommodate the development and rollout of vaccines and therapeutic remedies; address the need for testing, detection, and care; and combat multiple variants of the disease.\\nAt the same time, the pandemic has sped up many secular changes that were already underway, such as telehealth, virtual visits, and online pharmacy distribution. We expect these changes to influence many companies\\' capital allocation and acquisition strategies as they evaluate the impact of secular changes on their core business and look for ways to participate in new growth areas.\\nOur base case is that, over time, health care companies will see a return to pre-pandemic patient utilization levels while continuing to focus on research and development as well as capturing growth opportunities that will come with an aging population.\\n\\nHow health care credit has fared during the pandemic\\nIn general, companies in this sector have had to work through modest fluctuations in demand but have proven resilient throughout the course of the pandemic. Furthermore, while health care labor shortages and supply chain and inflationary pressures are real, ongoing issues, they have not resulted in material credit impacts for the sector overall.\\nPharmaceutical companies have held up particularly well, even in the early days of the pandemic. While many parts of the global economy effectively shut down for a short period of time and experienced a rapid and severe contraction in demand, pharmaceutical companies were able to continue manufacturing their products to meet the largely stable demand for drugs, especially from patients already on medications.\\nFurther, as COVID-19 spread, a number of pharmaceutical companies took the opportunity to research and develop vaccines and treatments such as remdesivir while the rest of their business remained largely unscathed. Then the emergence of variants spurred demand for boosters and new treatments, resulting in material financial benefits.\\nSimilarly, many life sciences companies found opportunities to realize material financial benefits from the pandemic, notably from COVID-19 testing.\\nThat said, uncertainty remains around the magnitude and duration of these benefits, which have not, for the most part, accrued directly to bondholders. However, the added financial flexibility provided by these tailwinds has changed our view of certain credits, particularly those that were already trading at relatively tight spreads.\\nMoreover, it hasn\\'t all been rosy for the sector. At the onset of the pandemic, for example, deferred procedures resulted in an unprecedented deterioration in earnings and cash flow. Given the critical nature of the products and services provided, however, demand bounced back relatively quickly and has remained generally stable, even with the emergence of new variants. In addition, actions taken by both federal and state governments, such as keeping Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled without eligibility redeterminations and providing liquidity to health care providers via loans and grants, provided stability to the sector.\\n\"The chart below shows that pharma sales, which tend to be fairly stable, actually increased significantly in 2021 due in large part to COVID tailwinds,\" said Vanguard senior research associate Victoria Drecchio. \"And even sales for medical devices, a subsector which has had to navigate more headwinds such as deferred procedures, health care labor shortages, and supply chain pressures, held up well, and its sales are coming out of the pandemic stronger than they were going into it.\"\\nSales for pharma and medical devices proved resilient during the pandemic\\nNote: The sales figures shown are the sum of the largest five companies by market capitalization within our coverage as of January 19, 2022.\\nSources: Bloomberg, Company Reports, and Vanguard.\\n\\nQuantifying the sector\\'s resiliency\\n\"As the charts below illustrate, spreads of securities issued by health care and pharma companies over the past decade have generally traded tighter than those of the broader corporate bond market as a whole, whether you\\'re talking about investment-grade or high-yield,\" said Vanguard senior analyst Omar Sanders. \"Given the defensive nature of health care overall and the inelasticity of demand, the spread differential is most prominent during times of market stress, like that seen at the onset of the pandemic.\"\\xa0\\nIn the U.S., health care spreads tend to be tighter than for corporate bonds as a whole, especially in periods of market stress\\nSpreads for health care segments minus the average spread for corporate bonds\\nNotes: The spreads shown are all option-adjusted and as measured by the Bloomberg Corporate Bond Index for investment-grade bonds in the left-hand figure and the Bloomberg High Yield Index for high-yield bonds in the right-hand figure. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Data are from November 29, 2013, through February 9, 2022.\\nSources: Bloomberg and Vanguard.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\"In Europe, the performance story is very similar,\" said Vanguard credit analyst Johnny Will. \"The health care and pharmaceutical sectors have consistently traded inside the Pan-European corporate index, given the higher average ratings of the sector and defensive sector qualities. The same spike in outperformance is visible in the chart below at the start of the pandemic.\"\\n\\xa0\\nIn Europe, health care spreads have traced a similar path versus corporate bonds\\nNotes: The spreads shown are all option-adjusted and as measured by the Bloomberg Pan-European Aggregate Corporate Index. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The data are from November 29, 2013, through January 20, 2022.\\nSources: Bloomberg and Vanguard.\\n\\nThe road ahead for health care\\n\"Even with the widening in bond markets to start 2022, health care continued to outperform broader bond indexes,\" said Vanguard senior credit analyst Jamie Shin. \"We believe the industry\\'s strong fundamentals coupled with a more benign regulatory environment across most subsectors have contributed to the relative strength. For active managers that will make security selection even more crucial going forward.\"\\nAs we look for winners and losers in 2022, we will be focusing on the following themes:\\n\\nAccelerating innovation. Some trends that began or accelerated during the pandemic will continue to drive the direction and pace of innovation in the industry. Pharma and biotech companies will continue to invest aggressively in emerging therapy areas like cell and gene that became more mainstream due to COVID-19 research. This will create strong demand for R&D tools and support services—some provided by life sciences and medical devices companies, others provided by health care services companies. Health care providers are another subsector to watch. After seeing the rapid adoption of telehealth and decreases in ER admissions, health care providers will be looking for ways to offer care outside of the traditional hospital setting.We prefer companies with a track record of successfully sourcing and integrating growth assets and see some interesting opportunities in the life sciences, medical devices, and services subsectors.\\nPartnerships and smaller deals over megamergers. While companies remain interested in finding ways to supplement organic growth and capital markets remain favorable for the sector, most management commentary from a recent industry flagship conference focused on tuck-ins and partnerships rather than transformational deals. With large M&A transactions in 2021 facing regulatory scrutiny (such as UnitedHealth\\'s $13 billion bid for Change Healthcare, which the U.S. Department of Justice is suing to block) and examples of profitable partnerships without a huge investment up front (such as Pfizer and BioNTech partnering to develop a COVID-19 vaccine), companies are incentivized to look for smaller deals or partnerships over megadeals.While this is a favorable trend from a credit perspective as it reduces deal risk, we remain somewhat cautious on select pharmaceutical companies based on their historical preference for larger deals and stronger incentives to buy assets ahead of existing products’ patent expirations.\\nCost management. The emergence and subsequent waves of COVID-19 resulted in an unprecedented level of labor shortages in addition to cost inflation. This puts larger players with negotiating leverage and/or market density at an advantage over competitors.Efforts to manage costs will support demand for services from health IT providers and outsourced service providers (contract research and manufacturing services for pharma and biotech, contract labor for providers). As payors also look to manage increasing costs, there will be more interest in affordable alternatives such as private label products and lower-cost-of-care settings (those outside of hospitals).\\xa0\\nGreater private equity involvement. Private equity will continue to play an important role as both buyers and sellers. In 2021, we saw a private equity consortium strike a $34 billion deal to purchase medical distributor Medline in the largest leveraged buyout since the 2008 global financial crisis. With public companies shying away from larger deals, we could see private equity doing more and bigger deals than in the past. Private equity-driven deals are likely to have higher leverage and weaker creditor protections but can be interesting opportunities to get exposure to emerging growth areas while picking up yield.We expect higher levels of interest in health care services, given the focus on cost management, and will be looking for opportunities there while trying to avoid idiosyncratic risks such as customer concentration and excessively aggressive financial policy.\\n\\n\"At Vanguard, we have a global fixed income team of analysts, portfolio managers, and traders who use a bottom-up, fundamentals-based credit research process and a disciplined, collaborative approach to risk-taking,\" said Sanders. \"So we\\'re well-positioned for an investment environment like this for generating alpha through identifying securities that are likely to outperform and sidestepping those that are likely to disappoint.\"Active fixed income at Vanguard\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$335B\\nTaxable bond AUM 14* funds/1 ETF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$230B\\nMunicipal bond AUM 5 national funds/7 state-specific funds\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30+\\nPortfolio managers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30+\\nTraders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n60+\\nCredit research analysts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n140+\\nDedicated team members\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Includes funds advised by Wellington Management Company LLP.Note: As of December 31, 2021.\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nVanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars.

       "  'content': 'We recently shared our views on potential global economic effects of Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine. We described a situation where rising oil prices and tighter financial conditions would push growth lower and inflation higher.\\nWhy focus on these factors? And why make our forecasts conditional on their movements? Because in fast-moving, uncertain situations, it\\'s best to acknowledge what we don\\'t know and control for what we do know.\\n\"We\\'re the first to admit that we don\\'t know how the war is going to play out,\" said Shaan Raithatha, a Vanguard senior economist on the team researching the war\\'s economic effects. \"What we do know is that it will affect oil prices, and oil prices will affect global growth and inflation. So, we frame it in terms of oil prices in this range or that range. Similarly, the impact of financial conditions, depending on the scenario, is either going to be X, Y, or Z.\"\\nThe table below puts forth our views for a range of oil price and financial conditions scenarios.\\nAs oil prices rise and conditions tighten, global growth slows and inflation accelerates\\nNotes: The table presents just two of the most important factors Vanguard considers related to war in Ukraine—oil prices and financial conditions—and illustrates their expected impact on growth and inflation under four distinct scenarios. Other variables, not depicted, also factor into the analysis. The probabilities shown are as of the date of the analysis and are subject to change.\\xa0\\nSource: Vanguard analysis, as of March 10, 2022.\\n\\nAs the table shows, the scenarios we view as most likely—oil prices settling in around early March levels with limited to moderate tightening of financial conditions (such as increased borrowing costs)—would lead to consumer price inflation remaining elevated in 2022 and economies growing above or below trend but avoiding recession.\\nOur broad scenarios are global, though we do expect economic effects of the war in Ukraine to be felt more profoundly in the euro area than in other developed markets, given the region\\'s greater energy dependence on and proximity to Russia.\\nScenarios make sense today and every day\\nIn contrast to that of some forecasters, our approach acknowledges the significant role of uncertainty, especially in situations of some magnitude. Our focus on oil prices and financial conditions now is akin to our focus on vaccine efficacy and virulence of emerging variants in assessing potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\"With developments such as COVID-19 and now, unfortunately, the war in Ukraine, we think about economic outcomes in terms of scenarios,\" said Andrew Patterson, Vanguard senior international economist. \"Because of the uncertainty involved, we qualitatively and quantitatively work through multiple potential outcomes and try to assign probabilities to them. Our focus is pointed and situational.\"\\nVanguard doesn\\'t employ scenarios only in the context of history-defining events, however. The approach is just as valuable in the context of more commonplace uncertainty, such as that provided regularly by policymakers and the financial markets. For example, we present our long-term asset-return forecasts within a range of potential outcomes rather than as specific-point forecasts. We also present our optimal portfolios in the context of varying economic environments. (The Vanguard economic and market outlook for 2022 includes both our asset-return forecasts and our optimal portfolios.)\\nBut a scenarios-based approach is clearly prudent for the current challenge. \"As we continue to assess developments related to Ukraine under this framework, we will incorporate relevant and timely updates into our perspective,\" Patterson said. \"We took a similar approach during the pandemic, incorporating views on vaccines\\' efficacy, production, and distribution. We hope to incorporate details of a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine in our framework sooner rather than later.\"\\nNote:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Flows into exchange-traded funds have accelerated dramatically across the industry in recent years, making it impossible to ignore that something important is going on in public investment markets.\\nThe buzz clearly goes beyond last year's record ETF inflows of more than $900 billion—a figure that easily eclipsed 2020's record $500 billion. Over the past 10 years, inflows totaled a whopping $3.7 trillion. By comparison, net flows into open-end mutual funds over the same decade were $764 billion, about a fifth of the ETF total.1\\nAnd when you add market appreciation to the new money flowing into ETFs over that period, total ETF assets under management rocketed to $7.3 trillion at the end of 2021, from about $1.4 trillion at the end of 2011.\\nSo what's going on, and why should investors care?\\nTo begin, investors and advisors are waking up to what makes ETFs attractive—namely their trading flexibility, diversification, lower costs, and potential tax benefits. In sum, they're a powerful tool for constructing portfolios with relative ease. After three decades in the making, proof of the ETF concept is here in that ETFs have survived in all kinds of market environments.\\nFigure 1. Industry ETF inflows have soared over the last decade\\nETF annual cash flows in billions\\nNote: Each bar represents total inflows across all U.S.-listed ETFs as of December 31 of the year shown.\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from Morningstar, Inc.\\n\\nCore equities exposure led in 2021\\nThe 2,837 U.S.-listed ETFs at the end of 2021 reflect a wide variety of strategies, from broad total-market funds to factor-based ETFs to finely tuned thematic approaches, such as technology-focused strategies. Even actively managed ETFs are increasingly part of the ETF ecosystem, though investors have yet to fully embrace them.\\nBut sifting through the buzz and innovation around ETFs quickly reveals that inflows are mostly going into low-cost, indexed, core exposures. That was certainly the case in 2021, when 40% of all cash flows went into U.S.-focused ETFs that track the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and into total market index funds. In other words, the rise of ETFs is closely tied to the rise of indexing.\\nIn addition to U.S.-focused ETFs, investors are using ETFs to explore various pockets of the investment universe. For example, interest in international strategies blossomed in 2021—with inflows rising almost sixfold from 2020 levels, to $165 billion—as investors increasingly gravitated to non-U.S. equities amid attractive valuations.\\nFixed income ETFs have also grown more popular, garnering higher proportions of overall flows. Flows last year into bond ETFs—including municipal bond ETFs—were about even with their 2020 inflows, but the accelerating rise of bond ETFs in recent years has become a powerful part of the overall ETF adoption story.\\nFigure 2. Where the record ETF inflows are going\\nCash flows into U.S. equity ETFs were significantly higher in 2021 than for other ETF categories\\nETF net cash flows by asset class in billions\\nNote: Data cover total inflows across all U.S.-listed ETFs for calendar years 2020 and 2021.\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from Morningstar, Inc.\\n\\nThe bond ETF proof point\\nIt's worth noting that the introduction of bond ETFs in 2002 was accompanied by questions. The thinking went like this: Because buying and selling individual bonds can be difficult at the best of times, a bond ETF composed of myriad individual bonds might hit rocky shoals and become extremely difficult to trade when markets turn choppy.\\nBut that hasn't happened, for important conceptual and structural reasons, and a pair of market dislocations loom large as proof points. Bond ETFs weathered the 2007–2009 global financial crisis and, perhaps most important, were crucial components of the investing landscape during the February/March 2020 COVID-19-related crash—and afterward, they continued to thrive.\\nAs bond market liquidity grew scarce in the early weeks of the pandemic, bond ETFs trading in the secondary market ended up playing a vital price discovery role. Although bid-ask spreads on bond ETFs widened, as one would expect in a volatile market, they widened far less than the spreads of individual bonds. And trading never froze. In the end, bond ETFs were a critical source of liquidity, helping to keep the market of underlying bonds from seizing up. It's as if the presumed shortcoming of bond ETFs had been turned on its head. In addition, the Federal Reserve chose to fold corporate bond ETFs into its plans for expanded quantitative easing, signaling something more significant: ETFs are an integral element of contemporary financial markets.\\nETFs are here to stay\\nThe advantages of ETFs are clear—they include convenience and an improved client experience featuring low costs, a breadth of choices, and potential tax efficiencies. ETFs give investors relatively easy access to swaths of the investment universe both broad and narrow, with plentiful liquidity. Many of these conveniences extend to fixed income, and that's significant in that ETFs have made the careful calibration of credit risk, duration, and inflation protection in portfolio construction easier than ever before.\\nThe more assets that flow into ETFs, the more the advantages grow, from improved liquidity to lower costs of ownership.\\nFor advisors, efficient and scalable portfolio construction means more time for developing client relations. That's arguably one of advisors' most important functions, and one that Vanguard aims to help advisors optimize, particularly as ETFs' popularity keeps growing.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Morningstar, Inc., as of December 31, 2021.

       "  'content': 'Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley and Co-head of Emerging Markets Active Fixed Income, Nick Eisinger, discuss the impact of the war in Ukraine on emerging markets and how Vanguard is managing the associated risk.\\n\\nUkraine Crisis: Portfolio Perspectives\\nInsights from London\\nTim Buckley: Hello, I\\'m Tim Buckley, Vanguard\\'s CEO, and I\\'m joined by Nick Eisinger here in London. And Nick is the Co-Head of our Emerging Markets Fixed Income team.\\nNick, with Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, we have the tragic loss of life, of humanitarian crisis. We\\'ve seen extreme sanctions. We\\'ve also seen the markets react. Russian securities, whether equities or fixed income, have plummeted. In the coming days and through next week, we\\'ll see a lot of the Russian securities drop out of the major market indexes, first on the equity side, and then eventually on the fixed income side.\\nIf we go beyond, if we look beyond kind of the immediate impact in the markets, if we look broadly at EM, the world you live in, what are the knock-on effects? You haven\\'t really seen the same reverberations you might have expected with the outbreak of war in Ukraine.\\nNick Eisinger: Yes, thank you, Tim. We\\'re talking contagion to a broader emerging market universe. So far, pretty limited. Much more limited, for example, than the contagion effects post-COVID news. In many ways, much more limited around previous episodes of say taper tantrum from the Fed.\\nNow that doesn\\'t necessarily mean that we\\'re going to stay there because I think what we need to follow is whether there\\'s an escalation of the situation on the ground, how that plays out. That has particular poignance for the Central East European regions, some of the ex-Soviet Union countries, for obvious reasons, for geographical reasons. Economic linkages, obviously, with Russia are very strong there as well, as, indeed, are some political linkages.\\nThe other big factor, which is both in emerging market and the global factor is the price of oil, which is continuing to spike as we speak. That\\'ll help some emerging market countries, oil exporters. But on balance, if it\\'s going up quickly, it has big ramifications for global growth as well. And that\\'s generally not good for emerging markets.\\nSo when we observe the credit universe in EM right now, we see some early signs of contagion. We see some bonds selling off on a risk-adjusted basis. But we certainly don\\'t observe that, a big ramping up of the risk factors that are priced into that market at the moment.\\nTim Buckley: You deal in risk all the time. You deal with emerging markets. You deal with a lot more risk than most fixed income investors. There are always tail risks. The market\\'s got the intentions of Russia wrong in invading Ukraine. How do you think about tail risks, and as you develop a portfolio, because you won\\'t be right on all of them?\\nNick Eisinger: Of course. So tail risks, you know, it\\'s useful to sort of think of the definitions. A remote probability event but has very material implications to, in this case, portfolios.\\nAnd we really like to get away in the way we manage emerging markets from this concept of, \"My base case is this\" or \"My base case is that,\" because, inevitably, those are wrong.\\nBut the tail risk, in this particular instance, you know, is something you could not rule out. And so we spend a lot of our time interrogating alternative scenarios. We try to stress test the portfolio. Most obviously, at its most proximate set of events, so Russia and Ukraine exposures, as well as beyond that; and we come out of those stress tests, big collaboration with the risk group and our team and our own knowledge and our own sort of foresight, if you like, and experience. And we come up with a number, or at least we did back in November, that we thought was unacceptable for our portfolio and unacceptable that our clients should be bearing. And so from around November time, we started to really dial back in some of these exposures.\\nAnd the other interesting angle here is that had we got that wrong, we don\\'t actually think we would have necessarily lost out that much because particular Russian credits at that time were looking pretty expensive, to be frank with you. So there was some asymmetry, if you like, about disengaging from some of those trades.\\nThe other thing that\\'s closely associated with this is how you size trades in portfolios. So there\\'s going to be situations where you think you have to be particularly active. Part of our world, you have to be involved in some of these trades. But you want to size a portfolio based on that downside risk. And really what I mean by that is you don\\'t want a position to destroy your fund to such a degree that you\\'re never going to come back. And more importantly, your clients will never come back. So we spend a lot of our time thinking about concentration, correlated risks, downside scenarios. Of course, we think about upside scenarios as well. But it really shows you, I think, there is a very important consideration. You know, we do this weekly and then, more often than not, under situations like this, we do it with a lot more depth as well.\\nTim Buckley: Nick, your title says Emerging Markets, but I know your expertise goes far beyond that. Let me hit the developed markets. Anything you worry about there? You know, the Fed has stepped back from a 50-basis-point increase. Now that was what the market had priced in, and Chairman Powell essentially committed to a 25, at least his intentions for a 25-basis point increase. Does that worry you at all? Are there fears that we\\'re falling behind of inflation in some of the developed markets?\\nNick Eisinger: Yes, great question, Tim. I think that\\'s currently what the broader global market still focuses on, despite what\\'s going on closer to home, for us at least.\\nSo I think a lot of the rate hikes from the Fed are priced into the market. That would typically imply that as Powell goes in March, 25 basis points most likely, the market shouldn\\'t be overly concerned and trade particularly badly on that.\\nThe next question, of course, is what does it take for Powell to pivot the other way? And so it wasn\\'t very long ago the Fed pivoted to normalization. Sorry, guys, the tide\\'s going out. This is enough. We think it would take a pretty big shock that has the global ramifications for Powell and the FOMC to really step back. The biggest vex is, obviously, the oil price, a big spike and a prolonged spike in oil prices. The issue there really being what that does to the economic cycle.\\nSo we know that one thing you want to avoid when you run risk is recessions, and at the moment, you know, we still feel pretty comfortable; but the recession is a long way out. But, obviously, there are certain global shocks that can happen to bring that forward. So that\\'s the one thing I think at a global level you look at. So that\\'s the Fed\\'s dilemma, and perhaps it\\'s not that much of a dilemma right now.\\nThe ECB, back in Europe, however, I think faces a bigger dilemma. The ECB is much closer to potentially some bigger restrictions on energy, which has big inflation implications, at a time when inflation and core inflation across Europe is already high. We did see a mini pivot from the ECB similar to what the Fed was telling us, that it\\'s coming out of some of this QE. It\\'s going to start normalizing policy over time. That\\'s a much harder battle for it to fight at the moment.\\nNotwithstanding, we would still see the ECB as embarking from a gradual tightening path, less telegraphed perhaps, I\\'m afraid, but nonetheless, I think that\\'s where things are at the moment. And this is a difficult situation because, you know, the monetary support is arguably going out at the margin; and you\\'ve got a whole host of global risk events. But as I said, at the moment are somewhat contained; but we should not dismiss the risk that they could become uncontained in the foreseeable future.\\nTim Buckley: Nick, as always, thank you for the insights; and thank you for taking great care of our clients\\' money. And to all of our clients, thank you for your continued trust in Vanguard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow events in Ukraine change our economic views\\nHigher oil prices resulting from events in Ukraine are likely to trim economic growth and accelerate inflation to levels beyond what was previously expected.View article'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The initial impact on the global economy from the tragic events in Ukraine will be delivered primarily through higher commodity prices, according to a new analysis by Vanguard\\'s global economics team. The higher prices, most notably for energy, will hamper growth and cause broader prices to climb further than previously expected, according to the analysis.\\nTighter financial conditions, diminished consumer and business confidence, and elevated uncertainty will also have an effect, though to a lesser extent. The economic impact is likely to be more profound in the euro area, given its greater dependence on Russian energy, than in the United States or the United Kingdom.\\nPersistently higher energy prices and tighter financial conditions could shave up to a percentage point from previously anticipated 2022 growth for the euro area, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Meanwhile, inflation, as measured by headline consumer price indexes, could accelerate by 1 to 3 percentage points above what Vanguard had previously forecast.\\nInvestors need to appreciate the tremendous uncertainty confronting markets, said Shaan Raithatha, a London-based Vanguard senior economist, part of the team researching possible effects from a range of potential developments. He emphasized, \"The work we\\'re doing is based on conditions at present, and the situation is clearly fast-moving.\"\\nRising energy prices likely to weigh on growth and generate higher inflation\\nNotes: Prices are daily settlement prices for front-month Brent crude futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange in London and for front-month West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\\nSources: Vanguard illustration, using data from Bloomberg, as of March 2, 2022.\\n\\nPrices of benchmark oil futures trading in both London and New York are up more than 45% since the start of the year and more than 20% since a week before Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, reflecting both oil\\'s greater perceived risk and concerns about restrictions on supply.\\nHow long high energy prices persist and to what degree will be vital to informing whether our views move from our baseline case to a downside of even slower growth and higher inflation. For conditions to deteriorate to the point of ushering in a recession, oil prices would need to climb to a range of $130 to $150 a barrel for several quarters and financial conditions would need to tighten broadly, according to the Vanguard economics team\\'s analysis. Vanguard foresees developed-market inflation averaging more than 8% for all of 2022 in such a case.\\nGrowth and inflation effects would be felt more acutely in the euro area, which gets 40% of its natural gas and 25% of its oil from Russia,1 than in the United Kingdom or the United States, which use much less Russian energy.\\nCentral bank policy decisions hang in the balance\\nThe developments in Ukraine present central banks with a pertinent challenge: Do they continue down the path toward tighter monetary policy to fight even higher inflation, or do they pause and take stock given the new risks to growth? Vanguard currently doesn\\'t expect recent developments to materially affect U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England policy stances. The Fed\\'s chair told Congress on March 2 that a hike in the federal funds rate target at the Fed\\'s March 16 meeting remained appropriate, though he did acknowledge concern over events unfolding in Ukraine.\\nThe European Central Bank (ECB), meanwhile, meets sooner, on March 10. Vanguard hasn\\'t changed its expectation for a late-2022 ECB rate hike, though we\\'ll be watching developments closely. \"Our view is that recent events and the accompanying uncertainty have the potential to make the ECB more cautious,\" Raithatha said. \"This will skew the balance of risks toward the Governing Council delaying its normalization of monetary policy.

       "  'content': 'As investing uncertainty triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic continues beyond the 2-year mark, one constant has been the continued adoption of bond ETFs. Investors continue to pour money into bond ETFs—more than $210 billion in 2021 alone—accelerating a trend that began two decades ago.1 Over the five years ended December 31, 2020, bond ETF assets grew at an average annual rate of 25.0%, compared with the 7.3% growth rate for the outstanding value of the overall global bond market in the same period.2\\nWhat\\'s driving bond ETF growth?\\nThere\\'s evidence that many investors are becoming more inclined to use pooled products such as ETFs rather than hold a portfolio of individual bonds. When it comes to bond investing, ETFs hold several potential advantages over a ladder of individual bonds. Bond ETFs may offer greater control, diversification, and improved liquidity.\\nHere are two ways bond ETFs can help amplify your clients\\' portfolios, and a suggested plan for implementation. They can:\\n1. Allow for more precise control and diversification\\nInvesting in a single, near-term bond can be a sound practice provided it fits a defined near-term objective, and laddering a portfolio of, say, 10 to 25 bonds with sequentially longer maturities may seem to be a way to diversify a portfolio while retaining a hands-on approach. However, the laddering strategy can present challenges such as reinvestment risk and excessive sector concentration.\\nIn theory, any bond portfolio carries some level of reinvestment risk, which is the chance that when a bond matures, a bond with a similarly attractive yield may not be available for reinvestment. But this risk is magnified in a laddered bond strategy, where hefty chunks of the portfolio\\'s value must be periodically reinvested (with coupon payments sitting in cash). Because most ETFs track diversified and well-defined indexes, bond ETFs tend to have very stable risk-factor exposures and they can be bought and sold in slices as small as one share.\\nWith individual bonds there is a chance that the portfolio will skew toward high-quality and liquid U.S. Treasuries or municipals, because other types of bonds are more challenging to source. For instance, corporate, securitized, and non-U.S. bonds exhibit credit, prepayment, and liquidity risks that can be daunting for any investor. An allocation to bond ETFs provides more flexible exposure to these markets, making them a highly effective—and simple—way to diversify and enhance yield while maintaining a strong quality profile.\\nYour clients may gravitate toward individual bonds because a \"hold to maturity\" mindset allows them to ignore interim price movements. However, all bonds have dynamic market prices, and whether held in a ladder, a mutual fund, or an ETF, a client who needs to access liquidity prior to a given bond\\'s maturity is subject to the same price risk. Additionally, a typical bond ladder holds far fewer bonds than a diversified bond ETF. As a result, bond ladders carry more default risk—if one bond goes bad, it could meaningfully affect a client\\'s portfolio.\\n2. Reduce costs compared with building individual bond ladders\\nA laddered bond portfolio does not carry an explicit expense ratio. This may have made it more appealing a few years ago when bond mutual funds had an average expense ratio greater than 0.50%.3 Now bond ETF expense ratios are often measured in single basis points. The asset-weighted average expense ratio for bond ETFs was 0.16% as of December 31, 2020,4 and it was just 0.04% for Vanguard\\'s corporate bond ETFs and broad-market bond ETFs.5\\nTransacting in the bond market also has the implicit costs of bid-ask spreads to consider. Because ETFs trade as securities on an exchange and their bonds are sourced by institutional investors, they confer a transparent layer of liquidity that can dramatically reduce spreads, particularly for corporate or securitized bonds.\\nThe table below illustrates an example of quotes available from a range of dealers on February 17, 2021, for a specific large and liquid bond that happened to be a top holding in Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT).6\\n\\nThe spread between the best bid and ask prices that may be accessible to institutional investors—who can readily \"shop around\" among different dealers—was about $0.15.\\nFor investors who might be more limited in their access, and only able to access Dealer A, the bid-ask spread was a little more than $0.50.\\nVCIT traded at a spread of $0.01.7\\n\\nConsidering the spread and expense ratio, ETFs are a very cost-effective way to expand into sectors offering yield premiums and diversification.\\nDepth of a sample corporate bond quote\\n\\n\\n\\nDealer\\nBid ($)\\nAsk ($)\\nBid quantity(thousands)\\nAsk quantity(thousands)\\n\\n\\nA\\n116.118\\n116.646\\n100\\n100\\n\\n\\nB\\n116.314\\n—\\n500\\n—\\n\\n\\nC\\n115.238\\n117.504\\n200\\n600\\n\\n\\nD\\n116.258\\n116.468\\n100\\n100\\n\\n\\nE\\n115.072\\n—\\n100\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Bloomberg.\\nIntegrating bond ETFs into a portfolio of laddered bonds\\nA wholesale shift into a new investment vehicle can be a tall order, so a phased integration of bond ETFs may be an effective first step. Below are two frameworks for reinvesting a maturing bond from the portfolio rather than a sell-down across the portfolio.\\n\"Re-laddering\" option\\nIn a \"re-laddering\" framework, simply reinvest the matured capital in an ETF with a duration that approximates the maturity of the individual bond being purchased at the end of the ladder. In future years, the portfolio may be balanced with intermediate- and short-duration ETFs, transforming the portfolio gradually.\\n\"Liquidity sleeve\" option:\\nInvesting matured capital by choosing one or more ETFs that approximate the actual (or desired) characteristics of the portfolio in the aggregate is another option. The ETF position can be thought of as a “liquidity sleeve” that sits alongside the laddered bonds and grows over time. It could be tapped to source as-needed cash in a cost-effective way, without disrupting the characteristics of the portfolio.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nBond ETFs are an important part of the investing toolkit because many offer liquidity, low cost, and diversified and consistent exposure. Consider adding them as core components of any newly built portfolio or integrate them into existing portfolios—even those dedicated to individual bonds. \\n\\n\\n\\nCheck out our bond ETF lineup\\nLearn how our low-cost bond ETFs provide full coverage of the fixed income universe.Explore Vanguard Bond ETFs®'},\n",

       "  'content': 'As digital \"robo-advice\" offerings have expanded in scope and availability, questions have arisen about the future of traditional advice given by humans. Will digital advice take over?\\nOur research finds that human-advised clients are, in fact, not likely to switch to digital advisors. Quite the opposite, 9 in 10 robo-advised clients are considering switching to a human advisor in the future.\\xa0\\nAt the same time, clients believe that there is some room for automation of services in a practice.\\nFor human advisors, then, perhaps the most useful strategy is to figure out how to incorporate both modes of advice into their practice. We asked 1,500 advised clients in the United States about loyalty and perceptions regarding both types of financial advice.\\xa0\\nAmong our findings:\\n\\nAdvice adds value across the board: Regardless of the method of delivery, investors believe advice provides substantially higher incremental portfolio value versus \"going it alone.\" The perceived value-add to annual performance was 5% for human advice and 3% for digital-only advice.\\nPreference for financial advisors is enduring:\\xa0While more than 90% of human-advised clients say they would not consider switching to a digital service, 88% of robo-advised clients would consider switching to a human advisor in the future. However, time, willingness, and ability to manage investments seem to play a critical role in determining the choice of advice delivery.\\nClients prefer emotional support from human advisors: Investors using human advisors estimate being $160,000 closer to achieving their financial goals. Three times as many investors report having strong peace of mind when working with a human advisor as compared to going it alone.\\nDigital also serves a role for clients: Our findings also uncovered specific areas where investors prefer digital advice, such as for certain portfolio-management services (e.g., diversification and tax optimization).\\nPreference for advice service delivery is not dictated by client age or wealth: Contrary to popular belief, we do not find that millennials have distinct preferences from other generations regarding the automation of service within advice. Across all generations, wealth levels, and advice-delivery types, clients suggest that human advisors should consider automating some portfolio management services. Advisors should leverage technology to scale their business while strengthening their uniquely human value.\\n\\nQuantifying how investors value advice\\nClearly, investors want financial advice and find it valuable. Our survey asked investors to estimate their annual portfolio returns achieved with whichever mode of financial advice they used. It then asked them to estimate what they thought their returns would be over a three-year period without the assistance of their advice service.\\xa0\\nIndividuals working with human advisors estimated that on an annualized basis, they achieved a 15% average return with the help of their advisor, and estimated they would have seen only a 10% return if they had been unadvised—making a perceived value-add to annual performance of 5%.\\nThose with digital-only advice reported perceived average portfolio returns of 24% using their digital advice service. They estimated their return would drop to 21% if they did not use a digital advisor—making a perceived value-add to annual performance of 3%.\\xa0\\nInvestors believe human and digital advisors provide substantial portfolio value\\nNotes: Respondents were asked, \"In your experience with your human (or digital) advisor, what would you estimate your average annual investment returns to be in the past three years? If you have not had an advisor for three years, think about the relationship you have had with your advisor thus far.\"Respondents were also prompted to estimate their average annual investment return while working with their human (or digital) advisor. They were then told to imagine they did not have their advisor and instead managed their investments on their own. Given those circumstances, they were asked, “What would you imagine your average annual investment returns to be in the same period?”\\nSources: Vanguard and Escalent, 2021.\\n\\nHuman advisors still hold an edge\\nWhile the advice landscape is indeed evolving with the breadth and depth of digital offerings becoming available, our research indicates investors maintain significant loyalty to human advisors.\\nSurvey participants were asked, \"If you had to leave your current [human] advisor today, what type of advising relationship would you search for in the future?\"\\nFor investors that already use a human advisor, 93% said they would choose an advice service that includes a human advisor in the future. Despite the common headlines about technology replacing humans, our data suggests that investors have strong loyalty to keeping a human financial advisor.\\nInvestors with a human advisor not likely to switch to robo-only\\nNote: The sample in this figure includes all responding investors who only have human advisors (1,175 in total).\\nSources: Vanguard and Escalent, 2021.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nConversely, such loyalty did not exist when it came to digital-advised investors presented with the potential opportunity to hire a human replacement. When we asked current robo-advised clients about their future preference for advice delivery, 88% of those clients said they would be willing or extremely willing to work with a human advisor in the future.\\xa0\\nWe believe this has strong business-development implications for human advisors: Robo-advised clients could represent an untapped and under-targeted market to convert for human advisors, especially as those investors’ needs become more complex.\\nDigital-advised investors are willing to switch to human advice\\nRespondents were asked, \"on a scale of one to seven, how willing would you be to work with a human financial advisor in the future?\"\\nNote: The sample in this figure includes all responding investors who only have digital advisors (135 in total).\\nSources: Vanguard and Escalent, 2021.\\n\\nKnow what type of value you provide\\nInvestors did tend to favor one mode of advice—human or digital—for different types of advice tasks and services. For instance, investors said they preferred a human advisor when it came to:\\n\\nKnowing clients—feeling that they and their retirement goals are understood.\\nDeveloping a connection and relationship with clients.\\nWorking in clients\\' best interests—taking good care of them.\\nMaking clients feel listened to and understood.\\nDemonstrating empathy for clients\\' personal situations and needs.\\n\\nWhen it came to activities with a strong emphasis on portfolio construction and more functional tasks, investors preferred the service delivery be digital and automated:\\n\\nManaging taxes and capital gains efficiently.\\nGathering accurate inputs for clients by helping them understand how to answer.\\nAccounting for scenarios of different market conditions or life events (what-ifs).\\nPreventing details, or entire accounts, from being overlooked.\\nDiversifying investments.\\nSimplifying for organized, cohesive management.\\n\\nImplications for your practice\\nHuman advisors can take away a number of action items from this research in order to remain competitive in the evolving advice landscape.\\n\\nForemost, be sure to highlight your emotional value. As our research affirmed, this is the top benefit investors attach to a human advisor. Do you convey effectively that you will partner with clients long-term to reach their financial and life goals? If not, perhaps your marketing or other aspects of your business are in line for a review. Upskilling for you or your team on “soft skills” might also be appropriate.\\nYou can also thoughtfully review your client-acquisition and onboarding, with an eye toward attracting digital-only investors who are willing to switch to a human advisor. Digital advice users expect a friction-free experience. Make it easy for potential clients to find you, learn about your offer, and sign up with you.\\nReferring back to our list on investor preferences—how are you and your team aligned with them? If you haven’t already done so recently, now would be a good time to inventory all of the services and activities you perform on behalf of clients.\\nAlign your resources to most appropriately fit the business tasks where investors perceive they provide the greatest value. In other words, are people aligned to the emotional and financial outcome value tasks? Is technology assigned to the portfolio tasks that can be automated? If not, a good action step might be to investigate tools that can make you more efficient.'},\n",

This event featured Vanguard ESG experts Sarah Hersh, head of ESG Product Management, and Doug Grim, a senior investment strategist focused on portfolio research.\\nHere are four takeaways from their discussion:\\nWe approach ESG from an engage, allocate, and avoid framework.\\nVanguard does this in three ways: through engaging with the portfolio companies in our internally managed equity funds, through allocating capital to portfolio companies in our active funds, and through developing products that allow investors to mitigate exposure to certain ESG risks.\\nThen, the final category we call avoid. We offer ESG products that enable investors to avoid exposure to certain risks or issues that violate their preferences. We currently offer four exclusionary index ESG products across equity and fixed income. These include our ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV), ESG International Stock ETF (VSGX), ESG U.S. Corporate Bond ETF (VCEB), and FTSE Social Index Fund Admiral™ Shares(VFTAX).\\nRead more about our approach to ESG investing.\\n\\xa0\\nBeware of the performance-price myth when implementing ESG products.\\nIt\\'s a commonly held misconception that there is a trade-off between ESG considerations and investment returns. In reality, ESG strategies can be incorporated into diversified portfolios without compromising their risk and return characteristics.\\nOur research observations are truly all over the place. Historically, we identified ESG products that showed less risk, products that showed more risk, products with higher returns, and products with lower returns. We found no consistent risk and return characteristics of these products versus the broad market.\\nLearn more about our research findings by reading, Is there a performance price for ESG investing?Contrary to conventional wisdom, U.S. ESG equity funds are cost-competitive\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you look at it on an equally weighted basis, whether from the index side or the active side, ESG specific funds are not necessarily more expensive than conventional index or active funds. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t individual funds that may be more expensive or possibly cheaper. Our research has found that, on average, we don’t necessarily see all ESG funds as being more expensive.\"\\n\\n\\n—Doug Grim\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage annual expense ratios\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, based on data from Morningstar, Inc., as of December 31, 2020.\\nNotes: Our sample includes all open-ended equity mutual funds and ETFs with a U.S. investment focus that were available for sale in the U.S., as of December 31, 2020, including all share classes of each fund. We removed funds with an industry investment focus. From this sample, we separated ESG-focused funds from other funds using Morningstar\\'s \"Sustainable Investment Strategies\" classification.\\n\\nESG is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all approach.\\nWe believe that you should follow a four-step process when it comes to prudent ESG decision-making. You need to determine your goals, or define; understand your options, or evaluate; decide on and document an approach that best fits the unique ESG concerns and investment needs of your client; and, finally, make sure to continually assess and maintain this strategy.\\nOnce you know what your client is looking for, how do you help them evaluate the different ESG options available, while also keeping their goals in mind?'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Editor\\'s note: This research is the product of a team of Vanguard corporate credit analysts affiliated with Vanguard\\'s active taxable bond funds. The team\\'s insights are included in portfolio managers\\' bond selection in Vanguard\\'s actively managed taxable bond funds. \\nShortages of semiconductor chips are contributing to severe global supply-chain disruptions and higher consumer prices for everything from cars to toothbrushes. Those disruptions are unlikely to ease in the near term.\\nThe pandemic has accelerated some secular trends, including remote work and cloud computing, that are likely to translate into permanent increases in chip demand. However, COVID-related pent-up spending and overordering by manufacturers to avoid production shutdowns should normalize.\\nFrom a credit perspective, we are cautious on semiconductor companies. \"Bond valuations have become extremely tight, driven by excellent operational performance metrics and plentiful free cash flow,\" said Vanguard Senior Credit Analyst Scott Miles. \"Looking ahead, though, chip supply is likely to eventually overshoot demand growth—the semiconductor industry is prone to boom and bust cycles. We see more value among their customers, industrial OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), many of which have proven adept at navigating both the chip shortages and inflationary pressures.\"\\nHow we got here\\nDemand for chips initially fell sharply at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Government-mandated lockdowns and dire predictions of a prolonged recession led to sharp cuts in industrial manufacturing and a buildup in chip inventories. Auto production in the United States, for example, fell by 23% in the second quarter of 2020 even though chip sales to that end market only declined by 6%.\\nThen the economy began to recover far more quickly than anticipated, and a surge in demand followed. Chip manufacturers struggled to respond accordingly due to both the length of the manufacturing process and the inelasticity of supply.\\nIn addition, U.S. chip customers have felt the effect of global shipping logjams since the start of the pandemic. Chips are usually shipped by air, so the loss of belly space in commercial flights due to drastic cuts to plane travel reduced air freight capacity by as much as 75% in April 2020.\\nLooking ahead, demand will be key\\n\"We\\'re expecting a permanent increase in chip demand from PCs and other semiconductor end markets like networking equipment for remote work and learning,\" said Mr. Miles. \"Cloud computing apps and associated data center equipment should remain growth vectors as well. On the other hand, demand related to pent-up spending on consumer electronics is likely to prove more transitory.\"\\nAn even more worrisome development will be the winding down of widespread overordering and inventory hoarding on the part of distributors and OEMs—behavior that has aggravated chip shortages. The AlphaWise survey of chip distributors showed that inventory-building was prevalent throughout 2021, and even the latest reading shows that more than half of their customers are continuing to amass inventory. The survey results, shown in the figure below, fit with reports of double- or even triple-ordering on the part of OEMs. Such widespread overordering is a trend that is unlikely to end well for chip manufacturers.\\nAn end to inventory hoarding by OEMs could lead to a sharp downturn in demand\\nNote: Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding.\\nSources: AlphaWise and Morgan Stanley Research.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOur credit outlook for semiconductor manufacturers and industrial OEMs\\nCurrent credit valuations of semiconductor chip manufacturers\\' securities reflect supportive market trends. The future is unlikely to be as bright as 2021, however.\\nAs chip shortages persist into 2022, they will continue to add to global inflationary pressures. Double-ordering and inventory hoarding are likely to contribute to significant oversupply when the cycle turns. So, too, will recent substantial capacity expansion efforts.\\nWe see more value downstream in the securities of industrial OEMs, many of which have managed to successfully navigate supply shortages and rising input costs, including for labor. Moreover, supply constraints have enabled OEMs to raise prices to protect their margins, adjust their product mix to focus on their most profitable offerings, and improve their cash flow.\\n\"Auto manufacturers and many other industrial OEMs are also in the midst of a cyclical upturn thanks to strong demand coming out of the pandemic,\" said Vanguard Credit Analyst Andreas Nagstrup, \"And we would expect production volumes to accelerate as the semiconductor shortages eventually normalize.\"Vanguard active taxable bond funds with corporate credit exposure include the following.

That's why we set a goal in 2019 to return an additional $1 billion in value to shareholders by the end of 2025.\\nSince we set this ambitious goal, Vanguard has already reduced expense ratios and lowered fees across our investment lineup. That includes more than 225 fee reductions across Vanguard's active and index mutual funds, ETFs, and trusts.\\nHow Vanguard investor savings stack up\\nExpense ratio reductions are just one tool Vanguard uses to return value to shareholders. We've also lowered investor costs through multiple other channels, including by broadening access to lower-cost share classes and expanding access to commission-free brokerage transactions.\\nThrough these channels, Vanguard has saved investors more than $450 million from 2019 through 2021, and we expect to reach $650 million in savings by the end of 2022.\\nIn short, Vanguard is well on its way to the $1 billion goal.\\nHow Vanguard is progressing toward $1 billion in shareholder cost savings\\nNote: Chart shows returned shareholder value realized and projected since 2019.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhy costs matter so much\\nIn the end, aggressive cost savings can increase an investor's overall chance of success.

FTSE Russell is the benchmark provider for our two equity ESG ETFs and our FTSE Social Index Fund.\\nIn Part 1 of this two-part blog post, we highlighted the findings from our recently published research paper, focusing on the performance statistics of an index-based solution employing a rigorous, rules-based ESG-centric screening and exclusion process. Here we show the impact of that process in more detail, again using the FTSE US All Cap Choice Index to illustrate.\\nAs this case study shows, the results are intuitive in that the screening can have a significant impact on specific industries or sectors directly related to the screened products and activities. However, the overall composition of the index is not greatly affected.\\nWhile the screening process varies across the Global Choice series, the FTSE US All Cap Choice Index excludes stocks using the entire suite of product- and conduct-related screens. These range from such vice products as gambling and tobacco, to weapons manufacturing to governance issues such as a company's diversity and anti-corruption policies and procedures, as detailed in our research paper.\\nRead more about the construction of our ESG Indexes in our Ground Rules for Global Choice Index Series.\\nAs shown in the charts below, while the number of stocks in the US Choice Index fell across industries (gray bars) compared to that in the benchmark (teal bars), industry weights were fairly similar between the two.\\nNumber of stocks—FTSE USA All Cap benchmark versus FTSE US All Cap Choice Index\\nSource:\\xa0FTSE Russell.

For example, Energy went from 63 stocks to eight stocks and ended up with a weight close to zero. Of course, other industry weights will tend to rise: In this example, the US Choice exposures to Technology, Consumer Discretionary and Health Care stocks increased modestly versus those of the benchmark.\\nA look at the more granular sector classification level shows that the Oil, Gas, and Coal sector was completely eliminated, while the Alternative Energy sector dropped by only one stock.

As such, we continue to see full-year 2022 growth around 4%.\\nGrowth appears to have stabilized in the fourth quarter; we continue to see fourth-quarter growth around 5.5%.\\n\\nEuro area\\nCOVID-19-related restrictions on activity continue in many countries in the euro area, although the toughest of them, in the Netherlands, are being scaled back.\\n\\nThe recent surge in daily virus cases to more than 2,000 per million is likely to continue to weigh on growth in the first quarter of 2022.\\nThis development is part of Vanguard\\'s base case and, as such, we maintain our full-year 2022 forecast for growth around 4%.\\n\\nChina\\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) for all of 2021 increased by 8.1%, according to preliminary National Bureau of Statistics estimates. For all of 2022, we anticipate GDP growth around 5%, a level that would likely be below an official growth target that we expect will be set in a range of 5% to 6%.\\n\\nHeadwinds include a \"zero-COVID\" policy that continues to result in broad lockdowns ahead of the forthcoming Lunar New Year and Beijing Winter Olympics.\\nGiven these headwinds, we expect below-consensus growth around 3.5% in the first quarter of 2022, followed by above-consensus growth around 5% in the second quarter on the strength of anticipated policy stimulus and tweaks to zero-COVID.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nCOVID-19 and developed-market central banks may influence how economies in emerging markets perform in 2022.\\n\\nCountries with a combination of high vaccine-acquired and infection-acquired immunity to COVID-19, largely in Latin America but also in emerging Europe, will be supported simply by being able to keep their economies open.\\nCountries primarily in emerging Asia with less immunity could be hampered by continued virus vulnerability.\\nWe foresee emerging-market growth around 5.5% in 2022, with diminished global liquidity a potential downside risk.\\n\\nInflation will remain elevated through the first half of 2022\\nThe Consumer Price Index in the United States rose by 7% in December compared with December 2020, the largest 12-month increase since June 1982. The gauge rose by 0.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis in December compared with November, less than November\\'s 0.8% rise.\\n\\nVanguard estimates that the effects from supply constraints will persist into 2022 before inflation normalizes gradually toward the pre-pandemic trend.\\nWe foresee inflation remaining elevated before slowing in the second half of 2022, bringing the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) for year-end 2022 in the range of 2.3%–2.6% year-over-year.\\n\\nA revised outlook for when the FED will hike rates\\nAmid heightened inflation, falling unemployment, and increasing wage pressures, we believe the Fed will begin a rate-hike cycle in the first half of 2022, and perhaps as early as its March meeting depending on wage and inflation data in the interim.\\n\\nWe anticipate at least two quarter-point hikes in 2022 to the Fed’s target range for its federal funds rate, with additional policy-tightening likely warranted, whether through balance sheet reduction or one or two additional policy rate hikes.\\nVanguard believes that the Federal Reserve may need to raise its target for short-term interest rates to 3% from its current range of 0%–0.25%. That would require steady rate hikes over the next few years, to a degree that markets haven’t priced in beyond 2022.\\nThe delicate position for the Fed is to tighten policy enough to moderate inflation pressures without doing so too aggressively and ending the business cycle prematurely, according to a new Q&A with Vanguard economists Josh Hirt, Asawari Sathe, and Adam Schickling.\\nBond investors should welcome the prospect of higher interest rates. Although rising rates may produce modest negative returns for a time, they’re a long-term positive.\\nIn a recent commentary, Vanguard Global Chief Economist Joe Davis noted that, “In my view, markets are underestimating the degree to which central banks will need to use their powerful tools to pull inflation back to acceptable levels.”\\n\\nLabor demand begins to push wages up\\nA second straight below-consensus headline job-creation figure in the United States once again underestimated the labor market\\'s strength. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 199,000 jobs were created in December and the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%.\\n\\nVanguard anticipates further labor market tightening with continued upward wage pressure amid strong demand for workers.\\nWe expect the unemployment rate to fall below its pre-pandemic level toward the end of summer in 2022.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInflation won’t come down magically\\nOur global chief economist explains why central banks will need to act decisively to rein in accelerating inflation.View article\\n\\n\\n\\nThe thinking behind the Fed\\'s coming rate-hike cycle\\nWith inflation at multidecade highs, see why the Federal Reserve appears prepared to raise its key interest rate target.View article'},\n",

       "  'content': \"At Vanguard, we've always emphasized the importance of investing for the long term. The example of two recent U.S. equity market trading days helps reinforce that message.\\nOn January 20, the markets rose solidly throughout the day, with the Nasdaq, best-known for technology stocks, up nearly 2% at its highest point. But the gains evaporated in a flurry of late selling. Just two business days later, on January 24, the situation presented itself in reverse. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of the largest U.S. companies was down by as much as 4% yet finished in positive territory after a late-day surge.\\nAnyone who hadn't paid attention to the wild swings may have thought that stocks' daily movements were unremarkable. We've always believed that, for long-term investors, not paying attention to the day-to-day is a wise strategy.\\nSeveral factors suggest more volatility ahead\\nIt hasn't been possible, of course, to avoid the developments that have so roiled the financial markets in 2022. Two of the biggest—accelerating inflation and a pandemic that just won't quit—we're living with every day. Throw in a Federal Reserve that we believe will need to act decisively to contain inflation, as Vanguard's global chief economist, Joe Davis, recently wrote, and it's not hard to imagine more volatility ahead, along with the potential for losses in a stock markets that low interest rates have fueled.\\nBut it remains possible to maintain perspective through understanding history. Volatility, as the illustration shows, is a constant that tends to spike when stock markets endure valleys.\\nA history of volatility and long-term gains\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, using data from Refinitiv Datastream through January 21, 2022. Data accessed on January 24, 2022.\\nNotes: Intraday volatility is calculated as the daily range of trading prices ([high-low]/opening price) for the S&P 500 Index. Periods of extended volatility above historical averages have at times resulted in sharp losses during the period, as shown. The index value has also risen during periods of extended high volatility.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhat investors should keep sight of is that, over time, these inevitable valleys have given way to higher peaks. It's why we continue to invest to finance our long-term goals, such as retirement. And it should be our goals that govern our approach to investing. These goals, as Vanguard's principles for investing success emphasizes, should be built on realistic assumptions for investing returns.\\nA time to embrace balance and discipline\\nThe Vanguard Economic and Market Outlook for 2022 notes our guarded, though not bearish, long-term equity return outlooks. The course of the year ahead will be influenced by how policymakers remove from still-growing economies the strong fiscal and monetary support that had been required to withstand the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nOur outlook for fixed income is more sanguine; although interest rates remain historically low, modest rises since 2020 have moved our return outlooks commensurately higher.\\xa0\\nPolicymakers face a balancing act in the months ahead, one that could carry significant implications for economic growth, inflation, and investment returns. Their jobs won't be easy. Investors, meanwhile, may find their discipline challenged by markets that have approached or already entered corrections, or falls of 10% or more from recent highs.\\nOur message for investors, as always: Maintain perspective, tune out the day-to-day noise that can lead to impulsive decisions, be true to your goals, and put your faith in a history that has rewarded those who embrace the long term.\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.\\nInvestments in bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'With inflation at multidecade highs, the Federal Reserve appears prepared to raise its key interest rate target, perhaps as early as March. In this Q&A, Vanguard economists Josh Hirt, Asawari Sathe, and Adam Schickling discuss inflation, labor, and the risks of the Fed’s hiking rates either too aggressively or not aggressively enough.\\nIn a related commentary, Vanguard global chief economist Joe Davis discusses why central banks need to use their powerful tools to rein in inflation and why, long-term, that can be good for investors.\\nWhat challenges does the Fed face in deciding when to raise rates and by how much?\\nJosh: The Fed\\'s mandate from Congress is to ensure price stability and maximum sustainable employment. The broadest U.S. inflation measure is higher than it\\'s been in nearly 40 years, and the unemployment rate is falling fast toward a pre-pandemic level that was itself at a 50-year low.\\nThe Fed\\'s biggest challenge is the lack of clarity in key areas of the economy. Beyond the immediate impact on activity, the effects of the COVID-19 Omicron variant on the labor market and inflation are unknown. Omicron also has the potential to exacerbate global supply-chain issues. The Fed ideally would want a clearer read into the underlying strength of the economy as fiscal support wanes before deciding to tighten conditions.\\nWhat is Vanguard\\'s view on when the Fed will raise rates and by how much?\\nJosh: We\\'ve just revised our view on when the Fed will likely need to raise rates, from the second half of 2022 to the first half, perhaps as early as March. Wage inflation data will be important to that timing. We believe the Fed will initiate at least two quarter-point rate hikes in 2022, and that additional policy tightening will likely be warranted, either through a reduction in the Fed\\'s bond holdings or through one or two more policy rate increases.\\nHow will inflation expectations likely play into the Fed’s interest rate decisions?\\nAsawari: Inflation expectations shouldn\\'t change much in response to the latest data. If they do and continue to push higher, they\\'ll have become unanchored, which would allow wages and prices to begin to spiral out of control. We haven\\'t reached that point, but even before more recent concerns materialized about wage inflation—which tends to indicate more persistent inflation—we saw shorter-term and then some longer-term inflation expectations rising. We\\'re far away from saying inflation expectations have become unanchored, but the Fed won’t want to risk that and is likely prepared to act to fend it off.\\nWhat is the Fed looking for regarding the other portion of its mandate—\"maximum sustainable employment,\" also called \"full employment\"?\\nAdam: The Fed will want to see in the January employment data what the Omicron wave has meant for the labor market. But the traditional definition of full employment, in its rawest sense, is that everyone who wants a job has one or can easily get one. By almost every labor market metric, we\\'re very close. There are still a couple of million unemployed people who say they want a job, and that cohort is about 600,000 larger than it was pre-COVID. That includes some who can be very selective in the job and wages they accept. We expect that cohort to contract quickly.\\nGiven these insights, what does the Fed need to consider about the pace and duration of the forthcoming hiking cycle?\\nJosh: Our view is that, over the next few years, the Fed will ultimately need to raise rates to a level that restricts the economy sufficiently to contain inflation—by our estimates likely around 3%. That is roughly 100 basis points higher than where the market has been pricing.1\\nOur view considers our estimate of the neutral rate and inflation around the Fed\\'s target level.2\\nThe delicate position for the Fed is to tighten policy enough to moderate inflation pressures without doing so too aggressively and ending the business cycle prematurely. But being too easy at this point likely invites a greater risk. If the Fed were to lose control of inflation or inflation expectations, there\\'s a range of potential outcomes that could have negative effects on the real economy, the value of assets, and people\\'s standards of living. We expect these considerations to be part of Fed policy debates.\\n\\xa0\\n1 A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\\n2 The neutral rate is the rate at which policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive.\\n\\n\\n\\nWebcast replay: 2022 economic outlook and portfolio opportunities Recorded January 12 at 1 p.m., Eastern time\\nHear fresh perspectives on key economic issues and market forces, plus practical suggestions for using those insights to make portfolio-construction decisions for your clients.Watch the replay\\n\\n\\n\\nVanguard economic and market outlook: 2022\\nGet Vanguard\\'s perspectives on key economic issues and market forces, as well as practical suggestions for how you can apply those perspectives to the portfolio-construction and product choices you make for your clients.Read the outlook'},\n",

       "  'content': 'To appreciate the strength of economic recovery from the sharp 2020 COVID-19 recession, look no further than the labor markets. Unemployment rates around the world have fallen toward pre-pandemic lows. In most developed markets, pretty much anyone who wants a job can find one.\\nFewer workers are participating in the labor force than before the pandemic, and the higher wages they can secure as employers compete for them threaten to take already accelerating inflation to a new, more worrisome level. Wage inflation is \"sticky.\" Although it takes time for wages to climb in tandem with broader prices, when they do, they\\'re fully along for the ride and ready to jump into the driver\\'s seat.\\nCentral banks have underestimated this strength in labor markets and the growing wage pressures. In my view, markets are underestimating the degree to which central banks will need to use their powerful tools to pull inflation back to acceptable levels.\\nHigher rates are in the U.S. economy\\'s best interest, a point I emphasized in a previous commentary. Vanguard believes that the Federal Reserve may need to raise its target for short-term interest rates to 3% from its current range of 0%–0.25%. That would require steady rate hikes over the next few years, to a degree that markets haven\\'t priced in beyond 2022.\\nIn a Q&A, Vanguard economists Josh Hirt, Asawari Sathe, and Adam Schickling discuss labor, inflation, our 3% figure, and the potential risks of the Fed moving too aggressively or not aggressively enough.\\nWhy higher rates can be a good thing\\nBond investors should welcome the prospect of higher interest rates. Although rising rates may produce modest negative returns for a time, they\\'re a long-term positive. We recently wrote about the silver lining in rising rates—how investors with a longer horizon than their portfolio\\'s duration stand to benefit.1 Raising short-term rates should also forestall a rise in long-term bond yields because expectations of future inflation should not rise further.\\nEquity investors may feel less hopeful, and that\\'s understandable. In recent years they\\'ve come to enjoy some heady returns, fueled by negative after-inflation interest rates. The removal of such stimulus as central banks address inflation suggests turbulence ahead.\\nBut negative real interest rates and the higher equity valuations they\\'ve promoted have come at a cost of future returns. That\\'s why our long-term outlook for equities, as we discuss in the Vanguard economic and market outlook for 2022, is so guarded.\\nThe theme of our annual economic outlook, \"Striking a better balance,\" acknowledges the challenges that policymakers face in removing monetary and fiscal support that propped up economies during an unprecedented crisis. Surging inflation won’t come down magically. The path for central banks is clear.\\nAccelerating inflation is a threat to economies that otherwise remain fundamentally sound.

       "  'content': \"ETFs are enjoying explosive growth (Figure 1) because they offer potential advantages that include flexibility, diversification, lower costs, and potential tax benefits. These advantages have continued to provide advisors and their clients with an excellent chance of achieving investment success. To understand why the ETF market is so efficient and so resilient at a time of record inflows, exploding assets, and market volatility, it's necessary to explore a process that includes a number of market participants working together to meet investor demand.\\nThis elaborate process involving investors, issuers, exchanges, and market makers helps produce more favorable outcomes for ETF investors by increasing liquidity and lowering costs through tighter bid-ask spreads. As ETFs continue to evolve, investors and advisors can benefit from a closer look to help them understand how these key players shape the ETF landscape and help drive efficiencies.\\nFigure 1. ETF trading volume has exploded over the last 20 years\\nSources: Bloomberg, Morningstar, and Vanguard, 2022.\\n\\nThe ETF ecosystem explained\\nETFs offer multiple layers of liquidity that benefit investors and markets. One layer is the secondary market, or the trading of ETF shares between two market participants on ETF exchanges or other trading venues. An additional layer of liquidity comes from the primary market, where ETF shares are created or redeemed in exchange for the underlying basket of securities. The primary market is what helps keep ETF prices in line with their fair value and directly influences the ETF liquidity profile that clients experience when trading ETFs in the secondary market.\\nTo facilitate these layers of liquidity, there are a number of participants in the ETF ecosystem, including investors, issuers, exchanges, and market makers (Figure 2).\\nFigure 2. A deeper look at the key ETF participants\\nSource: Vanguard, 2022.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nInvestors place orders to buy and sell ETFs on exchanges and often interact with the other key players. Demand from investors helps shape the ETF products that come to market.\\nETF issuers are asset management firms such as Vanguard that develop, register, and distribute ETFs. Issuer responsibilities include:\\n\\nStructuring the ETF product. This includes selecting the benchmark, setting fees, and determining the investment approach for each ETF. The way the product is structured will directly affect the transaction costs that investors pay when trading the ETF in the secondary market.\\nControlling ETF creation and redemption activity. Issuers are responsible for the process that allows new ETF shares to both enter and be removed from the market. This creation/redemption process is referred to as the primary market; it allows ETFs to trade efficiently and ensures significant liquidity for ETF investors trading in the secondary market.\\n\\nThere are three ETF exchanges in the United States: NYSE Arca, CBOE, and Nasdaq. In addition to providing a listing venue for ETF products, these exchanges create orderly markets by ensuring that investor limit orders (which investors use to specify a trade price) are held to the national best-bid and best-offer price. Exchanges also incentivize market makers to provide liquidity in listed ETF products, which helps ensure that there will be someone on the other side of an investor's order to buy or sell an ETF.\\nETF market makers consist of firms that provide two-sided (buy and sell) quotes in ETFs and execute investor transactions. By constantly posting orders to buy and sell ETF shares to meet investor demand, they are the primary providers of liquidity for ETFs.\\nAuthorized participants (APs) are a type of market maker. They are financial institutions that have contracts in place with ETF issuers that enable them to create and redeem ETF shares. There is often a misconception that investors need to transact with an AP when placing large block ETF orders, because, they believe, the AP is better positioned to trade the ETF. This may not always be the case and in many instances, a market maker that is not an AP is better suited to trade a large ETF block. It's important to consult with the issuer's capital markets desk to understand which market makers may be better suited for large ETF trades. This decision often depends on the product type and asset class.\\nIf demand is heavy for a particular ETF, the price of that ETF may increase slightly above its fair value. In such cases, market makers will naturally be on the other side of the trade selling ETF shares to meet investor demand. If a market maker doesn't have enough shares in its inventory to meet client purchases, it will short or sell the ETF and look for ways to hedge risk, while contacting the ETF issuer to create new shares. This activity results in three positive developments:\\n\\nIt injects new ETF supply into the market, helping keep investor executions close to fair value;\\nIt allows market makers to minimize risk by covering their short positions.\\nIt provides market makers with an arbitrage opportunity to buy the underlying basket of securities slightly below the ETF price, which helps drive competition for ETF order flow and anchors the ETF price to the true value of the fund.\\n\\nThe four key players of the ETF ecosystem create an interdependent framework that shapes the ETF trading experience and makes the ETF market much more liquid and efficient. Investor demand helps shape the ETF products that come to market. Issuers structure ETF products, which directly affects investor transaction costs. Market makers post quotes on exchanges to satisfy ETF investor demand and work with ETF issuers to create and redeem shares to offset their risk, driven by investor trading. The dynamic between market makers and issuers helps keep the ETF price in line with fair value through the creation and redemption process. Exchanges create an orderly market for investors to interact with market makers.\\nThe result of this intricate process is lower costs, enhanced liquidity, and greater trading efficiencies—all of which benefit investors.Notes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs,\\xa0obtain a prospectus\\xa0(or summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-997-2798 to request one.

These findings offer investors the confidence that these indexes can serve as close substitutes for their underlying benchmarks while allowing them to express their ESG values in portfolios.\\nFor illustrative purposes, we present the performance statistics for the FTSE US All Cap Choice Index, which uses the FTSE USA All Cap benchmark as a starting universe, for the six-year period ended March 31, 2021. As shown, US Choice outperformed the underlying benchmark\\'s annualized gain of roughly 13.7% by 1.40 percentage points, with comparable volatility. The tracking error over this period was 1.26%.Performance statistics—April 2015 to March 2021\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nUSA All Cap\\nUS All Cap Choice\\n\\n\\nAverage return (annualized)\\n13.68%\\n15.07%\\n\\n\\nVolatility\\n15.40%\\n15.35%\\n\\n\\nReturn/Vol ratio\\n0.89\\n0.98\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nExcess return\\n\\xa0\\n1.40%\\n\\n\\nTracking error\\n\\xa0\\n1.26%\\n\\n\\nInformation ratio\\n\\xa0\\n1.11\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: FTSE Russell.

During the long climb upward of bull markets, portfolios can easily skew out of balance as outperforming holdings make up an increasingly larger portion of a client\\'s assets and create larger potential tax liabilities. Plans may require adjusting in light of new information.\\nA down market affords clients a chance to redeploy their capital in ways that, potentially, could more efficiently advance them toward achieving their financial goals.\\nThe starting point for your conversation with each client will vary. You can prioritize your area of focus by applying a \"three As\" (assess, address, audit) framework to the client\\'s situation. But, generally speaking, your cleaning up of client portfolios and plans should include reviews of their:\\n\\nAsset allocation and related issues.\\nTax efficiency via asset location and other means.\\nRetirement strategies.\\n\\nAsset allocation\\nAssessing this dimension includes rebalancing—an activity that under ordinary market conditions might seem routine. Amid a downturn, however, clients\\' questions or concerns about rebalancing may open the door to a broader conversation about their risk tolerance. Has their appetite for risk changed since you originally helped them build a portfolio and accompanying financial plan? Has volatility revealed a gap between clients\\' previously stated risk tolerance and their actual appetite for risk in the moment?\\nOther considerations include evaluating the portfolio for the merits of active versus passive holdings; opportunities to swap high-cost funds and ETFs with low-cost replacements; and the chance to dilute and diversify concentrated equity positions, when share prices (and, thus, the possibility of adverse tax implications) are lower.\\nTax efficiency\\nYou can examine the tax efficiency of a client’s account both at the fund level and at the account level.\\n\\nFund level: Are funds (or the holdings in them) tax-efficient? If any are not (for example, a fund with a high turnover rate), can they be replaced with something that is?\\nAccount level: This might be the time to consider rebalancing a client\\'s accounts in a way similar to rebalancing their assets. At the outset, you may have advised the client to hold a certain percentage of assets in tax-advantaged accounts and the remainder in taxable accounts. Over time, as certain investments and asset classes outperform others, that ratio will increasingly skew from the original policy asset location. Thus, an opportunity arises to shift assets to once again align with the agreed-upon policy.\\n\\nFor some clients, it could make sense to consider a Roth conversion. In converting a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA, an investor shifts the timing for the payment of taxes on their investments.\\nWith traditional retirement savings accounts, the investor makes tax-exempt contributions in the accumulation stage and pays taxes on distributions in retirement. Conversely, with a Roth, the investor makes contributions with after-tax dollars; the investor can take distributions tax-exempt, if certain time-of-ownership and age requirements are met.\\nWhen converting a traditional account (or a portion of it) to a Roth, taxes must be paid upfront on the amount being converted. During a downturn, when most asset prices are depressed, the tax bill will probably be lower than it would be were the assets trading at their \"normal\" valuations. Assuming those assets eventually rise in value again, performing a Roth conversion in a down market can provide a significant tax savings immediately. But it can also prove beneficial down the road, when the investor can potentially realize market gains and spend from the account tax-exempt, as well as enjoy other advantages.*\\nDetermining if a Roth conversion is appropriate involves weighing trade-offs and making assumptions about future taxation levels, among other calculations. As an advisor, you\\'re uniquely suited to help clients navigate such a complex choice.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Vanguard's Tax-Planning Series explores how advisors can deepen their client relationships as they help clients minimize the burden of taxes and more efficiently reach their financial goals.\\nIt's the end of the year, and many clients might be in the giving spirit when it comes to causes they support and believe in. That generosity probably stops, however, at giving the government more than is absolutely necessary in taxes.\\nA well-planned charitable giving strategy can help clients support their causes and reduce income and capital gains taxes. Given the resilient stock market and tax provisions enacted through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, many charitably inclined clients can be particularly well served by an effective giving strategy.\\nUnder the 2017 tax act, the standard deduction available to taxpayers increased substantially, while other deductions were eliminated or rendered moot. For example, the standard deduction available to a single person rose from $6,350 in 2017 to $12,550 in the 2021 tax year; and for a married couple filing jointly, it rose from $12,700 in 2017 to $25,100 in 2021. Other deductions less than those amounts were eliminated or rendered moot under the aforementioned act.\\nGiving ahead of schedule\\nOne work-around is for taxpayers to accelerate their charitable giving.\\nTaxpayers can roll several years' worth of contributions into one, in order to exceed the higher standard deductions brought into force by the tax act.\\nIt may seem like a lot at once, but at least a portion is then tax-deductible for that year, and the taxpayer is funding a charity.\\nTaxpayers also might consider engaging a donor-advised fund, a vehicle which gives taxpayers greater flexibility in how to meet their charitable giving goals.\\nThe challenge is that many charities depend on recurring gifts and factor them into their operating budgets. A donor-advised fund, such as one of the options offered by Vanguard Charitable, allows a donor to make a large, tax-deductible gift in one year, and then regulate its disbursement over ensuing years. Meanwhile, the dollars have the potential to grow tax-free in the account.\\nSay, for example, a client gave $50,000 to Vanguard Charitable in a donor-advised fund.\\nThen, in each of the next five years, they could indicate which charities were to receive an allotted $10,000 from the donor-advised fund. In the meantime, if the market were to go up, any invested money would grow as well. Hypothetically, the $50,000 fund investment could become $60,000 with market appreciation—and the growth would be tax-free.\\nPotential advantages of using a donor-advised fund\\nThe following example assumes that the persons involved are single and take the standard deduction for federal income taxes, except in the first year for the person who donated $50,000 to a donor-advised fund. The money in the donor-advised fund is projected to grow at 6% a year. Any taxes saved on capital gains realized by donating appreciated securities or property are in addition to any tax savings shown below.\\nSee how much gifts of different sizes will save you in taxes in the first year using Vanguard Charitable's Tax Savings Calculator.\\n* Each year.\\nNotes: The assumed 6% rate of return is not guaranteed. It is an illustrative example of a long-term average return on a balanced investment of stocks and bonds. Market returns are not constant and will fluctuate annually. Lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains may make the first scenario more favorable and the difference between the first- and second-scenario balances less. Any future changes in the tax treatment of investment earnings or a rate of return that is lower than the assumed rate of return may further affect the comparison. Investors should consider their time horizon and current and expected future tax rates before making an investment decision.\\nSource: Vanguard\\n\\nShowing appreciation … with appreciated securities\\nThere’s another potential benefit as well: a reduction in capital gains taxes. Tax-deductible gifts can include appreciated securities. Even complex assets such as hedge funds, LLCs, or even art or real estate can be donated.\\nBy donating an appreciated security or property in-kind, the donor receives full value for the tax deduction and pays no capital gains on the appreciation. Meanwhile, the charity, or donor-advised fund, can sell the security or property, and it pays no capital gains taxes.\\xa0\\nFor instance, a client could decide to give $50,000 in appreciated stock to a donor-advised fund. The donor-advised fund could then sell it tax-free, invest the proceeds in a diversified portfolio, and allow the portfolio to grow. The client could then give to charity a percentage or dollar amount every year. The fund can be used flexibly to meet the client's charitable needs and goals: Perhaps they want to use the fund for immediate needs, such as disaster relief; or maybe they want to use it to save for a longer-term purpose, such as creating a scholarship fund or funding a hospital wing.\\nThe advisor advantage\\nThere are other giving options that many eligible investors might not consider without being informed of them by an advisor. For instance, qualified charitable donations, or QCDs, allow individuals aged 70½ and older to give IRA funds to charity rather than taking them as IRS-mandated required minimum distributions. In so doing, up to $100,000 of the IRA funds are exempt from taxes annually. It’s worth noting that donor-advised funds, however, currently cannot accept QCDs.\\nHaving conversations on such matters can go a long way toward helping you better understand your clients. Asking why making charitable contributions matters to them is a uniquely human—and meaningful—gesture that builds trust and deepens your relationship.\\nOn a practical level, reviewing these types of giving options can increase clients' satisfaction with their charitable giving efforts, increase the amount they're able to give, and save them tax expenditures in the process.\\n\\xa0\\nFounded by Vanguard in 1997 as an independent 501(c)(3) organization, Vanguard Charitable strongly aligns with Vanguard's principled investment philosophy and believes in the importance of long-term, strategic charitable planning through a donor-advised fund. \\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal.\\nWe recommend that you consult a tax or financial advisor about your individual situation.\"},\n",

This has led to ESG becoming the topic of many of your client conversations.\\nAs investor appetite for ESG increases, clients may wonder how such a shift to ESG investments will impact their risk and return expectations. Have Investors Paid a Performance Price? Examining the Behavior of ESG Equity Funds (PDF), a research paper published by Vanguard Investment Strategy Group\\'s Jan-Carl Plagge and Doug Grim in The Journal of Portfolio Management examines whether ESG equity fund strategies come with a cost in the form of lower expected returns, higher volatility, or both.\\nESG fund performance varies\\nMr. Plagge and Mr. Grim looked at ESG mutual funds and ETFs focused on U.S.-listed stocks and investigated differences in their gross returns and volatility (standard deviation of returns) over a 15-year period compared with the FTSE USA All Cap Index. They distinguished between index and active funds and between funds that apply explicit exclusions and those that do not. Dividing the sample period into three five-year periods, they found a high level of dispersion for both risk and return among ESG strategies. (See chart below.)\\n\"We found funds with higher returns and higher risk, lower returns and lower risk, higher returns and lower risk, and lower returns and higher risk than their investment universe,\" Mr. Grim said. \"Overall, our findings suggest that ESG funds have neither systematically higher nor systematically lower raw returns or risk than the broader market.\"\\nESG funds produce mixed risk and return results versus the broad market\\nNotes: The data points reflect the annualized five-year standard deviation and gross return of each fund minus the broad U.S. equity market as proxied by the FTSE USA All Cap Index. ESG fund categories include index funds, active funds, exclusion based, and nonexclusion based.

To control for factor tilts, they evaluated the performance of ESG strategies against that of each of the factors in the Fama-French five factor model: market, size, valuation (value/growth), profitability (quality), and capital investment.\\nThe market factor proved, as one would expect, highly significant across the entire fund universe. The influence of style factors, on the other hand, was much less consistent. Some ESG funds had statistically significant and positive exposures to a given factor, while others had a significant but negative exposure to the same factor—and some had no noteworthy exposure to that factor at all.\\nMany of the funds performed quite differently compared with the market-capitalization-weighted U.S. equity market. \"However, after controlling for the impact of known sources of risk—that is, market- and style-factor exposures—the majority of ESG funds did not produce statistically significant positive or negative gross alpha,\" Mr. Plagge said. \"Return and risk differences of ESG funds can be significant, but they appear to be mainly driven by fund-specific criteria rather than a homogeneous ESG factor.\"\\nBecause ESG funds often favor new technologies and avoid certain sectors, such as those relating to fossil fuels, the researchers were interested in the effects of such systematic deviations in industry exposures. Funds in the sample tended to be slightly underweighted in finance, energy, minerals, and consumer services and slightly overweighted in health and technology. However, the authors found the effects of these deviations on relative fund performance to be very small in median terms when sampled on a quarterly basis across the 15-year period with all funds observed.\\nMr. Grim and Mr. Plagge then calculated net (after cost) alphas and analyzed their relationship to expense ratios. There was again a significant dispersion in the results (See chart below). Consistent with other research, higher expenses generally were associated with lower (or negative) net alphas.\\nHigher ESG fund management expenses tend to be associated with lower net alpha\\nNotes: Relationship between net alpha and average over monthly expense ratios. Mostly expense ratios are calculated as the difference between gross and net returns. The exhibit includes data from the five-year periods: 2004 to 2008, 2009 to 2013, and from 2014 to 2018.

Just as important, the year\\'s end presents a chance for clients to shore up possibly depleted accounts, plan for tax-advantaged contribution deadlines, and tend to health care tasks that have a significant financial component.\\nThis article provides a partial checklist of items to review with clients in assessing the year that\\'s concluding and preparing for the one that lies ahead.\\nOne way to start is by acknowledging to clients that things still might not feel like \"normal.\" The end of 2021 finds the world still emerging from a global health crisis and the United States bracing for potential changes in tax policy. These are factors you might consider in the course of your planning.\\nIf we revisit the three As (assess, address, audit) framework of financial advisor action, the most relevant step to year-end planning is the audit phase. In this step, you evaluate the results of actions taken during the year and discuss them with clients—demonstrating your value in the process.

It was a sobering reminder of the importance of having quickly accessible emergency savings. Depending on clients\\' circumstances, now could be a good time to talk to them about rebuilding savings they may have used during the pandemic or paying back early distributions from retirement accounts, as they were permitted under the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act (more on the act below).\\nHealth care planning\\nHealth Savings Account (HSA)\\nAre clients enrolled in an HSA as part of an eligible high-deductible health plan taking advantage of the potential triple tax benefit by investing their contributions? Are they properly prioritizing their contributions among their HSA and other investing accounts?\\nMedicare\\nAre clients near the eligibility age of 65 for receiving Medicare insurance benefits? If so, you should ask them about their plans for enrolling before their 65th birthday—lifelong premium penalties may apply if they sign up after turning 65.\\nIf clients already participate in Medicare, are their current coverage elections—including those for prescription drugs—still adequate and appropriate? (Each year, Medicare’s October 15–December 7 open enrollment period for current enrollees offers a chance to make changes.) Vanguard provides a \"prioritize, evaluate, choose\" to help you and your clients streamline the potentially confusing process of selecting a Medicare plan.\\n\\nPrioritizeAsk a client: What do you want out of your coverage? Consider the trade-offs between affordability, flexibility, cost certainty, and worst-case protection.\\nEvaluateClients should map the features they find most important to the strengths and weaknesses of different coverage types.\\nChooseResearch specific policies. Ensure that clients enroll on time to avoid penalties and coverage gaps.Charitable giving\\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the standard deduction available to taxpayers increased substantially. For the 2021 tax year, it is $12,550 (for persons filing individually) or $25,100 (for persons who are married and filing jointly). Other deductions less than those amounts were eliminated or rendered moot under the aforementioned act.\\nAccelerated giving\\nOne work-around is for taxpayers to accelerate their charitable giving—taxpayers can roll several years\\' worth of contributions into one, in order to exceed the higher standard deductions brought into force by the 2017 tax act.\\nFor instance, a donor-advised fund (DAF)—such as the options offered by Vanguard Charitable1—allows a donor to make a large, tax-deductible gift in one year and then regulate its disbursement over ensuing years. Meanwhile, the dollars have the potential to grow tax-exempt in the account.\\nTo see your potential savings with this method, try Vanguard Charitable’s Tax Savings Calculator.\\nCARES Act, and Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Relief Act deductions\\nUnder the CARES Act, which was made law in 2020, additional deductions became available—up to $300 per taxpayer ($600 for a married couple) in annual charitable contributions. This is available only to people who take the standard deduction (for taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions). (This temporary provision was extended through tax year 2021 by the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Relief Act of 2020.) As an “above the line” adjustment to income, it will reduce a donor’s adjusted gross income (AGI), and thereby reduce taxable income. A donation to a DAF does not qualify for this deduction.\\nHigher charitable deduction limits extended\\nAs part of the law, individuals and corporations that itemize can deduct much greater amounts of their contributions. Individuals can elect to deduct donations up to 100% of their 2021 AGI (up from 60% before the CARES Act). Corporations may deduct up to 25% of taxable income, up from the pre-CARES limit of 10%. The newer deduction is for gifts that go to a public charity. The old deduction rules apply to gifts to private foundations. The higher deduction does not apply to donations directly to a DAF (more on the CARES Act below).\\nQualified charitable donations (QCDs)\\nQCDs allow individuals aged 70½ and older to give traditional IRA funds to charity rather than taking them as IRS-mandated required minimum distributions (RMDs). In so doing, up to $100,000 of the traditional IRA funds may be exempt from taxes. It\\'s worth noting that donor-advised funds, however, currently cannot accept QCDs.\\nOther contributions\\nRetirement accounts\\nYou can remind clients that, generally, the deadline for making 2021 contributions to 401(k) accounts is December 31, depending on their employer\\'s retirement investing plans (the IRS, however, permits contributions to retirement accounts until the filing deadline—for the 2021 tax year, it\\'s April 15, 2022).\\n529 plans\\nMost states set December 31 as the deadline—for state-tax-benefit purposes—for contributions to 529 education accounts, although six states (Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin) set deadlines of April 15 of the following year.\\nImportant rules changes\\nRMDs\\nStarting in 2020, clients are no longer required to take RMDs on qualified retirement accounts at age 70½. For account holders who turn 70½ after December 31, 2019, RMDs don’t become mandatory until they reach age 72. The CARES Act affects RMDs this year even further (see below).\\nThe CARES Act\\nIn addition to its charitable giving features mentioned above, the CARES Act introduced several provisions with potential planning implications. With those provisions expiring, it\\'s worth reviewing the changes with clients:\\n\\nWaiver of the early withdrawal penalty on eligible retirement accounts—to put money in the pockets of individuals affected by the pandemic, the act suspended the 10% penalty for early withdrawals of coronavirus-related distributions up to $100,000 made between January 1 and December 31, 2020. While the penalty-free early withdrawal ability disappeared in 2021, individuals still have the opportunity to spread the tax on those withdrawals over three years; and they have three years from the time of distribution to return the money to their accounts.\\nTemporary waiver for RMDs—this temporary waiver applied to both 2020 RMDs and RMDs of those who turned 70½ in 2019 with RMDs that ordinarily would have come due in April 2020. The RMD was restored in 2021, so remind affected clients to take distributions as applicable. Anyone age 72 or older as of December 31, 2021, must take their RMD by year-end to avoid the 50% penalty―unless this is their first RMD, in which case they have until April 1, 2022.\\nFor small business employers and the self-employed, the act permitted a deferral of payroll taxes in 2020 to help businesses affected by the pandemic; those deferred taxes were to be repaid through the end of 2021 (and the IRS requires employers to collect and pay the 2020 payroll taxes even for former workers).\\n\\nRemember the people behind the portfolios\\nBy any measure, the extended uncertainty of the past couple of years has proven challenging. Your year-end check-in with clients serves as a valuable touchpoint. Clients want to know that you\\'re helping to efficiently grow their wealth. But it\\'s especially important to hear out other concerns clients may express:\\n\\nThey may feel exhausted after nearly two years of living and coping with the coronavirus pandemic.\\nThey might be dealing with, or at least worried about, the effects of longer-than-expected inflation that has accompanied global supply shortages.\\nThey may have concerns about how other issues—the ones in news headlines or more personal ones—could affect their well-being and their ability to reach financial and life goals.\\n\\nIt\\'s times like these when your role as a listener first, and emotional circuit breaker second, can deliver tremendous value and build trust. The Vanguard Advisor\\'s Alpha® framework is built around providing you with the tools to help unlock your value to clients, communicate that value to them, and strengthen client relationships.\\n1 Founded by Vanguard in 1997 as an independent 501(c)(3) organization, Vanguard Charitable strongly aligns with Vanguard\\'s principled investment philosophy and believes in the importance of long-term, strategic charitable planning through a donor-advised fund.\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal.

We foresee growth of around 4% for 2022.\\nConditions for continuing U.S. growth look favorable, even relative to pre-pandemic conditions.\\nUnlike the abrupt shutdown of the economy early in the pandemic, the reopening has been a more drawn-out process and, as such, the near term will continue to be excessively volatile, adding a high degree of uncertainty to the longer-run implications (see figure).\\n\\nThe key drivers of U.S. inflation are sending mixed signals\\nNotes: The chart depicts the absolute difference in standard deviation of observed readings from the 2019 trend. Dotted lines represent Vanguard forecasted values.\\nSources: Vanguard forecast and calculations, based on Refinitiv data. As of November 12, 2021.\\n\\nEuro area\\nVanguard expects the pace of growth to moderate, a natural slowing at this stage of economic recovery from the pandemic.\\n\\nCOVID-19 continues to be a concern—new cases topped 50,000 in Germany for the first time on November 11—and high energy prices weigh on household finances.\\nA rapid unwinding of supply bottlenecks that would boost manufacturing represents a risk to the upside, one especially pertinent to the euro area.\\nVanguard continues to see full-year 2021 euro area growth around 5% and 2022 growth around 4%.\\n\\nChina\\nWe foresee growth in the fourth quarter of around 1% compared with the third quarter, below trend, and of around 5% for all of 2022, below market expectations for growth around 5.5%.\\n\\nWe expect consumption recovery to remain muted, the property downturn to deepen and infrastructure investment to accelerate only after the National People's Congress in March.\\nWe expect the government to target growth around 5.5% for 2022; as such, we anticipate that it will need to tolerate an undershooting of its target or to introduce further stimulus measures.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nPositive health developments lead Vanguard to hold an above consensus view on 2022 growth in emerging markets of around 5.5% in 2022.\\n\\nWe anticipate that Latin America and emerging Asia, regions with high vaccine acceptance, will have vaccinated almost all eligible individuals who want to be vaccinated by the end of 2021.\\nWe expect the percentage of the vaccinated population to lag significantly behind in emerging Europe, where vaccine acceptance is low.\\nWe foresee vaccination rates in Africa, which have consistently lagged those of other regions, surpassing those in emerging Europe in the first half of 2022.\\n\\nThe Fed begins its tapering program\\nThe gradual removal of pandemic-era monetary policy accommodation in the United States has begun with the Federal Reserve’s announcement on November 3 that it would start to scale back its bond-buying program.\\n\\nThe Fed said it would reduce its purchases of Treasury securities by $10 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion per month so that November purchases total $70 billion and $35 billion, respectively, with a similar monthly reduction in purchases thereafter.\\nAt such a pace, the Fed's asset-purchase program will have wound down by the middle of 2022. The Fed said it was prepared to adjust the pace of purchases—up or down—as the economic outlook warranted.\\nThe move sets the stage for what Vanguard believes will be a late 2022 interest rate hike. If inflation evolves as Vanguard forecasts, it likely has already met its lift-off test and the Fed will turn its attention to the labor market to gauge the appropriate time for a rate hike\\n\\nWhat's next for U.S government funding?\\nThe threat of a U.S. government shutdown, a U.S. debt default, or both could arise in early December.\\n\\nTo avoid a shutdown in December, an omnibus appropriations bill funding the discretionary portion of the budget for the remainder of the fiscal year or another continuing resolution would need to be signed.\\nMeanwhile, Congress passed and the president on October 14 signed legislation to raise the U.S. debt ceiling by $480 billion, an amount expected to allow the government to pay its bills until at least December 3.\\nThe consequences of a U.S. debt default would be enormous—although Vanguard believes a U.S. debt default is unlikely.\\n\\nInflation likely to stay above 2%\\nVanguard’s medium-term outlook for inflation in the United States hasn’t materially changed despite a stronger-than-expected reading in October, although near-term inflation is likely to be pressured higher.\\n\\nCore Consumer Price Index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, reached 0.6% in October and 4.6% year-on-year. Strong readings over recent months have increased the possibility that supply constraints, labor shortages, and the effects of the economy’s reopening will take further time to normalize.\\nWe foresee inflation persisting above 2% toward the end of 2022. A risk that inflation persists at or above 3% by year-end 2022 would depend on broad wage gains taking hold.\\nVanguard sees the likelihood of strong wage gains in certain pandemic-affected sectors such as leisure and hospitality, but we see the risk of such strong gains across all industries as low.\\n\\nUnemployment continues falling\\nWith inflation likely to have already met the Federal Reserve’s criterion for an interest rate hike, we expect labor market developments to command attention in the coming months.\\n\\nThe unemployment rate fell from 4.8% to 4.6% in October, but we don’t expect the Fed to rely solely on that indicator in determining when to raise interest rates.\\nVanguard expects the unemployment rate to continue to fall, to just above 3% by the end of 2022, with labor-force participation peaking perhaps a full percentage point below its pre-pandemic level.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"Even during periods of strong market performance, not every investment will outperform market benchmarks. When clients' investment performance does not meet their expectations, it presents a great opportunity for advisors to incorporate holistic wealth and tax-planning discussions into client portfolio reviews.\\nBy developing a customized tax-loss harvesting (TLH) strategy in line with the profile of clients’ estimated capital gains, the market environment, and clients' personal tax situations, you can help to improve clients' after-tax returns.\\nHarvesting losses to offset gains\\nTLH involves realizing portfolio losses immediately and deferring expected capital gains. The value of TLH is twofold: potentially minimizing taxes over the investment horizon and deferring a current tax liability, with the extra cash flow earning a compounded market return over the investment horizon (see the following figure).\\nThe potential difference TLH can make\\nSource: Vanguard.\\nNote: This hypothetical illustration does not represent the return on any particular investment, and the rate is not guaranteed.\\n\\nFor many advisors and their clients, TLH is a year-end tactic to maximize portfolios' tax efficiency. However, by taking an annual approach, advisors may be missing attractive opportunities to harvest losses throughout the year. Additionally, using TLH software makes it possible to look for harvesting opportunities on a daily basis, which could result in a more sizable impact than monthly, quarterly, or year-end screening.\\nLooking across several wealth segments, the TLH value varies considerably among clients owing to differences in the market environment, tax rates, and capital gains. While TLH opportunities frequently present themselves during market declines, the strategy can also serve as a tactic in years when markets perform well.\\nThe next illustration shows that by evaluating a client's portfolio for losses on a daily basis, the potential TLH benefit is about 8 and 18 basis points (bps) greater, respectively, than with monthly and quarterly screening.\\nFrequency makes a difference in TLH benefit\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, using data from Qontigo.\\nNotes: Illustration depicts the annualized TLH benefit from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2019. The frequency on the x-axis indicates how often the portfolio was scanned for harvesting opportunities, which were identified as tax lots with at least a 10% loss relative to their cost basis. This analysis assumed quarterly cash flows of 25%, capital gains availability of 5% of the portfolio value, an eventual liquidation of 50%, a harvest tax rate of 32%, a liquidation tax rate of 15%, individual security-level harvesting, and a relative transaction cost of 25 bps. This hypothetical illustration does not represent the return on any particular investment, and the rate is not guaranteed.\\n\\nConsider direct indexing to save more\\nUsing a case study, Vanguard researchers explored the suitability of direct indexing for investors seeking daily tax-saving opportunities.1 Direct indexing (sometimes called personalized indexing) is a technology-driven investment solution that lets you offer high-net-worth clients custom portfolios at scale. This separately managed account strategy allows you to replicate an existing index while offering high-net-worth clients the expanded TLH opportunities that come with owning individual stocks and realizing losses daily to offset gains.\\nDifferent investors, different levels of TLH benefit\\nIn the following two illustrations, we use the example of four hypothetical investors to show how the TLH benefit differs across two different TLH strategies: one using index funds and the other using direct indexing.\\nFour TLH investor profiles\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, based on Federal Reserve Bulletin data (Neil Bhutta, Jesse Bricker, Andrew C. Chang, Lisa J. Dettling, Sarena Goodman, Joanne W. Hsu, Kevin B. Moore, Sarah Reber, Alice Henriques Volz, and Richard A. Windle, 2020. Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2016 to 2019: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances. Federal Reserve Bulletin 106(5): 1–42.) (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.)\\n\\n\\nWhen does direct indexing add value?\\nTLH alpha differential (direct indexing versus index fund) by return environment\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on Qontigo U.S. equity risk models (US4); and Vanguard calculations, based on Federal Reserve Bulletin data (Neil Bhutta, Jesse Bricker, Andrew C. Chang, Lisa J. Dettling, Sarena Goodman, Joanne W. Hsu, Kevin B. Moore, Sarah Reber, Alice Henriques Volz, and Richard A. Windle, 2020.

(Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.)\\nNote: The results are for hypothetical investor profiles, are for illustrative purposes only, and are not a guarantee. TLH benefit (alpha) differential indicates the difference in the annualized TLH benefit between direct indexing (higher benefit) and index-fund harvesting scenarios.\\n\\nWhile the potential benefit of TLH depends on the investor's tax profile and level of income they can offset, the research revealed that for ultra-high-net-worth investors with sufficient income to offset capital gains up to $3,000 of ordinary income in a tax year, direct indexing can add significant value (~100 bps, over the time period analyzed).\\nWhen it comes to TLH, remember that one size does not fit all. By understanding your clients' complete financial pictures, you can help them determine if TLH is appropriate for them. If it is, you can develop a TLH strategy best suited for them, without introducing uncompensated risks into their portfolios.\\nLooking to operationalize TLH and other tax-planning strategies?

The index provider's assessment of a company, based on the company's level of involvement in a particular industry or the index provider's own ESG criteria, may differ from that of other funds or of the advisor's or an investor's assessment of such company. As a result, the companies deemed eligible by the index provider may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics. The evaluation of companies for ESG screening or integration is dependent on the timely and accurate reporting of ESG data by the companies. Successful application of the screens will depend on the index provider's proper identification and analysis of ESG data.\"},\n",

ETFs have been widely adopted by investors for a number of reasons—including low costs, broad diversification, low tracking error, and easy accessibility. Another essential feature for many ETF investors is tax efficiency.\\nA few key factors contribute to that tax efficiency. First, many ETFs track market-capitalization-weighted indexes. Effective tracking of such indexes typically can be achieved with minimal portfolio turnover—especially for equity indexes—and low-turnover strategies are inherently tax-efficient.\\nFurthermore, tax efficiency is built into the ETF ecosystem. Because ETFs trade on exchanges much like the way individual stocks do, the vast majority of trading in ETFs takes place between investors on the secondary market, with no impact on the ETFs\\' underlying securities.\\nA much smaller share of ETF trading occurs on the primary market, where ETFs create or redeem shares through transactions with financial institutions known as authorized participants. For most primary market transactions, ETF shares are exchanged for a basket of securities rather than cash. Such \"in-kind\" transactions are not considered taxable events and thus also contribute to ETFs\\' tax efficiency.\\nDraft legislation recently unveiled in the Senate proposes changes to the tax treatment of in-kind transactions. Vanguard opposes these changes and believes that the current tax treatment of in-kind transactions is in investors\\' best interest. We continuously work with policymakers to advocate for policies that give investors the best chance for investment success.\\nETFs are tax-efficient but not tax-free\\nInvestors should keep in mind that, although ETFs are highly tax-efficient, they may occasionally distribute capital gains. The primary goal of index-based ETFs is to track the target index as closely as possible. Maintaining tax efficiency is another important goal for Vanguard\\'s portfolio managers, but that\\'s ultimately one of multiple secondary objectives—which include managing transaction costs and adding benchmark-relative value—that Vanguard balances in the best interest of our diverse shareholder base.\\nAlthough the ETF creation/redemption process described earlier improves tax efficiency, realized capital gains distributions remain possible. Redeeming ETF shares in kind can minimize the ETFs\\' need to sell securities at a taxable gain, thereby reducing the need for realized gains to be distributed to ETF shareholders. But this process does not eliminate capital gains for shareholders, who will generally realize a taxable gain or a loss when they sell their ETF shares. Furthermore, ETFs may engage in taxable transactions to buy and sell securities, such as when a target index is rebalanced and certain securities are added to or removed from it.\\nAlthough several factors can contribute to ETFs\\' realization of capital gains, perhaps the most important is the consistent appreciation of an ETF\\'s holdings over an extended period. Global equities have generally enjoyed significant gains, with only brief interruptions, for more than a decade. As a result, many ETFs hold securities with unrealized capital gains that can become realized through the normal course of portfolio operations.\\nWhat investors should know\\nFor most investors, ETF capital gains distributions are simply a marginal reduction in the control that investors have over timing the realization of gains. Capital gains distributions by an ETF bring forward the payment of taxes that would otherwise be embedded in the ETF\\'s net asset value and therefore might be realized when the shares are eventually sold. Put another way, when an ETF distributes capital gains to its shareholders, taxes are paid on those gains now rather than at a future time when an investor sells the ETF shares at a gain.\\nKeep in mind that capital gains distributions generally have no impact on an ETF\\'s performance. Once the capital gains are distributed, the price of the ETF is generally reduced by the amount of the distribution. Note, too, that investors in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and retirement plans are generally unaffected by capital gains distributions.\\nA commitment to transparency\\nVanguard provides transparent and timely estimates of capital gains for all our mutual funds and ETFs. Estimated realized and unrealized gains for Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs are published and updated monthly on our website, and clients can expect to see an estimate of annual gains distributions published on the website each year in late November.\\nNotes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs, obtain a prospectus (or summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-997-2798 to request one. Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other important information are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing.\\nVanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'My first childhood memory is of sitting in the back of a station wagon with my brother. My mother was at the wheel, and we were in a long line waiting for gasoline. It might have been 1974; I learned, at some point, that an embargo by oil-producing nations had created shortages that led to even-and-odd-day rationing. The last number on our license plate was 8, so we could buy gasoline only on an even-numbered date.\\nI\\'ve thought about this recently because shortages of various goods and services, coupled with inflation like we\\'ve not seen in ages, have some observers wondering: Are we about to revisit the 1970s? I understand the concerns. Rapidly rising inflation eviscerated the economy then. The unemployment rate rose dramatically. It was a terrible environment for investors for two or three years.\\nI can tell you that, no, we\\'re not about to enter a period of stagflation—stagnant economic activity amid high unemployment and inflation—like the 1970s. We continue to anticipate economic growth and, unlike in the 1970s, demand for workers is high. Among several challenges, the most significant factor holding back the economy now is a lack of workers.\\nFigure 1. Supply, labor shortages act as a drag on growth\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, using data through September 30, 2021, from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nThe brown bars in Figure 1 represent economic output lost because of a shortage in the supply of goods—kitchen cabinets or whatever you want to buy—losses that have intensified since the pandemic started early in 2020. If you\\'re looking to buy a new or used car or trying to complete a home repair, you\\'ve likely experienced supply shortages firsthand. If you\\'ve been successful in your efforts, you may have paid more than you expected. Such supply tightness shouldn\\'t come as a surprise; for many workers, although their lives were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, their paychecks weren\\'t. Online demand grew incredibly strong at the same time production was disrupted globally.\\nNow, though, the shortage of workers, represented by the bluish-green bars in Figure 1, is starting to influence our forecasts more significantly. Although we still anticipate significant growth, we\\'ve lately downgraded growth forecasts for many countries and regions, and it\\'s not because demand is weak.\\nFigure 2. A crackdown on debt in China adds to growth pressures\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, using data from the People’s Bank of China and the U.S. Federal Reserve through 2019.\\n\\nAt the same time, China is working to mitigate leverage in the financial system, specifically in the property market. China is intentionally and permanently changing its business model, and I think the market underestimates this. China is no longer focused solely on driving real estate expansion and leverage to become a middle-income economy. When it fixates on a problem, it doesn\\'t let go, and now China is repivoting its growth model again.\\nReal estate has accounted for roughly 30% of China\\'s growth. In the United States, it accounted for, at most, from 10% to 15% before the global financial crisis. So there\\'s a concerted slowdown in China, although nothing alarming in the sense that we\\'d see a hard landing. But it\\'s coming at the same time that we\\'re seeing constraints on U.S. and European economies that want to run faster but can\\'t because of a lack of availability of goods and services.\\nFigure 3. Job openings per unemployed worker are at an all-time high\\nSource: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 30, 2021, through the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED database.\\n\\nSo how does this play out? We have growth slowing in the United States and China. We have oil prices shooting higher again. Is it going to be like 1974? The answer is clearly no. The one big difference—and it\\'s a material difference—between the environment in 1974 and the environment today is that demand for workers now is extremely high, as Figure 3 shows.\\nThe reason we have supply and labor shortages is because incomes have been growing, policy support from the federal government has been as large as it was in World War II, and now we have the economy coming back online. We\\'ve underestimated supply chain disruptions but demand wants to go further still. It\\'s why we\\'ll see higher inflation, but not a stagflationary environment.\\nFigure 4. Labor market red-hot in \"non-COVID\" sectors\\nSource: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 30, 2021, through the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED database.\\n\\nFigure 4 breaks down the number of openings per unemployed worker in three sectors—information technology; financial services; and professional services, such as law firms—that were not engaged in the face-to-face activities so disrupted by the pandemic. The ratio of job openings to unemployed or marginally employed workers in professional services? Two to one. I added the lighter-shaded bars to show the last time the labor market was ever this tight, and we\\'ve surpassed that.\\nThere is a genuine significant pressure on demand and we will continue to see it. Among the reasons these conditions have become so acute so quickly is that a number of workers have stopped looking for work. Part of this pressure will be relieved. Wages are starting to go up, which will draw workers back, and this is very positive news given some of the profound shocks that had hit the global economy. But this introduces different risks to the forecast. The risk in the next six months is growth that\\'s perhaps a little bit weaker than expected in the United States and some weakness in China with its real estate clampdown.\\nBut the darker-shaded bars in Figure 4 aren\\'t coming down very quickly, which means we have a shift in risk in the next 12 months. If in the near term there\\'s a modest downside risk to the markets, if they\\'re vulnerable to a downside risk to growth, the further-out risk is when the supply chain disruptions start to moderate. When all those cargo containers off the port of Los Angeles can finally be offloaded, we\\'ll have another issue: The Federal Reserve will need to normalize policy.\\nFigure 5. Monetary policy remains historically accommodative\\nNotes: Vanguard\\'s proprietary monetary policy measurement examines the effect of the policy rate, central bank asset purchases, and inflation relative to the neutral rate of interest to gauge how \"tight\" or \"loose\" policy is.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Laubach and Williams (2003), and Wu-Xia (2016). Accessed via Moody’s Data Buffet as of September 30, 2021.\\n\\nFigure 5 reflects Vanguard\\'s assessment of whether monetary policy is stimulative or tight. The higher the line, the tighter the conditions, which you tend to see if inflation is out of control and the labor market is already at full employment. The shaded areas represent recessions. The COVID-19 recession was deep, but it was so short that it barely registers on the chart. You can see how stimulative that monetary policy was—appropriately so—during the recovery from the global financial crisis. But monetary policy is more stimulative today than it was during the global financial crisis, and this isn\\'t a debt-deleveraging recovery. This chart doesn\\'t reflect fiscal policy, but if it did, we\\'d need another floor.\\nPolicymakers have been extremely successful in arresting a horrible shock. It\\'s a reason many companies didn\\'t go under. In one sense it was a heroic effort. But the critic in me says: Be careful of fighting the last war. If we wait too long to normalize, we\\'re going to have another issue on our hands, the potential for strong wage growth to fuel more persistent inflation. If we get past the supply chain issues, which I think we will, the Fed will have to be adept. It should not raise interest rates now in the face of a profound supply shock. But when those conditions are ameliorated, the Fed will need to have the conviction to raise rates in an environment where the inflation rate may be coming down and the labor market continues to tighten.\\nThe time of 0% interest rates should soon come to an end. That will help keep the growing risks of more permanent inflation at bay.\\n\\xa0\\nI’d like to thank Vanguard Americas chief economist Roger Aliaga-Díaz, Ph.D., and the Vanguard global economics team for their invaluable contributions to this commentary.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Recessions can sorely test consumers. Unemployment rates generally rise and financial conditions deteriorate, leaving many less able to pay their bills and weakening their balance sheets.\\xa0\\nThe latest recession sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, though, was different. It led to an unprecedented spike in layoffs, but the finances of consumers actually improved as they spent less and—thanks in part to government stimulus relief—saved more.\\n\"Another differentiator this time around is how broad the consumer recovery has been,\" said Vanguard Principal and Co-Head of Structured Products Bob Behal. \"Our research shows that consumer credit profiles have improved in all income brackets, and the magnitude has been fairly large.\"\\nIn fact, consumers have accumulated \"excess\" savings of around $2.6 trillion—savings on top of what they would typically have had on hand—and that bodes well for the economy. If they open their wallets and spend more, they could fuel faster economic growth. And even if consumers remain cautious, they should be able to provide some cushion for the economy when activity inevitably slows.\\nCredit metrics tell the story\\n\"We looked at historical debt burdens, loan performance, and savings rates to develop a real-time picture of consumers\\' financial condition,\" said Mr. Behal. \"Unlike in past recessions when job losses caused households to draw from their savings, the opposite happened.\" Figure 1 shows the personal savings rate in the U.S. as a percentage of disposable income since 2000. While it was well below 10% during much of that period, it recently climbed to multiyear highs. Peaks in 2020 and 2021 roughly coincide with payments of government stimulus checks.\\nThe same figure shows the financial obligation ratio, a broad-based measure of the ratio of household debt payments to total disposable income. (Debt payments include estimates for revolving and installment debt, mortgage and rent payments, auto lease payments, homeowners\\' insurance, and property tax payments.) It has declined from levels above 16% throughout the 2000s and is currently sitting at a 20-year low of about 13%.\\nFigure 1: U.S. consumers have been saving more and avoiding debt\\nNotes: Data are from January 2000 through June 2021. The personal savings rate is a three-month rolling average.Source: Vanguard calculations using data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\\n\\nThese positive trends can be explained in large part by low interest rates, government stimulus, wage growth, and more stringent lending requirements. Consumer behavior may also be a contributing factor as households have shown some reluctance to take on debt since the global financial crisis.\\nOther metrics we track to gauge the health of the consumer include the unemployment rate and the rate at which credit card companies write off bad debt. Figure 2 shows that while the unemployment rate climbed to over 14% as large swaths of the economy were shuttered, the rate of bad loan charge-offs during the pandemic actually declined.\\nThat stands in sharp contrast to the more typical pattern during recessions, including the global financial crisis, when charge-offs tracked the rise in unemployment. In this recession, generous unemployment benefits and stimulus checks likely helped.\\nFigure 2: Credit card write-offs trended lower even as unemployment spiked during the pandemic\\nNote: Data are from January 2000 through July 2021.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations based on data from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nConsumers across the income spectrum are faring well\\nOne way we have attempted to quantify the breadth of the positive trajectory of consumer finances is by evaluating cash balances stratified by income. To do that, we used a measure tracked by the Federal Reserve, which is the sum of checkable deposits and currency, time deposits and short-term investments, and money market fund shares. This data series is a good proxy for the change in consumer savings, although it does not capture data for people outside the banking system.\\nFigure 3 shows that the change in cash equivalents has been increasing even during the pandemic for all three income cohorts. That stands in sharp contrast to the previous recession in 2007–2009, when we saw the more typical pattern—savings increased among higher-income earners but decreased among lower-income earners. The nature of the latest crisis, government stimulus payments and supplementary unemployment benefits, and the stability of other assets such as real estate and financial assets, appear to have left the consumer in better financial shape than expected at this point in the cycle.\\n\"While it\\'s good to see the credit profiles of higher-income cohorts improving,\" said Mr. Behal, \"the fact that lower-income cohorts are on the same trajectory is more unusual and could support a broader and longer-lasting economic upswing.\"\\nFigure 3: Consumers at all income levels are adding to their savings\\nNotes: Data are for the first quarter of 2000 through the first quarter of 2021 and show the trend in year-over-year change in cash equivalents. “Low income” represents the 1st to 40th percentiles of income earners, “medium income” represents the 41st to 80th percentiles, and “high income” represents the 81st to 100th percentiles according to U.S. Federal Reserve income data.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations based on data from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\\n\\nThe additional capacity, ability, and willingness of consumers at all income levels to keep current on their payments given the rise in savings levels may be translating to better credit performance. Figure 4 shows the percentage of all auto loans in the public securitized asset-backed securities market with payments that are at least 30 days overdue. The data is segmented by FICO credit score bands to quantify trends by consumer risk levels. Higher FICO scores signal less risk of default and increased capacity to pay. Lower scores would be expected to correspond to higher delinquency rates.\\nSeveral interesting findings can be gleaned from this data. In the initial stages of the pandemic, lenders offered loan payment relief that seems to have reduced delinquencies in all three risk cohorts. As each round of stimulus was distributed, delinquencies declined further. Finally, the highest-quality cohort, loans with a FICO score of 670 or more, performed in line with historic expectations. That\\'s important because it represents the cohort with the largest amount of outstanding loans and therefore provides further support that overall the U.S. consumer is in good financial health.\\nMarked drops in auto loan delinquencies coincide with the stimulus payments that were made, and subsequent increases appear as that effect wears off and the situation normalizes. It is encouraging that we\\'re not seeing a complete reversal, however, and delinquencies are still well below historical averages.\\nFigure 4: Past-due auto loans by FICO score are well below their historical average\\nNotes: \"Past due\" is defined as at least 30 days overdue.

This trend could lead to expansion of credit if banks, as well as auto and other consumer lenders, broaden credit risk criteria to extend loans to lower-quality borrowers.\\nAsset-backed securitizations should do well because their structural protections are designed for recessions and current loan performance is well below these stresses. \"Our positioning in various credit funds reflects these views,\" said Mr. Behal. \"We have been generally overweight asset-backed securities and the U.S. financial services, consumer, and media/communications sectors. In addition, we have selective positions in sectors and companies that were hardest-hit by the pandemic and have benefited from the economy reopening.\"\\nPent-up demand for travel, hospitality, and leisure activities or even a reversion to the norm would suggest that consumers are going to spend more, and they have a lot of savings to do just that. On the other hand, the trend we\\'ve seen since the global financial crisis of consumers saving more and shying away from taking on debt could prevail.\\nWhile there are some signs indicating which way the situation might go—air travel has picked up and revolving loan balances have been increasing—it\\'s probably too early to call whether consumers are going to unleash a spending spree that would boost economic activity or keep more in reserve to fall back on in tougher times.\\nOther variables such as the Delta variant may also factor into the pace of normalization, but overall it does appear the consumer is better positioned going forward.\\nActive Fixed Income at Vanguard\\n* Includes funds advised by Wellington Management Company LLP.\\nNote: Data are as of June 30, 2021.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Markets weren\\'t too surprised to see a run-up in inflation in much of the world in 2021, aware that prices in a reopening economy would be compared with the low year-earlier prices that prevailed during COVID-19 lockdowns. But readings have been hotter than forecast as supply in a range of goods and even in labor has failed to keep up with resurgent demand.\\nWith accommodative monetary and fiscal policies expected to remain in place for some time, could inflation at rates we\\'ve seen in 2021 persist in 2022 and beyond?\\nIt\\'s not our base case. Our proprietary inflation forecast model, described in the recently published Vanguard research paper The inflation machine: How it works and where it\\'s going, tells us that the U.S. core Consumer Price Index (CPI) will likely cool from recent readings above 4% toward the U.S. Federal Reserve\\'s 2% average inflation target by mid-2022. Our model then foresees a further uptick toward the end of 2022, assuming fiscal stimulus of about $500 billion is enacted this year.\\n\"Fiscal stimulus, though, is a wild card,\" said Asawari Sathe, a Vanguard U.S. economist and the paper\\'s lead author. \"If we see $1 trillion or more in additional, unfunded fiscal spending enacted this year, core inflation could pick up more sustainably toward the end of 2022 or in 2023. This risk of persistently higher inflation is not fully anticipated by either the financial markets or the Federal Reserve forecasts and could lead the Fed to start raising short-term rates sooner than its present timetable of 2023.\"\\nWhat\\'s been driving U.S. inflation higher\\nOur research Vanguard economic and market outlook for 2021: Approaching the dawn envisioned a possible \"inflation scare\" as spare capacity was used up and recovery from the pandemic continued. Ensuing supply constraints affected a wide range of goods, however, contributing to a greater-than-expected surge in inflation. (The surge in 2021 is reflected in the first panel of Figure 1 below.)\\nNevertheless, most economists (including ours) believe that recent inflation readings that have more than doubled the Fed\\'s 2% target will prove transitory as supply issues are resolved and year-earlier numbers fade out of comparisons.\\nThe second panel of Figure 1, which shows key inflation drivers pointing in different directions, supports that view. Although solid economic growth and accommodative Fed and government fiscal policies would argue for inflation staying persistently high, significant labor market slack and stable measures of inflation expectations—what businesses and consumers expect to pay in the future—suggest that price increases may ease.\\nFigure 1. The key drivers of U.S. inflation are sending mixed signals\\nNote: Data cover the 50 years ended June 1, 2021.\\nSources: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Federal Reserve, using information from Refinitiv.\\n\\nThe challenges in forecasting inflation\\nInflation forecasting is a complex endeavor that must consider broad inputs whose relative importance can vary over time. They include:\\n\\nCyclical factors such as growth and labor market slack.\\nSecular forces such as technology and globalization, which tend to keep costs—and, by extension, prices—from rising.\\nFiscal and monetary policy.\\n\\nWith significant further stimulus being considered in Washington, fiscal policy is a particularly important factor right now in forecasting inflation.\\nOur model\\'s outlook for inflation: Higher than before the pandemic, but not runaway\\nWe used our model to identify the potential impact of rising fiscal spending on inflation through the end of 2022. For that purpose, we have assumed that both the policy decisions and inflation expectation “shocks” originate in the third quarter of 2021.\\n\"The output of all the scenarios we looked at suggest that risks are toward core inflation running higher than its pre-pandemic level of 2%, but that runaway inflation is not in the cards,\" said Maximilian Wieland, a Vanguard investment strategist and co-author of the research paper.\\nIn our baseline scenario, shown in Figure 2, we assume an additional $500 billion in fiscal stimulus and an increase of 20 basis points (bps) in inflation expectations. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) Our model suggests that would push core CPI to a year-over-year rate of 2.9% by the end of 2021. Continued stimulus and moderately greater inflation expectations would further push inflation—offset by stronger base effects (year-over-year comparisons with higher 2021 prices)—to 2.6% by year-end 2022.\\nIn our downside scenario, we envision no additional stimulus and a minimal rise in inflation expectations; in our upside scenario, we bump up our estimate for additional fiscal stimulus to about $1.5 trillion and for inflation expectations by 25 bps; and our \"Go Big\" scenario factors in substantial net additional fiscal stimulus (about $3 trillion spent over a year) and a marked jump (about 50 bps) in inflation expectations.\\nIn all our scenarios, the second and third quarters of 2022 suggest some weakness from baseline effects. But none of the scenarios results in the kind of runaway, 1970s-style inflation that some fear.\\nFigure 2. Scenarios for inflation based on potential fiscal stimulus\\n* The Fed’s 2% average inflation target is based on the core U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, which considers a more comprehensive array of goods and services than CPI does and can reweight expenditures as people substitute some goods and services for others.\\nNotes: The scenario data for the core CPI are Vanguard’s inflation machine model estimates for alternative fiscal stimulus spending. The downside scenario factors in $1.9 trillion in enacted fiscal stimulus and anticipates a 5 bps increase in the break-even inflation rate. The baseline scenario factors in $1.9 trillion in enacted fiscal stimulus and anticipates $500 billion in additional fiscal stimulus and a 20 bps increase in break-even inflation. The upside scenario factors in $1.9 trillion in enacted fiscal stimulus and anticipates $1.5 trillion in additional fiscal stimulus and a 25 bps increase in break-even inflation. The “Go Big” scenario factors in $1.9 trillion in enacted fiscal stimulus and anticipates $3 trillion in additional fiscal stimulus, a 50 bps increase in break-even inflation, and growth upside. All scenarios assume no change in the Fed’s monetary policy through 2022. We use the correlation between break-even inflation and long-term inflation expectations to adjust impacts in the model.\\nSources: Estimates as of September 1, 2021, using data from Thomson Reuters Datastream, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, and Moody’s Data Buffet, based on Vanguard’s inflation machine model.\\n\\nKey takeaways for investors\\nAlthough persistently higher inflation is not our base case, our model suggests that the consensus is too sanguine about inflation settling into its pre-pandemic trend of 2% in 2022.\\nIf inflation readings continue to come in higher than expected, it could lead the Fed to move up its schedule for raising short-term interest rates. That might be good news for investors, as today\\'s low rates constrain longer-term portfolio returns.\\nIncreased uncertainty about inflation highlights the importance of building a globally diversified portfolio, which gives investors exposure to regions with differing inflation environments.'},\n",

The first such mutual funds go back decades, and Vanguard\\'s first ESG fund, Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund, was launched in 2000. What is new is the rapid recent growth in the array of ESG strategies and product offerings.\\nIn the year ended June 30, 2021, U.S. ESG assets under management grew 79%, to $313 billion, with index-based products taking in 67% of net cash flows. The number of products available surged the same year by 23%, to 454, across mutual funds and ETFs.\\nESG assets in U.S. mutual funds and ETFs\\nNote: Figures show the number of ESG-focused mutual funds and ETFs in the U.S. market and their aggregate assets under management as of June 30 each year since 2017. Source: Morningstar, Inc., as of June 30, 2021.\\n\\nSome investors have wondered why Vanguard\\'s ESG product lineup hasn\\'t grown at the same pace as the industry\\'s. While our ESG assets under management (AUM) have grown significantly during this time, we\\'ve introduced only one new ESG product for U.S. investors, Vanguard ESG U.S. Corporate Bond ETF, since the beginning of 2020.\\nBut the small number of new Vanguard products shouldn\\'t be interpreted as a statement on ESG investing. Our methodical approach to ESG product development has primarily to do with our ownership structure and core purpose. The ESG U.S. Corporate Bond ETF launch followed a multiyear research process that predated the recent surge.\\nTo be sure, all companies seek to do right by their owners—whether they are public shareholders or private shareholders. Vanguard is owned by our U.S. funds, which are owned by their investors. To do right by our owners, we strive to stand for all investors and give them the best chance for investment success. Therefore, one of our greatest responsibilities is the development of the products we put in the marketplace. Because of that, all product research follows a time-tested set of product design principles.\\nWhat are Vanguard\\'s product design principles?\\nOur product design approach rests on four essential questions:\\n\\nDoes the proposed product have enduring investment merit? We must have conviction a product is capitalizing on an investment thesis that has the potential to thrive for decades to come.\\nDoes it fulfill the long-term needs of its targeted clients? Because our investors are our owners, the product must contribute to their success as part of a well-diversified portfolio.\\nCan we deliver a compelling advantage over competitors? We assess how a Vanguard product can stand out in the marketplace. We look at factors such as in-house investment management capabilities across our indexing and active fixed income teams and our ability to secure the best external active equity managers at an advantageous price.\\nIs it feasible to launch the product? Finally, we assess all potential legal, regulatory, and operational constraints to ensure that the product is viable.\\n\\nA rigorous process guides every product launch\\n\\nProduct ideas are winnowed in a multitier approval process. It begins with our Portfolio Review Department, which is responsible for all aspects of product research, strategy, management, and manager search and oversight. Product proposals then go through due diligence review by our Global Investment Committee, led by Vanguard\\'s CEO. Ultimately, all approved product proposals move to our board of directors, which makes the final decision whether to proceed with a launch.\\nHow ESG figures into product design\\nAn ESG focus brings additional considerations into the product design process, focusing on how best to measure a strategy\\'s progress toward its objectives. Some ESG strategies place high priority on avoiding certain sectors or businesses while others actively seek to drive specified social outcomes or sustainability. ESG strategies may also hinge on whether companies are governed by a diverse board and demonstrate strong stewardship.\\n\"When considering new ESG products, we assess factors such as variations in index providers\\' methodologies or active managers\\' approaches, and general investor motivations and expectations,\" says Sarah Hersh, senior ESG product manager in the Portfolio Review Department. \"We also ask whether the product would be broadly diversified and how it may perform on investment and ESG outcomes, relative to an unconstrained parent index.\"\\nAs of today, Vanguard\\'s ESG lineup for U.S. investors consists of five products:\\n\\nFour are exclusionary index products, three equity and one fixed income, which are broadly diversified and seek to track benchmark indexes that are reasonably constructed and have transparent definitions of the sectors or business practices they seek to exclude.\\n\\nVanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV)\\nVanguard ESG International Stock ETF (VSGX)\\nVanguard FTSE Social Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFTAX)\\nVanguard ESG U.S. Corporate Bond ETF (VCEB)\\n\\n\\nThe fifth, Vanguard Global ESG Select Stock Fund (VESGX), is an active inclusionary product managed by Wellington Management Company LLP. The advisor seeks to identify companies that, among other characteristics, demonstrate ESG leadership and the potential for higher-than-average returns on equity.\\n\\n\"Our exclusionary products give investors a range of options for avoiding exposure to certain ESG risks or expressing their values,\" Ms. Hersh says. \"Our active product enables investors to access companies with a strong return on capital and leading stewardship practices, a combination the advisor expects to deliver alpha over the long term.\"\\nWhat\\'s next?\\nThe U.S. mutual fund and ETF industry is evolving to include a wider range of approaches. For example, impact investing is an active approach that explicitly seeks to generate positive total return and a real measurable social or environmental outcome. Thematic investing can use active or passive strategies to target companies with mandates such as encouraging energy transformation or addressing climate change. Inclusionary index products are often based on an ESG ratings provider\\'s assessment of company management of ESG issues.\\n\"ESG strategies are a significant focus area in our current research efforts,\" says Ms. Hersh. \"We have confidence in the merit of ESG investing broadly, and the thoroughness of our research process reflects our commitment to deliver enduring, compelling products to our clients.\"\\nWhile ESG investing is continually evolving, Vanguard\\'s commitment to our product design principles remains constant. We believe those principles will help ensure that any product we offer will benefit our investors—our owners.Notes: \\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs, obtain a prospectus (or summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-997-2798 to request one.

       "  'content': 'Crossover bonds are often seen as an attractive risk bucket on the credit-rating continuum. They tend to have lower credit risk than the broad high-yield market while providing more yield than higher-rated investment-grade bonds. As Figure 1 shows, over the long term they have produced attractive risk-adjusted returns—a measure of the return earned for the amount of risk taken. From April 2006 through August 2021, the average annualized risk-adjusted return for crossovers was 2.2%, compared with 2.0% for high yield and 1.2% for BBBs, based on data from Bloomberg.\\nFigure 1: Over time, crossovers tend to generate higher risk-adjusted returns than BBBs or high-yield\\nNotes: Data are two-year averages from April 2006 through August 2021.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from Bloomberg.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns.\\n\\nDuring times of economic stress, fallen angels are more prevalent. They typically underperform the debt of companies that get downgraded but remain within the investment-grade universe, in part because the buyer bases for investment-grade and high-yield bonds differ.\\nPrices rise more for rising stars\\nAnd when the economy is in a recovery phase, ratings upgrades tend to be more numerous, leading to a higher proportion of BB bonds migrating to investment grade. These rising stars typically see their spreads tighten and prices rise more than would be the case for an upgrade within the high-yield universe, in part because of their different buyer bases.\\n\"The price dislocations that occur with bonds crossing the dividing line between investment grade and high yield present opportunities for active bond managers,\" said Michael Chang, a U.S.-based Vanguard senior portfolio manager. \"Vanguard has a large, seasoned team of corporate credit analysts who work collaboratively across geographic regions to assess issuers\" credit profiles and, more importantly for our clients in this segment, where they may be headed.\"\\nEconomic downturns: Each time is different\\nThe recession we are just coming out of created a more challenging environment in some ways for crossovers than previous downturns did. It arrived after a decades-long run-up in the size of the corporate debt market. Figure 2 shows that growth was particularly strong in BBB debt in the decade after the global financial crisis, in part because of low interest rates and companies taking on debt.\\n\"Investors were concerned and cautious regarding the growth in outstanding BBB debt pre-COVID,\" said Michael Pollitt, a U.K.-based Vanguard senior credit analyst. \"Given where we were in the credit cycle, there were fears that an economic slowdown would trigger a wave of downgrades to high yield that the junk bond market might not be able to absorb easily and forced selling by institutions and index funds with investment-grade-only mandates.\"\\nFigure 2: Outstanding BBB debt has grown even faster than investment-grade debt overall\\nNote: Data cover outstanding debt from August 31, 2011, through September 8, 2021, and show the total outstanding debt for investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds and pan-European corporate bonds.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from Bloomberg.\\n\\nDowngrades for large issuers offered opportunity\\nThose fears proved overblown. The onset of the pandemic initially produced fallen angels at an unprecedented pace. During the first seven months of 2020, the S&P Global Ratings credit-rating agency downgraded 40 issuers of a collective $340 billion in debt to junk status globally, including big companies such as Occidental Petroleum, Kraft Heinz, Carnival, Delta Air Lines, Renault, and Ford. However, the major dislocation anticipated by the markets pre-pandemic didn\\'t materialize.\\nThis recession was also unusual in being largely caused by efforts to rein in a health crisis, not by more typical culprits such as an overheating economy, a bursting asset bubble, or an unexpected external shock. Sectors that are more sensitive to travel restrictions and other social-distancing measures—such as transportation, leisure, hospitality, and retail—were hit much harder than in other downturns and produced a larger proportion of fallen angels.\\nIn other ways, however, the latest recession has played out better than might have been expected. Unlike during the global financial crisis, many governments and central banks provided swift and unprecedented support to help lessen the pandemic\\'s blow by injecting liquidity into some of the most affected sectors. In the United States, for example, Congress provided three rounds of grants and loans totaling nearly $80 billion to airlines; regulators showed flexibility in airport slot usage and lease payments on toll roads; and the Federal Reserve made investment-grade bonds eligible for its asset-purchase program and set up several corporate credit facilities to provide a financing backstop that helped stabilize the market and support a swift recovery in bond spreads.\\nHolding onto some fallen angels\\nCredit-rating agencies responded positively to these developments and to a surprisingly fast recovery in corporate earnings overall. We have seen multiple positive rating actions this year from rating agencies. The fallen angel ArcelorMittal, for example, recently completed a round trip back to investment grade in just a little over a year.\\n\"In this environment, we were able to add significant value with crossovers,\" said Min Fang, a U.S.-based Vanguard credit analyst. \"We held on to some fallen angels that were fundamentally solid, which limited the potential loss from fire sales and resulted in outsized returns when those companies began to recover. We also provided liquidity to some corporations that were expected to recover over time—including airlines, cruise lines, and hotels—by purchasing new debt issued during the pandemic at very attractive levels.\"\\nWhere crossover opportunities stand now\\nHistorically, the ideal time to invest in fallen angels has been immediately after a downgrade to high yield. That\\'s because often most of the bad news has typically been priced in by the time of the downgrade. Since another wave of downgrades is unlikely at this point in the credit cycle, active managers still have the opportunity to try to add value by identifying potential rising stars well ahead of their being upgraded to investment-grade.\\nBy sector, prospects too have shifted. For industries and companies that were facing long-term decline before the pandemic, business conditions could deteriorate further. For example, nonessential brick-and-mortar retailers are likely to face more difficulties as online shopping has accelerated in popularity during the pandemic. As a result, some fallen angels in those industries may remain in high-yield territory.\\nOn the other hand, although some hard-hit industries such as airlines, hospitality, and leisure may see some structural damage to long-term demand for business travel, new demand spurred by global economic growth could provide some offsets. Fallen angels in these industries should recover over time to pre-COVID levels, enabling them to migrate back to investment grade.\\nNew trends in a post-COVID world\\nAnd industries that are well-positioned to benefit from new trends emerging in the post-COVID world—including digitization, remote working, and supply-chain reconfiguration—may also see benefits to profitability and thus potentially more rising stars.\\n\"The opportunity set within the crossover universe has narrowed as the global economy recovers from the recession, and the spreads of risk assets have meaningfully tightened over the past 12 months,\" said Bradley Marr, a U.S.-based Vanguard senior high-yield credit analyst.\\n\"We still have a number of avenues at our disposal, though, to add value: by avoiding fallen angels, as they can experience severe price declines; by taking advantage of market inefficiencies, whereby investing in these fallen angels has proven to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns; and by identifying rising stars, to take advantage of their potential for price appreciation in the event of an upgrade to investment grade.\"'},\n",

Premiums they must pay seem to be ever-escalating; the coronavirus pandemic has heightened health concerns. Such concern can be particularly acute for individuals who do not yet meet the age 65 minimum for Medicare eligibility.\\nHealth Savings Accounts (HSAs) provide a hedge against some of that uncertainty by providing a tax-sheltered, tax-deductible savings and investment vehicle. While the main purpose of HSAs is to defray health care costs, their flexibility also makes them a versatile and powerful tool for building wealth.\\nYou and your clients can learn more about HSAs; how to use them optimally; and important, recently enacted changes from a research paper in Vanguard's Financial Planning Perspectives series—HSAs: An-off-label prescription for retirement planning.\\nThe HSA basics\\n\\nWhat are they? HSAs are tax-sheltered savings accounts available only to those enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). An HSA provides tax benefits intended to defray the higher deductibles and out-of-pocket maximum costs of an HDHP.\\nWhy use them? In tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k) plans, you can pay taxes up front or defer them—either way, taxes will eventually come due. With an HSA, you are able to never pay tax—contributions and earnings are tax free. The tax savings can compound to produce higher returns than those available from other accounts.\\nHow to use them? How best to use an HSA depends on how much clients can afford to save. If they have enough savings ability, it’s best for them to treat their HSA as a long-term investment. In other words, they should pay for current medical expenses out of pocket. The more limited their ability to save, the more complex the decision.\\n\\nIt's difficult to overstate how powerfully an HSA can augment an individual's saving power, through the combined effects of tax-free contributions and compounding when invested.\\nWhile the funds are earmarked for qualified health-related expenses, in practice they can be used at any time for any purpose—provided the account owner has receipts for qualified health expenses that offset the withdrawal amount. Any individual health expense can only be claimed once. Therefore, accurate and organized recordkeeping is paramount. Note that withdrawals without offsetting, qualified expenses are subject to ordinary income tax and a 20% federal penalty tax for those under 65.\\nSo theoretically, a client could withdraw HSA money—tax-free—to pay for a semester of a child's college tuition; or for emergency house repairs. The only requirement would be to have enough documented, qualified, health-related expenses to offset the distribution amount.\\nOver the years individuals move, throw things away, and inevitably lose track of items they don’t use on a daily basis—such as deductible receipts. As an advisor, you can add significant value by helping clients to digitize and securely archive eligible health-related receipts (along with other important financial information).Taxes now, taxes later, or with an HSA, maybe never\\n\\n\\n\\nSavings account\\nContributions\\nInvestment growth\\nWithdrawals\\n\\n\\nHealth savings account\\nPre-tax\\nTax-deferred\\nTax-exempt*\\n\\n\\nRoth IRA or employer plan\\nTaxable\\nTax-deferred\\nTax-exempt\\n\\n\\nTraditional IRA or employer plan\\nPre-tax\\nTax-deferred\\nTaxable\\n\\n\\n529 plan\\nTaxable\\nTax-deferred\\nTax-exempt*\\n\\n\\nTaxable investment accounts\\nTaxable\\nTaxable\\nTaxable gains\\n\\n\\n\\n*Distributions must be offset by qualified expenses.\\nNotes: When taking withdrawals from a tax-deferred retirement\\xa0plan before age 59½, you may have to pay ordinary income tax plus a 10% federal penalty tax.

       "  'content': \"Markets are bracing for two near-term challenges related to U.S. government funding. Investors can be sure of one thing: We're in for a period of heightened, enveloping uncertainty.\\nThe immediate challenge is the potential for a government shutdown. That happens—frequently around the October 1 start of the fiscal year—when Congress hasn't authorized the approximately one-third of U.S. spending classified as discretionary. Absent a resolution to temporarily authorize spending, parts of the government will be shut down. It's never pleasant, especially for workers directly affected through the loss of a paycheck. But investors, the markets, and the economy have endured shutdowns before, and no doubt can do so again.\\nA second and potentially greater challenge could materialize around October 18 when, the Treasury Department has warned Congress, the government will no longer be able to pay all its bills unless the $28.5 trillion statutory debt ceiling is increased or suspended.\\nIncreases to the debt ceiling aren't new either. They've occurred dozens of times over the last century, mostly matter-of-factly, a tacit acknowledgement that the bills in question are for spending that Congress has already approved. Episodes in 2011 and 2013, however, were more contentious, leading a major ratings agency to downgrade U.S. debt in the 2011 instance. Failure to address the current challenge could shake global markets even before the Treasury has exhausted its available measures to pay bills.\\nA potential government shutdown: 21 and counting\\nA government shutdown would be the 22nd in 45 years. One was resolved within hours. The last one, in 2018–2019, was the longest on record, at 35 days. Interestingly, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has gained ground more times than it has lost during government shutdowns. And investors who have stayed the course have benefited from the market's penchant to rise over the long term. A greater risk may be that investors give in to the cloud of uncertainty, abandon a well-considered investment plan amid volatility, and lock in losses or miss out on gains.\\nEffects on the economy, meanwhile, typically are related to the duration of a shutdown. The 2018–2019 partial shutdown shaved $3 billion, or 0.02%, off U.S. GDP, after accounting for forgone activity later recouped.1\\nA potential U.S. debt default: Tarnishing a stellar credit history\\nA U.S. debt default, meanwhile, whether through delayed payments on interest owed on U.S. Treasuries or—more likely—on other obligations, would be unprecedented. Its broadest but not intangible effect would be one of perception. We don't doubt for a second the ability of the United States to pay for its obligations. Vanguard's assessment of the minimal credit risk posed by the United States is supported by its strong economic fundamentals, excellent market access and financing flexibility, favorable long-term prospects, and the dollar's status as a global reserve currency.\\nBut perception is tied to the reality that someone isn't going to be paid on time, whether it be government contractors, individuals who receive entitlement payments, or someone else. The damage to U.S. credibility would be irreversible. Even if a default were only technical—if payments other than interest on debt were delayed—the United States could no longer fully reap the benefits bestowed on the most reliable debtors.\\nInterest rates would likely rise, as would financing costs for businesses and individuals. Debt ratings would be at risk. The government's own financing costs, borne by taxpayers, would increase. Stock markets would likely be pressured as higher rates made companies' future cash flows less predictable. Such developments occurring while economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remains incomplete makes the potential scenario all the more important to avoid.\\nStaying the course continues to matter\\nVanguard is well-prepared from an operational standpoint in the event that a default can't be averted. We've taken measures to mitigate risk across the business. The course of events will depend in large part on how long any impasse may endure.\\nMarkets, meanwhile, may turn quickly, in either direction, and with each new development. They're forward-looking and don't like uncertainty, and that combination can result in sharp, sudden swings. Despite the uncertainty—but really, because of it—we continue to recommend that investors be guided by Vanguard's Principles for Investing Success, particularly to have the discipline to focus on a long-term plan even during periods of short-term upheaval.\\nWe don't believe, despite the degree of opposing views, that policymakers will allow a debt default to occur. The stakes are too high. We hope that resolution doesn't occur so late in the process that it inflicts lasting damage on the U.S. economy.\\nStay the course. It's what successful Vanguard investors have done for decades.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Congressional Budget Office, January 2019.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.\\nPast performance does not guarantee future results.\\nWhile U.S. Treasury or government agency securities provide substantial protection against credit risk, they do not protect investors against price changes due to changing interest rates. Unlike stocks and bonds, U.S. Treasury bills are guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest.\"},\n",

We maintain our view of full-year GDP growth of around 5%.\\n\\nOn September 9, the European Central Bank revised its full-year euro area growth forecast from 4.6% to 5.0%, bringing its view in line with ours.\\nGross domestic product grew by a seasonally adjusted 2.2% in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, according to the most recent estimate by Eurostat.\\n\\nChina\\nRisks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside in China, despite the most recent outbreak of the COVID-19 Delta variant appearing to be under control. Given the highly contagious nature of the Delta variant and the relatively low efficacy of China’s vaccine, the risk of further outbreaks and lockdowns remains elevated.\\n\\nWe continue to anticipate full-year economic growth in China at just below 8.5%.\\nChinese government data released September 15 showed slowing growth in both industrial production and retail sales.\\nAugust export data were stronger than expected, helped by a temporary diversion of orders from Southeast Asian nations dealing with COVID-19 and resilient demand from developed markets for tech-related and capital goods.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nCOVID-19 continues to have a divergent story in emerging markets. Emerging Asia, which we had anticipated at the start of the year would be the strongest emerging region for growth, has been beset by low vaccination rates and—given its many \"zero-COVID\" lockdowns—a low rate of infection-acquired immunity as well. The region has struggled with rising case counts.\\n\\nLatin America, which had been hit hard by the coronavirus around midyear, has continued to see case counts fall in recent weeks.\\nWe\\'re watching for the degree to which some of the world\\'s more developed emerging markets, such as South Korea, might be able to use their relatively higher vaccination rates to move away from zero-COVID lockdown approaches, which can weigh on growth.\\n\\nThe Feds asset-purchase tapering may begin sooner\\nMinutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s (FOMC\\'s) July 27–28 meeting suggest the Federal Reserve plans to start to reduce the pace of its asset purchases this year. We\\'ve changed our estimate of when such asset-purchase tapering may begin from the first quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2021.\\n\\nWe believe the Fed will want to see further strong labor market reports before formalizing a tapering plan. (A strong jobs report for July was followed by a relatively weak August report.)\\nThe July meeting minutes show that while most FOMC members believe the Fed has met its price-stability goal for initiating the removal of its policy recommendations, it hasn\\'t met its maximum-employment goal.\\n\\nInflation may not settle down as soon as expected\\nThe inflation environment is likely to be more volatile in coming years than we’ve come to expect recently. Vanguard’s view is that the consensus is too sanguine about inflation in the United States settling into its pre-pandemic trend of 2.0% in 2022.\\n\\nIn our base case, we anticipate that the core Consumer Price Index (CPI)—which excludes volatile food and energy prices—will come in around or above 3% through the first quarter of 2022, settle back just below 2% for some time, and end 2022 above the Federal Reserve\\'s target of 2%.\\nRisks for higher inflation include the potential that current supply-and-demand dislocations could prove less transitory than expected and that inflation expectations could become dislodged and put upward pressure on actual inflation.\\nGlobally, prices have risen as demand has returned to normal levels amid supply shortages in goods, services, and even labor.\\nWe foresee core inflation exceeding central bank targets in the United States and the United Kingdom in the months ahead and settling below the targets in China and the euro area.\\n\\nResurgent demand and supply constraints push up prices\\nNote: Data and Vanguard forecasts are for year-over-year percentage changes in the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Actual inflation is through July 2021 for the United States and the euro area and through June 2021 for the United Kingdom and China. Vanguard forecasts are presented thereafter.

Vanguard believes the number belies the strength of the U.S. labor market.\\n\\nVanguard continues to foresee the unemployment rate falling toward the mid-4% range by year-end.\\nProvided the rate of new COVID-19 Delta variant cases doesn’t require interventions that could change the trajectory of the economic recovery, we foresee a number of forces aligning that should spur a strong upswing in employment in the coming months.\\nThree-month average job growth stands at 750,000, and we anticipate average monthly job growth of around 700,000 for the rest of the year given businesses’ significant need for labor and the expiration of pandemic-related unemployment insurance benefits.\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal.\\nDiversification does not ensure a profit or protect against loss.\\nInvestments in bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.\\nInvestments in stocks or bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk.

At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Why should long-term investors care about market forecasts? Vanguard, after all, has long counseled investors to set a strategy based on their investment goals and to stick to it, tuning out the noise along the way.\\nThe answer, in short, is that market conditions change, sometimes in ways with long-term implications. Tuning out the noise—the day-to-day market chatter that can lead to impulsive, suboptimal decisions—remains important. But so does occasionally reassessing investment strategies to ensure that they rest upon reasonable expectations. It wouldn\\'t be reasonable, for example, for an investor to expect a 5% annual return from a bond portfolio, around the historical average, in our current low-rate environment.\\n\"Treat history with the respect it deserves,\" the late Vanguard founder John C. \"Jack\" Bogle said. \"Neither too much nor too little.\"1\\nIn fact, our Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM), the rigorous and thoughtful forecasting framework that we\\'ve honed over the years, suggests that investors should prepare for a decade of returns below historical averages for both stocks and bonds.\\nThe value of market forecasts rests on reasonable expectations\\nWe at Vanguard believe that the role of a forecast is to set reasonable expectations for uncertain outcomes upon which current decisions depend. In practical terms, the forecasts by Vanguard\\'s global economics and markets team inform our active managers\\' allocations and the longer-term allocation decisions in our multiasset and advice offers. We hope they also help clients set their own reasonable expectations.\\nBeing right more frequently than others is certainly a goal. But short of such a silver bullet, we believe that a good forecast objectively considers the broadest range of possible outcomes, clearly accounts for uncertainty, and complements a rigorous framework that allows for our views to be updated as facts bear out.\\nSo how have our market forecasts fared, and what lessons do they offer?\\nSome errors in our forecasts\\nNotes: The figures show the forecast and realized 10-year annualized returns for a 60% stock/40% bond portfolio, for U.S. equities and for ex-U.S. equities (all U.S. dollar-denominated). On each figure, the last point on the darker line is the actual annualized return from the 10 years beginning October 1, 2010, and ended September 30, 2020, and covers the same period as the Vanguard Capital Markets Model (VCMM) forecast as of September 30, 2010. The last points on the dashed line and the surrounding shaded area are our forecasts for annualized returns at the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of VCMM distributions as of July 31, 2021, for the 10 years ending July 31, 2031. VCMM simulations use the MSCI US Broad Market Index for U.S. equities, the MSCI All Country World ex USA Index for global ex-U.S. equities, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index for U.S. bonds, and the Bloomberg Global Aggregate ex-USD Index for ex-U.S. bonds. The 60/40 portfolio consists of 36% U.S. equities, 24% global ex-U.S. equities, 28% U.S. bonds, and 12% ex-U.S. bonds.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, using data from MSCI and Bloomberg.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nIMPORTANT: The projections\\xa0and\\xa0other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM) regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. The distribution of return outcomes from the VCMM\\xa0is derived from 10,000 simulations for each modeled asset class.\\xa0Simulations for previous forecasts were as of September 30, 2010. Simulations for current forecasts are as of July 31, 2021. Results from the model may vary with each use and over time. For more information, please see Important information below.\\n\\nThe illustration shows that 10-year annualized returns for a 60% stock/40% bond portfolio over the last decade largely fell within our set of expectations, as informed by the VCMM. Returns for U.S. equities surpassed our expectations, while returns for ex-U.S. equities were lower than we had expected.\\nThe data reinforce our belief in balance and diversification. We believe that investors should hold a mix of stocks and bonds appropriate for their goals and should diversify these assets broadly, including globally.\\nYou may notice that our long-run forecasts for a diversified 60/40 portfolio haven\\'t been constant over the last decade, nor have the 60/40 market returns. Both rose toward the end of the decade, or 10 years after markets reached their depths as the global financial crisis was unfolding. Our framework recognized that although economic and financial conditions were poor during the crisis, future returns could be stronger than average. In that sense, our forecasts were appropriate in putting aside the trying emotional strains of the period and focusing on what was reasonable to expect.\\nOur outlook then was one of cautious optimism, a forecast that proved fairly accurate. Today, financial conditions are quite loose—some might even say exuberant. Our framework forecasts softer returns based on today\\'s ultralow interest rates and elevated U.S. stock market valuations. That can have important implications for how much we save and what we expect to earn on our investments.\\nWhy today\\'s valuation expansion limits future U.S. equity returns\\nValuation expansion has accounted for much of U.S. equities\\' greater-than-expected returns over a decade characterized by low growth and low interest rates. That is, investors have been willing, especially in the last few years, to buy a future dollar of U.S. company earnings at higher prices than they\\'d pay for those of ex-U.S. companies.\\nJust as low valuations during the global financial crisis supported U.S. equities\\' solid gains through the decade that followed, today\\'s high valuations suggest a far more difficult climb in the decade ahead. The big gains of recent years make similar gains tomorrow that much harder to come by unless fundamentals also change. U.S. companies will need to realize rich earnings in the years ahead for recent investor optimism to be similarly rewarded.\\nMore likely, according to our VCMM forecast, stocks in companies outside the United States will strongly outpace U.S. equities (PDF)—in the neighborhood of 3 percentage points a year—over the next decade.\\nWe encourage investors to look beyond the median, to a broader set between the 25th and 75th percentiles of potential outcomes produced by our model. At the lower end of that scale, annualized U.S. equity returns would be minuscule compared with the lofty double-digit annual returns of recent years.\\nWhat to expect in the decade ahead\\nThis brings me back to the value of forecasting: Our forecasts today tell us that investors shouldn\\'t expect the next decade to look like the last, and they\\'ll need to plan strategically to overcome a low-return environment. Knowing this, they may plan to save more, reduce expenses, delay goals (perhaps including retirement), and take on some active risk where appropriate.\\nAnd they may be wise to recall something else Jack Bogle said: \"Through all history, investments have been subject to a sort of Law of Gravity: What goes up must go down, and, oddly enough, what goes down must go up.\"2\\n\\xa0\\n1 John C.

At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.\\nCFA® is a registered trademark owned by CFA Institute.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"With the popularity of ETFs on the rise, trading volumes continue to beat records year over year. As a result, those of us on the Capital Markets desk are having numerous conversations about ETF structure and trading dynamics, with our goal being to help as many clients as possible achieve trading success through the best possible execution.\\nOne topic that keeps coming up is the trading of ETFs during the opening and closing auctions. For some of you more accustomed to traditional mutual funds, you find yourself wanting to place trades over the weekend, after the market has closed, or first thing in the morning. While that timing may work for mutual funds that strike a net asset value (NAV) only once a day at 4 p.m., Eastern time, it's not the best for ETFs. Trading ETFs in this manner results in the trade occurring during the opening auction, causing an unnecessary risk of trading the ETF at a larger premium or discount to its fair value, or NAV.\\nBy shining a light on the imbalances that can occur in the opening auction, we hope to provide the keys to help ensure clients have the best possible trading experience.\\nUnderstanding the mechanics of opening auctions can lead to better execution\\nWhen it comes to trading ETFs, the opening price can be dictated by the volume occurring in the auction rather than the price of the underlying securities that make up the ETF. Any trade submitted after the prior trading session ends but before the next begins is queued up for the opening auction, which can expose the trade to additional risks. If there is a large buy imbalance or large sell imbalance, the ETF price can swing to large premiums and discounts.\\nYou don't have to place a large order to receive a poor execution in the opening auction. If an imbalance exists in the opening auction created by other market participants, even the individual that submits a single-share order will participate in the collective execution that could be at a significant premium or discount to the ETF's fair value.\\nWhile exchanges tend to have orderly ETF opening and closing auctions and extreme imbalances with significant price impacts are rare, it's important to understand that the risk does exist, and pricing can be more volatile during ETF auctions without the creation/redemption mechanism. Remember that the creation/redemption mechanism helps ETFs remain close to fair value because new shares can be created or redeemed by liquidity providers who have clear insight into the value of the underlying securities in the fund.\\nWhat an orderly opening auction looks like\\nHere's an example where the opening auction operates in an orderly fashion. There are 10 investors attempting to buy varying share quantities of an ETF valued at $100 using a combination of market orders and limit orders. Simultaneously, there are 10 investors attempting to sell the same ETF. All 20 investors' orders are eligible for the opening auction. This example demonstrates an orderly opening with ETF buy orders perfectly matched against ETF sell orders.\\n\\n\\nETF opening auction (example 1)\\n\\n\\nBuy orders\\nSell orders\\n\\n\\nShare quantity\\nOrder type\\nLimit price\\nShare quantity\\nOrder type\\nLimit price\\n\\n\\n15,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n12,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n\\n\\n3,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n8,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n\\n\\n2,500\\nMarket\\n—\\n3,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n\\n\\n1,500\\nMarket\\n—\\n1,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n\\n\\n1,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n8,000\\nLimit\\n$ 100.01\\n\\n\\n500\\nMarket\\n—\\n4,100\\nLimit\\n$ 101.25\\n\\n\\n500\\nMarket\\n—\\n2,500\\nLimit\\n$ 102.00\\n\\n\\n1,000\\nLimit\\n$ 99.99\\n1,000\\nLimit\\n$ 102.50\\n\\n\\n500\\nLimit\\n$ 99.00\\n1,000\\nLimit\\n$ 103.00\\n\\n\\n200\\nLimit\\n$ 98.00\\n500\\nLimit\\n$ 104.00\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTotal shares: market buy orders\\nTotal shares: market sell orders\\n\\n\\n24,000\\n24,000\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nOpening imbalance\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Vanguard. This hypothetical example does not represent any particular investment.The 24,000 ETF shares would execute at an official opening price of $100, which is in line with the fair value of the fund. This happens because the 24,000 shares on the buy side are offset with the 24,000 shares on the sell side (market orders). As a result, there is no imbalance in the opening auction and the exchange is able to execute all orders without an impact on price.\\nWhat happens when there is an imbalance in the opening auction\\nIn this example, there are 10 investors attempting to buy varying share quantities of an ETF valued at $100 using a combination of market orders and limit orders. Simultaneously, there are 10 investors attempting to sell the same ETF. Again, all 20 investors' orders are eligible for the opening auction. However, this example denotes an opening imbalance that has surprising price ramifications for the ETF.\\n\\n\\nETF opening auction (example 2)\\n\\n\\nBuy orders\\nSell orders\\n\\n\\nShare quantity\\nOrder type\\nLimit price\\nShare quantity\\nOrder type\\nLimit price\\n\\n\\n50,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n3,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n\\n\\n3,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n1,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n\\n\\n1,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n25,000\\nLimit\\n$ 100.05\\n\\n\\n500\\nMarket\\n—\\n10,000\\nLimit\\n$ 100.25\\n\\n\\n100\\nMarket\\n—\\n8,000\\nLimit\\n$ 100.50\\n\\n\\n10,000\\nLimit\\n$ 99.95\\n4,100\\nLimit\\n$ 101.25\\n\\n\\n4,000\\nLimit\\n$ 99.50\\n2,500\\nLimit\\n$ 102.00\\n\\n\\n1,000\\nLimit\\n$ 99.25\\n1,000\\nLimit\\n$ 102.50\\n\\n\\n500\\nLimit\\n$ 99.00\\n1,000\\nLimit\\n$ 103.00\\n\\n\\n200\\nLimit\\n$ 98.00\\n500\\nLimit\\n$ 104.00\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTotal shares: market buy orders\\nTotal shares: market sell orders\\n\\n\\n54,600\\n4,000\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nOpening imbalance\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n50,600\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Vanguard. This hypothetical example does not represent any particular investment.In this example, 54,600 shares would execute at an official opening price of $102.50—250 basis points above the ETF's fair-value price of $100.\\nThe exchange executes all market orders—buy and sell—that participate in the opening auction (with certain exceptions).1 There are market sell orders for only 4,000 shares to try to offset the market buy orders for 54,600 shares, resulting in an opening imbalance of 50,600 shares.\\nThe imbalance forces the exchange to execute limit orders on the sell side starting at the lowest price until it is able to execute all the market buy orders that are part of the opening auction. Therefore, a single investor trying to buy 50,000 shares of an ETF can cause all other participants in the opening auction to trade at a price above the ETF's fair value.\\nGiven the risks of trading in the auctions, consider these best practices:\\n\\nAvoid trades (especially larger-sized trades) during the opening and closing auctions if possible.\\nIf you decide to trade in the auctions, consider using a limit order or marketable limit order to avoid unexpected price movements.\\nBe mindful about placing orders outside of normal market hours for thinly traded ETFs since the opening prices can be significantly affected.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Auction collars and exchange halts are a few examples when market orders may not receive execution in the opening auction.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs,\\xa0obtain a prospectus (or summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-997-2798 to request one.

Unexpected inflation, on the other hand, can erode portfolios\\' purchasing power, a challenge especially for investors with a shorter investment horizon, such as retirees.\\nDo certain asset classes weather unexpected inflation, like we\\'ve seen recently, better than others? Recent Vanguard research suggests that commodities stand apart as a vehicle for hedging against unexpected inflation.\\nOver the last three decades, commodities have had a statistically significant and largely consistent positive inflation beta, or predicted reaction to a unit of inflation. The research, led by Sue Wang, Ph.D., an assistant portfolio manager in Vanguard Quantitative Equity Group, found that over the last decade, commodities\\' inflation beta has fluctuated largely between 7 and 9. This suggests that a 1% rise in unexpected inflation would produce a 7% to 9% rise in commodities.1\\nCommodities’ inflation-hedging power has been strong and consistent\\nNotes: The blue line represents the rolling 10-year beta to unexpected inflation of the Bloomberg Commodity Index. The chart\\'s shading reflects the significance of the inflation beta, with darker shades corresponding to greater significance. Inflation beta significance is a statistical measure determined by both the magnitude and volatility of the beta. Inflation beta with greater significance has a larger potential impact as a hedging mechanism.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, using data from Bloomberg and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers through March 31, 2021.\\n\\nDo other asset classes offer hedges against inflation? Nominal bonds certainly don’t, as a simple fact of mathematics. \"You may not be able to predict the direction of interest rates, but the moment interest rates move, you know exactly what’s happening with your bonds,\" Ms. Wang explained. \"There\\'s not much uncertainty. Increases in inflation lead to higher rates, and bond prices decrease.\"\\nInflation-protected bonds are by their nature intended to hedge against inflation. But with a far lower beta to unexpected inflation (around 1), they would require a significantly higher portfolio allocation to achieve the same hedging effect as commodities.2 \\nThe discussion about equities as an inflation hedge is trickier. Our research reveals a sharp contrast in the hedging power of equities compared with that of commodities. \"Equities have a love-hate relationship with unexpected inflation,\" Ms. Wang said. The contrast presents itself as an inconsistency manifested in three distinct stages over the last three decades.\\nBroad stock index is not a consistent hedge against unexpected inflation\\nNotes: The blue line represents the rolling 10-year beta to unexpected inflation of the Russell 3000 Index. The chart\\'s shading reflects three distinct stages in the last three decades where unexpected inflation beta has undergone a marked shift.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, using data from FTSE Russell and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers through March 31, 2021.\\n\\nThe 1990s marked the \"hate\" stage of the love-hate relationship, Ms. Wang said. More than a decade after the Federal Reserve under then-Chairman Paul Volcker raised interest rates to double digits to combat inflation, the Russell 3000 Index, which represents about 98% of the U.S. equity market, had an unexpected inflation beta ranging from around negative 2 to around negative 9. That means a 1% rise in unexpected inflation would equate to a 2% to 9% decline in the index.\\nThe index\\'s unexpected inflation beta increased and at times turned positive in the 2000s, after the dot-com bubble burst. In the low-growth, low-inflation era of the 2010s, the markets determined that a little inflation wouldn\\'t be a bad thing, and the unexpected inflation beta turned positive and stayed there. \"Any signs of inflation after the global financial crisis were a positive signal for equities,\" Ms. Wang said. The beta has remained positive but has weakened in recent years, suggesting a market less sanguine about what inflation might mean for returns in the years ahead.\\nThe Vanguard research additionally finds that U.S. equities\\' hedging power is likely to decrease in the future, as commodity-related sectors including energy and materials constitute far less of the equity market, and sectors such as technology and consumer discretionary—not effective inflation hedges—constitute more relative to three decades ago.\\n\\xa0\\n1 The Vanguard research is based on the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which reflects futures price movements of commodity sectors including energy, grains, precious metals, industrial metals, livestock, and \"softs,\" such as coffee, cocoa, and sugar.\\n2 The total return of the Bloomberg Commodity Index consists of commodity return and the returns on collateral used in futures contract purchases. The Vanguard research found that using Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (as opposed to three-month Treasury bills) as collateral increased the unexpected inflation beta of the Bloomberg Commodity Index.Notes: \\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

Mobility data suggest activity may be leveling off, though not reversing, as case counts accelerate in some parts of the country. And even where vaccination rates are low, they're robust among those over age 65, who would otherwise most likely have the most adverse health outcomes.\\n\\nWe're watching the economy's resiliency closely, as U.S. output would need to hold around current levels to achieve full-year growth in our forecast range of 7.0% to 7.5%.\\nGDP increased at an annual rate of 6.5% in the second quarter, according to an advance estimate by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).\\n\\nEuro area\\nGrowth momentum remains strong, though high-frequency indicators suggest a modest softening in activity, particularly where cases of the COVID-19 Delta variant have risen.\\n\\nVanguard continues to expect growth in the third quarter to be slightly stronger than in the second, and that full-year growth could reach 5%.\\nGDP remains 3% below its pre-pandemic level, a gap that may be erased late this year.\\n\\nChina\\nIndicators of economic activity in China weakened in July, hit by the COVID-19 Delta variant, flooding in central China, and lagged effects of recent policy tightening. And given that much of the effect of the COVID-19-related lockdowns isn’t reflected in the July numbers, the worst may be yet to come in August.\\n\\nVanguard has downgraded its expectation for third-quarter GDP growth from 1.0% to 0.5%.\\nWe anticipate China's full-year economic growth at just below 8.5%.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nLow COVID-19 vaccination levels have put any impulses toward accelerated growth in emerging markets on hold likely until late this year or early next year, when an anticipated ramp-up in vaccine production is likely to bolster supply.\\n\\nVanguard foresees full-year growth for emerging markets above 6%, with COVID-19 management playing an important role.\\nCountries that have had the most success in warding off COVID-19, notably in Asia, may be at greatest risk of having to initiate further restrictions on economic activity.\\n\\nThe Fed continues to hold the line on rates\\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted on July 28 to leave the target range for its federal funds rate unchanged at 0%–0.25% and its bond buying program unchanged. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that the two components of the Fed’s dual mandate—price stability and maximum sustainable employment—have been “in tension” lately, with inflation having risen higher than the Fed had expected, but with further recovery still to come in the labor market.\\n\\nAlthough the Fed sees inflation at recent levels as transitory, it sees risks as skewed to the upside.\\nVanguard believes the Fed will want to see further labor market gains in the months ahead before it starts paring its pace of asset purchases—and we believe the Fed will indeed see those gains.\\n\\nWatching inflation closely\\nThe most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) release in the United States was consistent with Vanguard's view that prices would begin to moderate after running high in recent months. Still, we're watching closely to determine whether recent higher inflation figures are likely to persist.\\n\\nWe believe that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE), the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure in considering interest rate targets, will remain above the Fed's 2% inflation target until the spring of 2022.\\nPCE differs from CPI in that it measures prices of a broader array of goods and can reweight expenditures as consumers substitute some goods and services for others. Core PCE and CPI exclude volatile food and energy prices.\\n\\nThe potency of commodities as an inflation hedge\\nFinancial markets expect a certain level of inflation and factor it into the asset prices they set, a condition theoretically neutral for investment portfolios. Unexpected inflation, on the other hand, can erode portfolios’ purchasing power, a challenge especially for retirees.\\n\\nRecent Vanguard research suggests that commodities stand apart as a vehicle for hedging against unexpected inflation.\\nOver the last three decades, commodities have had a statistically significant and largely consistent positive inflation beta, or predicted reaction to a unit of inflation.\\n\\nCommodities’ inflation-hedging power has been strong and consistent\\nNotes: The green line represents the rolling 10-year beta to unexpected inflation of the Bloomberg Commodity Index. The chart's shading reflects the significance of the inflation beta, with darker shades corresponding to greater significance. Inflation beta significance is a statistical measure determined by both the magnitude and volatility of the beta. Inflation beta with greater significance has a larger potential impact as a hedging mechanism.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, using data from Bloomberg and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers through March 31, 2021.\\n\\nThe stage is set for stronger job gains\\nWe see a number of forces aligning that should spur a strong upswing in employment in the coming months and pave the way for a full labor-market recovery by mid-2022.\\n\\nSeveral factors contribute to our optimistic outlook. Vaccination rates by September should near their peak. Schools are set to reopen with in-person classes, making more stay-at-home parents available to take jobs.\\nThere's the looming expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits and CARES Act unemployment coverage for workers not traditionally covered by unemployment insurance.\\nVanguard expects monthly job gains to average around 650,000 for the rest of the year, and for the unemployment rate, currently at 5.4%, to fall toward the mid-4.0% range by year-end.\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal.\\nDiversification does not ensure a profit or protect against loss.\\nInvestments in bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.\\nInvestments in stocks or bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk. These risks are especially high in emerging markets.\\nFunds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility.\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. VCMM results will vary with each use and over time.\\nThe VCMM projections are based on a statistical analysis of historical data. Future returns may behave differently from the historical patterns captured in the VCMM. More important, the VCMM may be underestimating extreme negative scenarios unobserved in the historical period on which the model estimation is based.\\nThe Vanguard Capital Markets Model is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguard's primary investment research and advice teams. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"Faced with a market environment of historically low bond yields and interest rates, advisors may be struggling to find a suitable bond portfolio construction approach for their clients. Lower yields mean the bond portion of a portfolio generates less income. It also means that it is increasingly difficult for investors to hit certain yield targets without taking on a greater level of portfolio risk.\\nYour search for yield may lead you to consider an overweight to dividend-paying stocks or differentiated fixed income investments such as high-yield and emerging markets bonds. However, dividend strategies come with a higher level of risk than most bond offerings while not diversifying equity risk. And the aforementioned fixed income investments can meaningfully change the risk profile of a client’s bond allocation.\\nCorporate bond ETFs can enhance the income potential of a bond allocation\\nU.S. investment-grade corporate bonds, particularly when accessed via ETFs, are a good way to enhance the income potential in a bond portfolio in a risk-aware, low-cost manner, while also potentially improving long-term risk-adjusted returns.\\nCurrently, the yield to maturity on a broad-market investment-grade corporate bond ETF such as Vanguard Total Corporate Bond ETF (VTC), is 2.09%, a premium of 0.59% over the yield to maturity on the U.S. aggregate bond market and 1.14% premium over the yield to maturity on the broad U.S. Treasury market.1\\nIt's important to keep in mind that credit risk—the risk that companies may be downgraded or default on their debt—is what mainly drives the yield premium. While this credit risk leads corporate bonds to have a higher return correlation to stocks than to U.S. Treasuries, corporate bonds still offer risk-reduction benefits relative to an equity allocation. And most U.S. investment-grade bonds tend to be of high quality, having an average credit-quality rating of A–.\\nWhy ETFs for corporate bond exposure?\\nETFs have become an established vehicle for investing in the corporate bond market given their diversification, low-cost, versatility, and tax efficiency. We've seen explosive growth in U.S. investment-grade corporate bond ETFs over the past 10 years in both assets under management (AUM) and product count.\\nGrowth of corporate bond ETFs\\nSource: Vanguard, using Morningstar data, as of June 30, 2021.\\nNote: Based on U.S.-listed, ex-ETN (exchange-traded note) issues only. Corporate bond ETF AUM and product count are inclusive of Morningstar’s Corporate Bond category as well as ETFs in the Short Bond and Long Bond categories that have at least 80% of assets invested in corporate bonds.\\n\\nEvaluating corporate bond ETFs\\nWhen evaluating corporate bond ETFs, here are three important things to consider:\\n1. The exposure offered by the ETF\\nUnderstanding the index methodology behind the ETF is critical to help ensure it fits as an appropriate component in the portfolio. Corporate bond ETFs can be differentiated by their maturity/duration exposure (for instance, broad market or short-, intermediate-, or long-term), their credit quality (for instance, some focus on bonds rated at or above one particular rating), or the types of companies they focus on (e.g., sub-sectors or companies that pass certain ESG [environmental, social, and governance] screens).\\xa0\\n2. The ability of the fund manager to tightly track the index\\nUnlike in most equity index ETFs, it is nearly impossible for a bond ETF to own every bond in the index in its precise weight. This is especially true when it comes to the corporate bond market.\\nIn order to tightly track a benchmark, the manager must employ a sophisticated process of optimization.\\nOur optimization process entails replicating the risk factors of a bond ETF’s benchmark. Every day, we match the ETF’s exposures to duration, credit quality, sector exposure, and many more factors to those of the benchmark, within a fraction of a basis point. We strive to own 90%-plus of the bonds in each benchmark, meaning there are thousands of bonds in our diversified index ETFs.\\n3. Investment costs\\nETFs have lowered the cost of investing in the corporate bond market dramatically. In 2010, the average corporate bond mutual fund expense ratio was 0.97%.2 Compare that with the 2020 average corporate bond ETF expense ratio of 0.18%, and you can see the impact ETFs have had on lowering costs in this segment of the bond market.2\\nETFs also confer transaction-cost liquidity. Because it trades on an exchange, the bid-ask spread for a bond ETF depends not only on the liquidity of its underlying bonds but also on its own trading volume. Many corporate bond ETFs are among the most traded ETFs in the world, trading at spreads that are a tiny fraction of the basket spreads, or implicit cost of investing in all the bonds they hold.\\xa0\\nVanguard corporate bond ETFs trade at a fraction of the cost of their underlying bonds\\nSource: Vanguard, using Bloomberg data as of June 30, 2021.\\nNote: Vanguard estimated the underlying bond bid-ask spread using Bond Liquidity Analysis, a proprietary calculation that uses Bloomberg data to estimate an aggregated bid-ask spread for the underlying portfolio of bonds for the 20 trading days ended June 30, 2021.\\n\\nOur corporate bond ETFs offer a maturity-segmented approach\\nAs one of the largest managers of corporate bond ETFs, including Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT)—the largest corporate bond ETF in the world, we bring a wealth of bond-indexing expertise and experience to our lineup.3 \\nVanguard ETF® (ticker) and expense ratio4\\nTotal Corporate Bond ETF (VTC)\\xa0 \\xa00.05%\\nShort-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCSH)\\xa0 \\xa00.05%\\nIntermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT)\\xa0 \\xa00.05%\\nLong-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCLT)\\xa0 \\xa00.05%\\nESG U.S. Corporate Bond ETF (VCEB)\\xa0 \\xa00.12%\\n\\xa0\\n1 Source: Bloomberg Barclays indexes as of June 30, 2021.\\n2 Source: Vanguard, using Morningstar, Inc., data as of December 31, 2020.\\n3 Source: Morningstar, Inc., as of June 30, 2021.\\n4 As reported in each fund's most recent prospectus.

While the markets have calmed and the global economy—despite ongoing public health challenges— continues to emerge from a short but severe recession, it\\'s a good time to reflect on the pandemic\\'s impact on the markets, particularly fixed income.\\nThe \"dash for cash\"\\nFixed income investors responded to the economic shock of the pandemic by rapidly selling assets to bolster their liquidity positions in a dash for cash. This broad divestment overwhelmed traditional channels, leading to a liquidity crunch and price dislocations across multiple fixed income sectors. Even the traditional safe haven of the U.S. Treasury markets experienced notable pressures. The volatility quickly spread to other fixed income sectors across the U.S. and Europe, including commercial paper, corporate bonds, variable-rate demand notes, mortgage-backed securities, and municipal bonds.\\nCauses of the liquidity crunch\\nSeveral factors influenced the strain on the fixed income markets. The general size and complexity of global fixed income markets, the magnitude of selling pressure in certain asset classes, dealers\\' willingness or ability to warehouse assets, and the evolution of fixed income market structure over time all contributed to the breakdown in dealer intermediation. Swift and comprehensive intervention by central banks and policymakers helped restore normal market functioning, with central banks acting as a key liquidity provider and market-maker of last resort.\\nWhat\\'s to be done?\\nAs our research points out, to reduce the likelihood of future intervention by central banks, any policy response should consider ways to enhance the market structure for U.S. Treasury securities, such as ensuring that policymakers have the data necessary to properly surveil the U.S. Treasury market, facilitate market functioning under stress, and inform future regulatory actions. Further, reforms that would foster continuous market-making and improved transparency should be considered. The market for U.S. Treasury securities is a vital part of our global fixed income markets and must be resilient during times of market stress.'},\n",

Government programs, including enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks delivered directly to lower-income earners, have supported consumer spending.\\n\\nThe first estimate of second-quarter GDP in the United States by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is likely to show strong growth, though perhaps below the double digits that some market participants may expect. Vanguard looks for the pace of growth to slow in the second half, though remain strong as positive health outcomes drive a broader reopening of the economy.\\nWe continue to foresee full-year growth of at least 7%, with activity likely peaking late in the second quarter and early in the third.\\n\\nEuro area\\nHigh-frequency indicators, including aggregate purchasing managers\\' indexes near 15-year highs, support Vanguard\\'s view that growth in the euro area hasn\\'t yet peaked. We expect that peak to occur in the third quarter, and we continue to anticipate that the region will experience full-year growth around 4% to 5%.\\n\\nWe expect the recovery to be led by a substantial rebound in consumption in the coming months. The global economic recovery, meanwhile, is supportive of export growth in Germany and Italy.\\nVanguard believes euro area GDP will reach its pre-pandemic level in the first quarter of 2022.\\n\\nChina\\nGrowth momentum in China has faded in recent months in response to tighter fiscal and monetary policy and slowing export growth. We expect support from the export sector to wane and consumption growth to normalize slowly, given sporadic virus outbreaks and an initially slow vaccination rollout.\\n\\nChina\\'s composite purchasing managers\\' index remains above the 50 level that signifies growth, but the reading has fallen for two straight months, evidence of the slowing momentum.\\nThat slowing momentum recently led Vanguard to cut its full-year forecast for China growth from 9% to just above 8.5%.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nVirus resurgence, particularly in emerging Asia, has slowed first-half 2021 growth. Vanguard remains optimistic that emerging markets will post full-year 2021 growth above 6%, which is above consensus.\\n\\nWe believe that emerging markets could get a bounce in 2022, as well, from strengthening developed markets.\\nOur view depends to no small degree on the pace to which emerging markets can accelerate their vaccination efforts.\\n\\nA strong but uneven global recovery\\nThe degree to which economic activity can resume depends on the staying power of COVID-19 and its variants.\\n\\nVaccination progress suggests an uneven global economic recovery. Consumers are more likely to engage in face-to-face economic activity where vaccination rates are greatest.\\nEmerging markets remain at greater risk from COVID-19 and its variants than developed markets given the pace of vaccinations.\\n\\nPercentage of population with at least one vaccine dose\\nNotes: Levels that constitute herd immunity will vary by region, depending on vaccine efficacy. Higher vaccination rates generally permit greater economic activity.\\nSources: Vanguard projections, based on data from Our World in Data, the University of Oxford, and the Australian federal government as of June 1, 2021. No projections are available for Canada and Mexico.\\n\\nPersistent inflation remains a risk\\nProspects for stimulative fiscal policy and only a gradual readjustment of a supply-and-demand imbalance increase the likelihood of moderately higher inflation more persistently. We don\\'t, however, foresee a return to 1970s-style runaway inflation. There is a risk that significantly more fiscal spending on the order of $2 trillion to $3 trillion—our \"go big\" scenario in the chart below—could lead inflation to significantly overshoot the Fed\\'s target later this year and into 2022.\\n\\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States rose by a greater-than-expected 0.9% in June compared with May, and 5.4% since June 2020, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday, July 13.\\nThe rises were the greatest for both readings since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.9% compared with May and 4.5% compared with June 2020.\\nThe index for used cars and trucks, up 10.5% in June, accounted for more than a third of the seasonally adjusted all-items increase.\\nVanguard sees a risk that inflation could be more persistent if sectoral drivers of inflation remain strong. The Federal Reserve\\'s preferred measure of inflation, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), moderated somewhat in May, rising 0.4% compared with a month earlier after a revised 0.6% gain in April.\\nCompared with a year earlier, core PCE increased by 3.9% in May, higher than the 3.6% increase in April.\\nVanguard expects year-on-year readings of core PCE to remain above 2% into 2022 amid supply constraints that could push sector-level prices higher.\\n\\nInflation: Up, up … but not away in 2021\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from January 1995 through April 2021 from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nFed likely to remain dovish\\nWe foresee accommodative policy remaining in place the rest of the year, though talk of reducing the pace of asset purchases will ramp up in the second half. We don\\'t foresee conditions meeting the Federal Reserve\\'s rate-hike criteria until the second half of 2023.\\n\\nThe U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted on June 16 to leave the target range for its federal funds rate unchanged at 0%–0.25% and its bond-buying program unchanged. A survey of FOMC members, however, suggested the Fed now foresees the timing of its first post-pandemic rate hikes in 2023, rather than in 2024 as per the previous survey, in March.\\nVanguard expects the Fed\\'s balance sheet guidance to ramp up in the second half of 2021 amid economic uncertainty that remains high.\\nWe expect policy largely to remain dovish, with the Fed tolerating above-target inflation over the medium term.\\nGlobally, we find that central bank policy rates and interest rates more broadly are likely to rise, but only modestly, in the next several years.\\nOur view that lift-off from current low policy rates may occur in some cases only two years from now reflects, among other things, an only gradual recovery from the pandemic’s significant effect on labor markets.\\nAlongside rises in policy rates, Vanguard expects central banks, in our base-case \"reflation\" scenario, to slow and eventually stop their purchases of government bonds, allowing the size of their balance sheets as a percentage of GDP to fall back toward pre-pandemic levels.\\nWe expect higher policy rates and smaller central bank balance sheets to cause only a modest lift in yields.\\n\\nUnemployment rate expected to fall\\nThe job market in the United States gained momentum in June, as 850,000 non-farm jobs were created.\\n\\nVanguard expects monthly job gains to average around 650,000 for the rest of the year, and for the unemployment rate, currently at 5.9%, to fall toward the mid-4% range by year-end.\\nIn the leisure and hospitality sector, job-churning (workers\\' leaving one employer for another) is at 20-year highs amid fierce labor competition. We see that situation normalizing in the months ahead.\\nLabor force dynamics could change noticeably around September as enhanced unemployment benefits and CARES Act unemployment coverage of workers not traditionally covered expire, as schoolchildren return to classrooms allowing parents to return to workplaces, and as vaccination rates near their peak.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The outlook for the global economy continues to hinge on health outcomes. In our annual economic and market outlook published at the end of 2020, Vanguard economists expected that the path to recovery would be uneven and varied across industries and countries, even once effective vaccines for COVID-19 became available.\\nFast forward half a year. The pandemic is still far from over as new virus variants surface where vaccination rates lag and as the human toll continues to mount, especially in less developed economies. Yet macroeconomic indicators signal that the global economy is rebounding faster than many had expected from its sharpest contraction in modern history. That rebound is reflected in our current full-year GDP growth forecasts, which remain roughly in line with our optimistic projections at the start of 2021. In some places, we've upgraded our forecasts; in others, we've downgraded them.\\xa0\\nCountries that have contained the virus more successfully, whether through vaccinations, lockdowns, or both, have tended to see their economies hold up better, said Andrew Patterson, senior international economist in Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group. As economies open up, demand—supported in many countries by government spending—will promote growth and, by extension, underlie our outlooks for inflation and monetary policy. Given Vanguard’s focus on return expectations over the long term, revisions to our investment return outlooks remain a function of valuations and risks informed by current and expected future macroeconomic conditions and policy.\\nVaccination rates and fiscal support are driving the economic recovery\\nThe extraordinary global response to the pandemic has set the stage for a strong economic recovery. Vaccines were developed, tested, and made available faster than many anticipated. By our estimates, shown in the chart below, about 75% of the world's population will have received at least one vaccine dose by the end of 2021, putting herd immunity in the largest economies within reach.1 The reaction of governments and central banks has also been impressive, as many moved swiftly to provide unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary support.\\nPercentage of population with at least one vaccine dose\\nNotes: Levels that constitute herd immunity will vary by region, depending on vaccine efficacy. Higher vaccination rates generally permit greater economic activity.\\nSources: Vanguard projections, based on data from Our World in Data, the University of Oxford, and the Australian federal government as of June 1, 2021. No projections are available for Canada and Mexico.\\n\\nAt the same time, the chart shows that vaccination rates have differed significantly by country and region. So have outcomes from policymakers' efforts to blunt COVID-19's economic impact. Both factors are likely to contribute to the recovery’s continued unevenness for the rest of this year and beyond.\\nOur full-year GDP growth forecasts still reflect how far we’ve had to climb back to approach pre-pandemic growth. In the United States, for example, where positive health care developments and strong fiscal support are driving growth, we’ve raised our full-year forecast to at least 7%. Vaccination programs accelerated after a somewhat slow start, paving the way for the reopening of segments of the economy that depend heavily on face-to-face interaction. Government programs, including enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks delivered directly to lower-income earners, have supported consumer spending.\\nFor the euro area, our forecast for 2021 growth of around 5% is unchanged. A halting start to vaccination rollouts and repeated lockdowns tipped the bloc back into recession early this year, but supportive policy, an easing of travel restrictions, and consumption that remains 10% below its pre-pandemic trend could underpin a strong bounce-back.\\nFor China, we have lowered our 2021 forecast to around 8.5%. The country has largely contained the pandemic and was the first to return to its pre-COVID GDP level, but consumption is taking time to normalize amid slow vaccination rollouts and sporadic virus outbreaks. Domestic consumption may continue to lag even as vaccinations ramp up, but exports have boosted China's economy.\\nFor emerging markets, we have raised our forecast for 2021 to above 6%. A resurgence of the virus, particularly in emerging Asia, weighed on growth in the first half of this year, but growth should accelerate as vaccination efforts advance.\\nHow faster growth could affect inflation and monetary policy\\nVarious factors are fanning concerns about higher inflation, including the stronger-than-expected rebound in global growth, extraordinary and unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus, and a jump in demand for goods and services as economies reopen and supply gradually comes back online. Although we expect the effects to be largely transitory, our outlook is for a modest but eventually persistent increase in inflation.\\nImproving economies and somewhat higher inflation are, in turn, spurring questions about monetary policy. Some central banks have already begun slowing the pace of asset purchases put in place at the start of the pandemic, and others are contemplating doing so. Such moves constitute a gradual removal of accommodative monetary policy. We nevertheless expect that initial increases in central bank short-term rates won't occur broadly before 2023.\\nU.S. inflation risks are higher than those in other countries given some supply-and-demand imbalances. Diminished supply of goods, including new and used cars, and of labor, amid demand rebounds in some sectors, might take time to unwind. Our baseline scenario, shown in the chart below, is that core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy prices) will persist above the Federal Reserve's 2% target in the second half of 2021 before moderating in 2022.\\nThere is a risk, however, that significantly more fiscal spending on the order of $2 trillion to $3 trillion—our “go big” scenario in the chart below—could lead inflation to significantly overshoot the Fed's target later this year and into 2022. Such a development could affect inflation psychology, in which higher expected inflation can lead to higher actual inflation.\\nInflation: Up, up … but not away in 2021\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from January 1995 through April 2021 from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nWith its 2020 adoption of “average inflation targeting,” which makes 2% a longer-term goal rather than an upper limit, the Fed may be more comfortable letting inflation run reasonably above 2% for some time. We foresee accommodative policy persisting for the rest of 2021, though plans for reducing the pace of asset purchases are likely to be disclosed in the second half. We currently don’t foresee conditions meeting the Fed’s rate-hike criteria of price stability and maximum sustainable employment until the second half of 2023.\\nHeadline inflation, as shown in the chart below, is likely to follow similar paths in the euro area and the United Kingdom. Euro-area energy prices are likely to push headline inflation above 2% in the second half of 2021, but underlying price pressures remain subdued. We foresee core inflation rising to a range of 1% to 1.5% by year-end, slightly higher than our view when 2021 began. The European Central Bank is likely to keep interest rates on hold at least through 2022, even as the economy improves, though it will probably slow its pace of asset purchases in the near term.\\nHeadline inflation in the euro area and U.K. is likely to moderate in 2022\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from January 2019 through May 2021 from the UK Office for National Statistics and Eurostat.\\n\\nWe continue to foresee core inflation in China of around 1.5% for 2021, well below the People's Bank of China's 3% target. Although producer prices have climbed, we expect pass-through effects to remain limited, especially amid modest consumer demand. We expect monetary policy to continue to normalize, but only gradually as economic growth remains uneven.\\nInflation in emerging markets has been higher than expected. A disinflationary trend in parts of Asia has disappeared, and inflation in other regions has largely risen above its pre-pandemic pace as higher borrowing costs in developed markets spill over. Inflation dynamics and rising U.S. interest rates have constrained central banks' accommodative bias even as economic growth remains below potential. Recent rate hikes in Brazil, Russia, and Turkey amid rising inflation demonstrate the challenge.\\nWhere our 10-year return forecasts stand\\nStarting valuations matter. Global stocks this year have continued to rally from pandemic lows, and that will make further gains harder to come by. In fact, our 10-year annualized return forecasts for some developed markets are nearly 2 percentage points lower than they were at the end of 2020.\\nThe news is better for bond investors. Because we expect bond portfolios of all types and maturities to earn returns close to their current yield levels, the recent increase in market interest rates has led us to raise our 10-year annualized return forecasts by a half to a full percentage point for a number of markets.\\nOur forecasts, in local currencies, are derived from a May 31, 2021, running of the Vanguard Capital Markets Model®. The figures are based on a 1-point range around the 50th percentile of the distribution of return outcomes for equities and a 0.5-point range around the 50th percentile for bonds.\\nHere are our current 10-year annualized return forecasts:\\nU.S. stocks: 2.4% to 4.4%; Ex-U.S. stocks: 5.2% to 7.2%.\\nU.S. bonds: 1.4% to 2.4%; Ex-U.S. bonds: 1.3% to 2.3% when hedged in U.S. dollars.\\nEuro-area stocks: 2.9% to 4.9%; Ex-euro-area stocks: 1.6% to 3.6%.\\nEuro-area bonds: –0.5% to 0.5%; Ex-euro-area bonds: –0.5% to 0.5% when hedged in euros.\\nChinese stocks: 5.1% to 7.1%; Ex-China stocks: 3.6% to 5.6%.\\nChinese bonds: 2.8% to 3.8%.\\n\\xa0\\nIMPORTANT: The projections\\xa0and\\xa0other information generated by the VCMM regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results.

Results from the model may vary with each use and over time. For more information, please see important information below.\\nA final word about bonds and portfolios\\nEven with our upward revisions, returns from bonds in most markets are likely to be modest. We nonetheless still see their primary role in a portfolio as providing diversification from riskier assets rather than generating returns.\\nKeep in mind that return forecasts change in response to evolving assessments of economic and market conditions, but that doesn't mean your investment plan should change. In fact, long-term investors often have the best chance of investment success by staying the course if their investment plan is diversified across asset classes, sectors, and regions and is in line with their investment goals and tolerance for risk.\\nIn addition, for clients concerned about the impact of shifting market conditions on their retirement portfolios, consider sharing this recent piece that explains how a dynamic spending plan can have a dampening effect on portfolio volatility.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Herd immunity is the point at which a virus’ spread becomes harder because numbers of vaccinated and already-infected people have reached a certain threshold.\\n\\xa0Important information\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account.\\nThere is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.\\nInvestments in stocks or bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk. These risks are especially high in emerging markets.\\nBond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time, and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments.\\nAbout the Vanguard Capital Markets Model:\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. VCMM results will vary with each use and over time.\\nThe VCMM projections are based on a statistical analysis of historical data. Future returns may behave differently from the historical patterns captured in the VCMM. More important, the VCMM may be underestimating extreme negative scenarios unobserved in the historical period on which the model estimation is based.\\nThe Vanguard Capital Markets Model® is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time.

       "  'content': 'Our factor ETFs recently celebrated their three-year anniversary. Crossing this threshold provided a great opportunity to check in with Antonio Picca, head of Vanguard Factor-Based Strategies, about the current state of our lineup, the market environment, and strategies to implement factor-based investing in your portfolio construction approach.\\nVanguard factor ETFs recently hit their three-year mark. Now that they have achieved this milestone, can you provide some thoughts and insights into the first three years for Vanguard\\'s first actively managed ETFs?\\nIt has been a wild ride! Who could have predicted a pandemic-fueled rally happening at the top of the longest bull run in the history of the U.S. stock market? In this environment, our factor ETFs experienced some of the largest movements ever observed in 90+ years of historical data. This is partly the result of our design choices.\\nWhen designing the funds, we made the deliberate choice of targeting factors across the capitalization spectrum. Each portfolio is split evenly across large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks because we believe that gives them the best potential for outperformance over the long term. Factor premiums can show up at different times and in different parts of the market-cap spectrum, so it\\'s important to be diversified across the whole spectrum in order to capture the premium when it\\'s there.\\nThis decision turned out to be a major headwind in the first couple of years, with the market driven exclusively by a small group of mega-cap growth stocks. We were forced to face tough questions such as \"Are factors broken?\" and \"Does your approach make sense in a winner-takes-all economy?\" There was no simple answer to these tough questions. However, what kept us optimistic was the observation that similar dynamics happened in the late \\'90s and early \\'70s, coinciding with the second- and third-longest bull runs in the U.S. market\\'s history.\\nOur optimism was finally validated last year, when the COVID shock changed the market narrative and factors started delivering stronger performance across the capitalization spectrum. As you can see from the chart below, the early days of our factor products saw a handful of large-cap growth stocks driving market performance. While the COVID shock made this trend even more pronounced, we are beginning to see a strong comeback in value and small-cap stocks as the country emerges from the pandemic.\\nA changing market narrative leads to stronger factor performance across the capitalization spectrum\\nSource: FactSet, based on data from February 13, 2018, through May 25, 2021. For standardized performance for VFVA click here.\\nThe performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, so investors’ shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data cited. For performance data current to the most recent month end, visit our website at vanguard.com/performance. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\nWe\\'ve recently seen a market environment that has been more favorable to small-cap and value stocks. Why are our factor ETFs uniquely positioned to take advantage of this current market trend?\\nSo far value stocks have been the protagonists of the economic recovery. Their performance really shined once there was positive news about the efficacy of the COVID vaccines and a strong economic stimulus. This fell perfectly in line with our expectations since value stocks are pro-cyclical and tend to do their best during periods of economic recovery.\\nThe small-cap performance reflects the broadening market leadership of stocks that were previously ignored by investors but are getting a second chance. This is key when evaluating how our factors may perform going forward. The dichotomy between growth and value is so ingrained into the common narrative that most people tend to think that we are going from a lopsided market obsessed with a small group of high-flying technology and media companies, to one dominated by small-cap energy and financial companies.\\nAs this obsession for growth wanes, it creates opportunities for other companies across the capitalization spectrum and across factors. All of our factors (value, quality, momentum, liquidity, multifactor, and minimum volatility) are well positioned to benefit from this, not just our value product. Even our momentum strategy is positioned to take advantage as our active implementation approach has allowed us to quickly transition from a growth play through most of 2020 to a value/broader play in early 2021.\\nIf you don\\'t believe me, just look at their valuations! Despite the recent performance rebound, our factors are still trading at historically low valuations compared with the broad equity market. This means that there is still the potential to outperform over the next 3, 5, and 10 years. Value, for example, would need to outperform the Russell 3000 Index by 35% to get back in line with its average historical valuation relative to the market.\\nMarket factors trading at historically low valuations versus the broad market\\nSource: Refinitiv Financial Solutions, based on data through May 31, 2021.\\n\\xa0\\nMethodology: Relative valuations are computed as the price to forward-earnings of the factor portfolios divided by the price to forward-earnings of the Russell 3000 Index. The price to forward-earnings ratio is computed as the weighted average of the stocks’ market capitalization divided by the weighted average of their 12-month forward earnings from I/B/E/S (Institutional Brokers Estimate System). The weights used in the average correspond to the factor portfolios and Russell 3000 weights, respectively. The 12-month forward earnings from I/B/E/S are weighted at 2.5% and 97.5% of the Russell 3000 universe.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\n\\nRelative valuations versus the Russell 3000 Index\\nSource: Refinitiv Financial Solutions, based on data through May 31, 2021.\\n\\xa0\\nMethodology: Relative valuations are computed as the price to forward-earnings of the factor portfolios divided by the price to forward-earnings of the Russell 3000 Index.

The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhat is your outlook for factor-based products going forward?\\nDespite some challenges for value, which is the poster child for factor investing, factors have proved that they can deliver strong outcomes for investors and I believe they will continue to do so in the future.\\nIf you think about where the investment landscape is going, with greater focus on technology and customization, it is hard to see a future where factors don\\'t play an important role in an investor\\'s portfolio.\\nIt is easy to lose focus of that long-term trend if you follow the markets these days, with flashy hedge funds, meme stocks, and cryptocurrencies capturing all of the headlines. But I think that factor-based ETFs will continue to garner assets from traditional forms of active management and even from broad-market investing going forward.\\nCan you provide some examples of how you’ve seen advisors implementing our factor ETFs into their portfolio construction approach?\\nOver the last three years, we\\'ve worked with many advisors helping them incorporate factors into their clients\\' portfolios. We\\'re still seeing a large dispersion in factor knowledge across the investor spectrum. Those who are further along their factor journey have generally a strong idea about which factors they wish to target and how they can be used strategically (as a large percentage of their allocation intended to be held for a long time horizon) or tactically (leaning into a factor more aggressively based on its valuation or momentum with perhaps a shorter-term horizon).\\nOur Portfolio and Analytics team has also worked with investors who aren\\'t as familiar with factors yet want to substitute current active manager allocations with a lower-cost factor portfolio. Many fall somewhere in between. These folks generally combine many factors together and use a multifactor approach as the satellite of their allocation.\\xa0\\nCheck out our factor ETF lineup\\nCustomize clients’ tilts toward the factors that influence portfolio performance\\nU.S. Value Factor ETF\\xa0 (VFVA)\\nU.S. Quality Factor ETF (VFQY)\\nU.S. Liquidity Factor ETF (VFLQ)\\nU.S. Momentum Factor ETF (VFMO)\\nU.S. Multifactor ETF (VFMF)\\nU.S. Minimum Volatility ETF (VFMV)\\n\\xa0Notes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs, obtain a prospectus (or a summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-523-1036 to request one.

Most of our managers consider these factors even for products without an explicit ESG investment strategy. The industry regularly refers to this approach as ESG integration, and it is used in both fixed income and equity investing.\\nWe regularly assess how our external managers use ESG factors to inform their investment decisions and how their approaches evolve over time. We review how they gather ESG information, whether they employ dedicated analysts, and how they interact with those analysts. Our fund managers recognize that assessing material ESG risks is a competitive advantage for driving excess return.\\nOur actively managed Vanguard Global ESG Select Stock Fund Admiral Shares (VESGX) employs an ESG integration strategy and invests only in companies that meet the advisor’s ESG criteria.\\nWe engage with the portfolio companies in our index funds\\nThe Vanguard Investment Stewardship team continuously engages with the companies in which our index funds invest to better understand how they are addressing material ESG risks given that these risks may undermine returns over the long run.\\nSome firms respond to our stewardship activities, adopt best practices, and demonstrate clear and measurable progress toward risk reduction. Other companies are less proactive in mitigating material risks. But since an index fund must hold all, or a representative sample, of the companies in its benchmark index, when a portfolio company fails to address a material risk, we use investment stewardship activities, such as voting our funds' proxies, to further encourage action to preserve shareholder value.\\nContinuously evaluating the ESG landscape\\nWe believe that, if left unchecked, ESG risks can undermine a company's future long-term value. Additionally, we believe that, over time, well-governed companies that mitigate material risks will outperform those that are poorly governed. That said, there is no right style of ESG investing, and the landscape continues to develop rapidly. As such, we plan to continuously evaluate ESG opportunities for both index providers and active managers.\\nThe most important consideration is selecting an approach that is unique to each of your clients. And you should never sacrifice the tenets of diversification and low cost in constructing a portfolio that aligns with your clients’ ESG investing goals.\\nNotes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs,\\xa0obtain a prospectus\\xa0(or a summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-523-1036 to request one.

       "  'content': 'The COVID-19 pandemic made it abundantly clear that central banks had the tools, and were willing to use them, to counter a dramatic fall-off in global economic activity. That economies and financial markets were able to find their footing so quickly after a few downright scary months in 2020 was in no small part because of monetary policy that kept bond markets liquid and borrowing terms super-easy.\\nNow, as newly vaccinated individuals unleash their pent-up demand for goods and services on supplies that may initially struggle to keep up, questions naturally arise about resurgent inflation and interest rates, and what central banks will do next.\\nVanguard\\'s global chief economist, Joe Davis, recently wrote how the coming rises in inflation are unlikely to spiral out of control and can support a more promising environment for long-term portfolio returns. Similarly, in new research on the unwinding of loose monetary policy, we find that central bank policy rates and interest rates more broadly are likely to rise, but only modestly, in the next several years.Prepare for policy rate lift-off … but not immediately\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nLift-off date\\n\\n\\n2025\\n\\n\\n2030\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. Federal Reserve\\n\\n\\nQ3 2023\\n\\n\\n1.25%\\n\\n\\n2.50%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBank of England\\n\\n\\nQ1 2023\\n\\n\\n1.25%\\n\\n\\n2.50%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEuropean Central Bank\\n\\n\\nQ4 2023\\n\\n\\n0.60%\\n\\n\\n1.50%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes: Lift-off date is the projected date of increase in the short-term policy interest rate target for each central bank from its current low. Rates for 2025 and 2030 are Vanguard projections for each central bank’s policy rate.\\nSource: Vanguard forecasts as of May 13, 2021.Our view that lift-off from current low policy rates may occur in some cases only two years from now reflects, among other things, an only gradual recovery from the pandemic’s significant effect on labor markets. (My colleagues Andrew Patterson and Adam Schickling wrote recently about how prospects for inflation and labor market recovery will allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to be patient when considering when to raise its target for the benchmark federal funds rate.)\\nAlongside rises in policy rates, Vanguard expects central banks, in our base-case \"reflation\" scenario, to slow and eventually stop their purchases of government bonds, allowing the size of their balance sheets as a percentage of GDP to fall back toward pre-pandemic levels. This reversal in bond-purchase programs will likely put some upward pressure on yields.\\nWe expect balance sheets to remain large relative to history, however, because of structural factors, such as a change in how central banks have conducted monetary policy since the 2008 global financial crisis and stricter capital and liquidity requirements on banks. Given these changes, we don\\'t expect shrinking central bank balance sheets to place meaningful upward pressure on yields. Indeed, we expect higher policy rates and smaller central bank balance sheets to cause only a modest lift in yields. And we expect that, through the remainder of the 2020s, bond yields will be lower than they were before the global financial crisis.\\nThree scenarios for 10-year bond yields\\nSources: Historical government bond yield data sourced from Bloomberg. Vanguard forecasts, as of May 13, 2021, generated from Vanguard’s proprietary vector error correction model.\\n\\nWe expect yields to rise more in the United States than in the United Kingdom or the euro area because of a greater expected reduction in the Fed\\'s balance sheet compared with that of the Bank of England or the European Central Bank, and a Fed policy rate rising as high or higher than the others\\'.\\nOur base-case forecasts for 10-year government bond yields at decade’s end reflect monetary policy that we expect will have reached an equilibrium—policy that is neither accommodative nor restrictive.

       "  'content': \"Over the last 10 years, U.S. growth stocks outperformed U.S. value stocks by an average of 7.8% per year.1 Powered by a relentless rise in technology share prices, growth stocks have handily outpaced value since the 2008 global financial crisis. Simply put, growth has historically never outperformed value as it has over this past decade.\\nAre we seeing a reversal of fortune with the value premium asserting itself once again? Will your clients' asset allocation strategies be positioned to take advantage of this shift?\\nVanguard's latest research suggests that there is a fundamental explanation for some of value stocks' recent woes, such as the inflation and growth environment, but that the narrative has been oversold. Based on our fair-value model, we expect value to outperform growth over the next 10-year period by as much as 5% to 7% per year and perhaps by even more over the next five years.\\nThe unprecedented recent outperformance of growth over value\\nSource: Fama-French research returns, outlined at http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html#Research.\\nNotes: The chart displays annualized 10-year trailing returns of a long-short value versus growth portfolio over the period from June 1936 to January 2021 constructed using Fama-French methodology, available at https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/f-f_5_factors_2x3.html. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.\\n1 Value and growth are represented by a market-capitalization-weighted index of companies in the bottom and top thirds of the Russell 1000 Index, sorted by price/book ratios and reconstituted monthly. Data are as of February 28, 2021.\\n\\nSecular trends are driving fair values, but the market may have overreacted\\nOur model suggests that value stocks’ underperformance in recent years owes mainly to fundamental drivers, notably, low inflation rates, which boosted the relative attractiveness of growth stocks' more distant cash flows. But investor behavior played a role as well.\\nThe model highlights some key points about our fair-value estimates:\\n\\nThe decline in the fair value of value/growth has more to do with a large increase in the fair value of growth/market than with a large decrease in that of value/market.\\nValue stocks are much more sensitive to cyclical drivers such as market volatility and corporate profits than are growth stocks.\\nGrowth and value appear to be at the upper and lower bounds of their respective fair value to market estimates.\\n\\nValue stock price/book ratio divided by growth stock price/book ratio\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from FactSet, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Reserve Board, Thomson Reuters, and Global Financial Data.\\nNote: The statistical model specification is a seven-variable vector error correction (VEC) that includes the following variables: prior-period ratio of price/book, 10-year trailing inflation, 10-year real U.S. Treasury yield, equity volatility, growth of corporate profits, and ratio of R&D expense/book value estimated over the period from January 1979 to February 2021.\\n\\nValue signaling a resurgence\\nWe believe that cyclical value-growth rotations are rooted in investor behavior and that investors become more price-conscious when profit growth is strong. Since 2008, corporate profit growth has been insufficient to sustain value stocks.\\nAs inflation normalizes, we expect it to eventually exceed the Federal Reserve's target. Improved performance from the energy, materials, and financial sectors may be signaling a resurgence in these beaten-down value-oriented segments. However, the ultimate driver of the predicted rotation to value stocks is apt to be a change in investors' appetite for risk.\\nOur research found that deviations from fair value and future relative returns share an inverse and statistically significant relationship over the next 5- and 10-year periods. The relationship is an affirmation that, ultimately, valuations matter—that the price we pay influences our return.\\nThe drivers of value outperformance over the next 5- and 10-year periods\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from FactSet.\\nNotes: Returns are calculated based on a modeled reversion to fair value and a projection of the fair-value ratio of value/growth price/book. Total return in panel c is the sum of the return components in panels a and b at each percentile. Note that numbers may differ slightly because of rounding.\\n\\nEventually, we believe that value will take the lead again, as it did through most of the first decade of this millennium. For investors with sufficient risk tolerance, time horizons, and patience, an overweight to value stocks could help offset the lower broad-market returns we expect over the next decade.\"},\n",

We've been able to achieve returns that are excess of the benchmark through a varied market environment. When markets are rallying or selling off, the fund's been able to beat its benchmark. And that's what we strive to do by taking really smart, intelligent risk when the market gives us that opportunity and being patient when the market does not give us the opportunity.\\nDaniel: The fund has performed very well.

An active manager needs to be patient, nimble, and disciplined, and I thought we exhibited all three of those traits in 2020.\\nDaniel: Going into the year, we took a more defensive stance in credits, observing the tight levels of credit spreads and the inability of those spreads to cushion against market risks. By January and February, as the rest of the world was taking comfort in the resilience of U.S. equity indices, we were looking at the impact of the virus in Asia and reducing exposure to more growth-sensitive sectors.\\nBrian: When the pandemic hit U.S. shores and risk assets cheapened dramatically, we were in a perfect position to take full advantage. We were able to use the liquidity that we had built earlier to rotate back into those riskier sectors at significantly more attractive levels.\\nArvind: This allowed us to really outperform the benchmarks through the year, and we were able to generate a lot of performance through the second half of the year.

       "  'content': \"Clients don't always have the luxury of choosing to retire as financial markets are rising. Yet, the timing of clients' transition out of the working world can have a tremendous impact on their retirement savings longevity.\\nAs Vanguard research has shown, sequence-of-return risk—the threat to a successful retirement posed by a concentrated run of poor market performance—can be substantial, especially if it happens early in retirement. This risk can mean lower-than-hoped-for retirement income, early exhaustion of retirement savings principal, or both.\\nFortunately, you and your clients can leverage much more than lucky timing to boost their chances of a financially comfortable retirement. Small adjustments to retirement spending, guided by actual market conditions, can go a long way toward boosting the probability of long-term retirement success (that is, spending that's sustainable for life, while affording the client a satisfactory lifestyle). This article examines the dynamic spending strategy for sustaining retirement savings and provides resources to deepen your and your clients' understanding of this important concept.\\nSpending in a market decline—the issues\\nIdeally, no one wants to enter retirement during a prolonged and significant market decline. After all, a market shock reduces a client portfolio's value, diminishing the amount that can safely be withdrawn. But it's not entirely bad news: By lowering the valuations of securities, the shock can also raise expected returns, potentially offsetting some of this decline. A decline in stock market valuations has tended to be associated with higher future returns.1\\nIn a series of Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM) simulations, this rise in expected returns meant that the decline in sustainable spending was shallower than the decline in the portfolio's value. At the end of December 2019, VCMM projections suggested that a $1 million portfolio could sustain $45,000 in annual spending, adjusted for inflation (dollar plus inflation rule), for 30 years. In 10,000 simulations, the portfolio met this target 85% of the time. After the market shock, the $1 million portfolio fell to $800,000, a 20% decline. However, as expected returns rose, sustainable spending dropped by less than 10%, to $40,800.2\\nIn simple terms, a comparatively small reduction—by percentage—in annual spending can preserve a portfolio after it's been hit by a much larger market shock.\\nFigure 1. Sustainable spending in times of crisis\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the VCMM regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. Distribution of return outcomes from VCMM are derived from 10,000 simulations for each modeled asset class. Simulations as of December 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020. Results from the model may vary with each use and over time. For more information, please see the disclosure at the end of this article.\\nNotes: The results assume an 85% success rate over a 30-year time horizon. The time horizon precrisis is 30 years after December 2019. The time horizon postcrisis is 30 years after March 2020. The ceiling is 5% and the floor is –1.5%. The asset allocation is domestic equity 30%, international equity 20%, domestic fixed income 35%, and international fixed income 15%. U.S. equities represented by the MSCI US Broad Market Index; global ex-U.S. equities represented by MSCI All Country World ex USA Index; U.S. bonds represented by Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index; global ex-U.S. bonds represented by Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate ex-USD Index, using data as of December 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020. Forecast corresponds to distribution of 10,000 VCMM simulations for 30-year annualized nominal returns as of December 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020, in USD.\\n\\nFurther, Figure 1, above, shows that substantially higher annual spending is possible through a flexible approach, calibrated yearly to market conditions (dynamic spending rule).\\nTo help clients in adopting such an approach, it's first helpful to summarize three of the most common spending strategies (Figure 2):\\n\\nDollar plus inflation—The retiree determines a set amount to spend and adds the cost of inflation annually.\\nDynamic spending—The retiree adjusts spending each year to adapt to market conditions. They set a ceiling and floor for how much to take from their portfolio (for instance, 5% greater than the previous year’s spending in exceptional market conditions or 1.5% less than the previous year in a poor market).\\nPercentage of portfolio—The retiree determines a set percentage to spend each year, no matter the size of their portfolio.\\n\\nFigure 2. Comparing spending rules\\n\\nOf the three, dynamic spending offers an appealing combination of overall versatility, flexibility, and stability—allowing retirees to spend more in bull markets while having to cut back only slightly in down markets.\\nDynamic spending also increases the probability of success throughout a wide range of market conditions and at different target spending levels, as demonstrated in the VCMM simulation (Figures 3 and 4). For instance, with a $40,000 spending target, the base case success rate—after a crisis reduced the portfolio to $800,000—was 97.8% using a dynamic spending strategy, versus 88.6% using the dollar plus inflation spending strategy (assuming a time horizon of 30 years after March 2020).\\nFigure 3. Probability of success in times of crisis with $50,000 spending target\\n\\n\\nFigure 4. Probability of success in times of crisis with $40,000 spending target\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the VCMM regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results.

Further, a dynamic spending strategy provides retirees the flexibility to spend more in good market conditions while they only have to cut back a little when markets retreat.\\nNote that the calculations here exclude Social Security and other possible income, such as pensions, rental property, or supplemental employment after retirement. Such income streams can enhance the chances of individuals successfully maintaining their portfolio through the end of retirement.\\nAs a financial advisor, you're uniquely situated to help clients understand sequence-of-return risk, and how implementing a dynamic spending strategy can mitigate that risk. You can also remind them that bearish markets are inevitable. While it's impossible to accurately predict when downturns will appear, with your help, clients can take steps ahead of time to minimize the long-term impact on their retirement.\\nConsult the resources below to explore this topic in greater depth.\"},\n",

Here are five lessons to share with your clients.\\nDevelop a financial game plan\\nFirst, establish clear, attainable goals and create a plan that will help you reach them. Be conservative in your projections about how fast your money will grow. By avoiding impractical saving or spending requirements, you can help keep your plan on track.\\nBecome a disciplined saver\\nFour key words for building a secure financial future are \"live below your means.\" Make a habit of putting money away. If saving money doesn\\'t come naturally to you, find creative ways to make it a fun challenge. Consider what changes you\\'re willing to make to set aside a little more for your future.\\nInvest with balance and diversification\\nCreate a sound investment strategy by choosing an asset allocation that uses broadly diversified funds and considers your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.\\nControl your costs\\nWhile you can\\'t control the markets, you can control your investment costs and taxes. The less you pay for funds, the greater your share of the investments\\' potential returns. Be sure to avoid funds with high expense ratios. The average Vanguard mutual fund and ETF expense ratio is 83% less than the industry average.*\\nTo minimize taxes, consider tax-efficient investments like index mutual funds and ETFs. IRAs are another way to mitigate the impact of taxes.**\\nMaintain a long-term perspective\\nOver time, you’ll experience both good and challenging times that can evoke various emotions.

       "  'content': \"The yield of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose more than 100 basis points (1 percentage point) from August 2020 through late March 2021. Rates also climbed for other government bonds, including those issued by the United Kingdom and Australia. Because bond prices fall as rates rise, and vice versa, some investors are feeling jittery about the near-term risks of bonds.\\nRising bond yields mean lower bond prices\\nDaily yield of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, January 2, 2020–March 22, 2021\\nSource: U.S. Department of the Treasury.\\n\\nBond investors should hold, not fold\\nIn such market cycles, it's particularly important to keep in mind the role bonds play in a diversified investment portfolio—to be a shock absorber at times when equity prices head downward.\\nVanguard research found that when stocks worldwide sank an average of roughly 34% during the global financial crisis, the market for investment-grade bonds returned more than 8%. Similarly, from January through March 2020—the period encompassing the height of volatility in equities due to the COVID-19 pandemic—bonds worldwide returned just over 1% while equities fell by almost 16%. And if we look at the markets over several full business cycles, from January 1988 through November 2020, whenever monthly equity returns were down, monthly bond returns remained positive about 71% of the time.1 \\nSuch uncorrelated returns demonstrate the diversification benefits that a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds offers investors.\\nIn short, don't let changes in interest rates drive a strategic shift in your bond allocation. Myths and misconceptions regarding bond investing abound during periods of rising rates, often coupled with calls for drastic changes to your portfolio. Here are three common myths that investors should avoid:\\nMyth #1: Bonds are a bad idea—abandon the 60/40 portfolio.\\nThis oft-heard recommendation contradicts the overriding importance of maintaining a balanced allocation that suits your investment objectives, plus it may be too late to gain any benefit from a tactical shift in your asset allocation. Selling bonds after the recent increase in rates, which has driven down prices and total returns, is simply chasing past performance. Investors should stay forward-looking: At current higher yields, the outlook for bonds is actually better than before yields went up. Bear in mind that the upside of higher yields—greater interest income—is coming. Also, the odds of future capital losses decline as yields increase. So now is not the time to abandon bond allocations. On the contrary, the more that bond yields rise (and prices fall), the more important it is for long-term investors to maintain a strategic allocation to bonds, which could require rebalancing into bonds, not the other way around.\\nMyth #2: Go to cash—avoid duration risk.\\nRising rates have hit long-term bonds the hardest. But the recommendation to avoid duration or interest rate risk is backward-looking and probably comes too late. Again, shift your mindset to a forward-looking view of the bond market. The market consensus is that rates will rise, and the prices of short-, intermediate-, and long-term issues already reflect that belief. Today's market prices for longer-term bonds already factor in investors' expectations for rising rates, which is why prices are cheaper. If that consensus view were to play out, there would be no advantage in shifting to shorter-term bonds or going to cash. Such moves would pay off only if longer-term yields were to rise more than expected. However, it's equally likely that yields will rise less than expected, in which case long-term bonds would do better.\\nMyth #3: When interest rates are rising, don't just stand there—do something!\\nThe past stretch of rising rates was a surprise to the markets, but now markets expect continued increases. That rates are rising is not really news anymore. While yields indeed seem likely to rise, they may do so by either more or less than the market consensus. Control what you can: With a 50-50 chance of rates rising more or less than consensus, a better approach than trying to pick which market segments will fare best in the near term is to stay well-diversified for the long term across the maturity spectrum and across asset classes.\\nKeep your eyes on the road ahead\\nIt's good advice in both driving and investing. Vanguard recommends that investors stay focused on long-term, forward-looking return expectations, not on recent trailing-return performance.\\nLet your investment goals shape decisions about your strategic asset allocation. Calibrate the risk–return trade-off in your portfolio accordingly, including setting the right mix of bonds and stocks to meet those goals. And generally ignore market-timing advice, which is mostly based on public consensus information that is already priced into the markets.\\nEven if rates keep rising, long-term total returns on broadly diversified bond portfolios are likely to remain positive. That would be the natural outcome of reinvesting bond dividends at higher yields, a process that’s easily managed by owning mutual funds or ETFs.\\nThe elephant in the room—inflation\\nInflation is often seen as the enemy of the fixed income investor—in particular, unexpected inflation that the market hasn't priced in. Inflation-indexed securities provide a limited hedge against unexpected inflation.\\nVanguard research suggests that significant inflation hedging through inflation-linked securities requires large positions, which could reduce the other diversification benefits of a bond allocation in a portfolio. Over long time horizons, equities historically have provided the strongest safeguard against inflation.2\\nWhere active can shine\\nA rising rate environment also accentuates what skilled active managers may be able to bring to a bond portfolio. When yields are falling, outperforming fund managers pile their excess returns on top of the market’s generally rising prices. But amid the headwinds of rising rates and prevailing price declines, successful active fund managers may make the difference between positive and negative total returns.\\nInvestors who are inclined to seek outperformance—and are cognizant of the risk of underperformance—should leave decisions about tactical shifts and security selection to professional active managers. Those managers who have shown skill in executing repeatable investment processes, subject to strict investment risk controls—like my colleagues in Vanguard Fixed Income Group—can guide portfolios successfully through market waters, tranquil and choppy alike.3\"},\n",

How the Fed uses its discretion in achieving these goals, as well as in defining them, is at the heart of its policy decisions—and it's why Vanguard believes the Fed is unlikely to raise rates in the near term.\\nThe Fed has outlined changes to its monetary policy framework that give us confidence that it won't raise its benchmark federal funds rate target until at least 2023, even as stimulus payments flow through the economy and stock markets remain near record highs. On Wednesday, March 17, the Fed reaffirmed that it would keep monetary policy accommodative for the foreseeable future to support economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. It said it would keep its rate target near zero and continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities by a total of at least $120 billion per month for now.\\nIn this Q&A, Vanguard economists Andrew Patterson and Adam Schickling discuss the conditions driving the Fed's decision-making, including its 2020 move to an average inflation target and Chairman Jerome Powell's view that maximum sustainable employment means people in historically hard-to-reach pockets of the labor market getting back to work.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The tremendous surge in the price of cryptocurrencies has attracted the attention of many investors, who may be considering the digital currency as a potential substitute for traditional asset classes in diversified portfolios. But Roger Aliaga-Díaz, chief economist for the Americas and head of portfolio construction at Vanguard, cautioned against speculating in cryptocurrencies, which are largely unregulated and accompanied by considerable risks.\\n\"Cryptocurrency prices depend mostly on speculation about their adoption and use,\" Aliaga-Díaz said. \"And that speculation creates volatility that, ironically, undermines their potential use as either a currency or asset class in an investment strategy.\"\\nWhat is a cryptocurrency?\\nA cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual means of exchange. There are more than 6,700 cryptocurrencies today; among the better known are Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, and Litecoin.\\nUnlike traditional currencies, virtual currencies currently operate without central authorities or banks, and they are not backed by any government. Cryptocurrencies are stored in \"digital wallets\" on a holder\\'s computer or phone, or in the cloud. The wallet serves as a virtual bank account that enables holders to pay for goods and services or simply store the currency in hopes of an increase in value.\\nCryptocurrencies defy neat categorization. They are not a traditional currency, commodity, or asset class, though they share characteristics of each.\\nThere are several reasons why cryptocurrencies are not a traditional currency. Although some merchants have begun to allow cryptocurrency payments, they are generally not accepted as a medium of payment. Cryptocurrencies also are not used as a unit of account because prices, trade invoicing, and contracts are not quoted in digital currency units. Finally, cryptocurrencies\\' ability to serve as a store of value—a safe instrument to preserve the value of people’s financial wealth—is severely limited by their notorious volatility.\\n\"The fact that cryptocurrencies are not issued by a central bank is actually the very reason why they can\\'t achieve the quality of other well-accepted currencies,\" Aliaga-Díaz explained. \"The role of a central bank is precisely to preserve the value of the currency by keeping inflation under control. That\\'s why prices are more predictable under Federal Reserve management of the U.S. dollar money supply.\"\\nCryptocurrencies share some characteristics of commodities. For example, they can be bought and sold in cash markets or via derivatives. But Aliaga-Díaz said they are not commodities because they are not physical raw materials.\\nNo substitute for stock and bonds\\nSome wonder whether cryptocurrencies can be used in strategic portfolios as substitutes for stocks and bonds. \"But unlike traditional asset classes, cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic economic value and generate no cash flows, such as interest payments or dividends, which can explain their prices,\" Aliaga-Díaz said.\\nAliaga-Díaz pointed out that as with currencies and spot commodities, such as gold, there is no risk premium expected with cryptocurrencies as compensation for bearing the risk of their price movements. \"Because cryptos represent uncompensated risk to the portfolio, they are not a good substitute for stocks and bonds in a long-term portfolio,\" he said.\\nSome investors may be willing to bet on sustained crypto price increases based on the belief that crypto demand will always outpace its supply. And though there might be some valid reasons around projected demand and usage to make a compelling case for a persistent supply shortage that can sustain increasing prices, Aliaga-Díaz noted, the supply of cryptos has exploded over time, and there is no reason to believe that supply can\\'t keep up with demand.\\n\"The biggest risk for all investors would be to assume that demand growth will continue just because their prices have recently gone up,\" he said. \"That\\'s speculation, not investment.\"\\nOther risks to keep in mind\\nDespite all the recent attention devoted to cryptocurrencies, Aliaga-Díaz cautioned that there are a number of additional risks associated with digital currencies, including:\\n\\nLiquidity risk. Cryptocurrencies are unregulated, and no party is required to accept payments in virtual currency. As a result, certain market conditions might make it difficult or impossible to sell quickly at a reasonable price.\\nPricing risk. Cryptocurrencies trade in decentralized markets. In addition, cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms do not feature the regulations, controls, and investor protections available in traditional stock, options, and futures markets. For these reasons, there is no unifying single pricing mechanism that reflects digital currency values.\\nRegulatory risk. Cryptocurrencies essentially compete with currencies issued by governments. At some point, governments may seek to regulate or restrict cryptocurrencies, or issue a digital version of their own currencies. Such developments could adversely affect cryptocurrency prices.\\n\\n\"There is no enduring economic or investment rationale to expect cryptocurrencies to generate positive real returns,\" Aliaga-Díaz said. \"For investors, adding exposure to cryptocurrencies would mean reducing allocations to traditional asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a prudent, well-balanced investment program.\"'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Key takeaways\\n\\nThe substantial factor premia documented over long periods of time have been historically realized over a small number of periods when outsized positive returns appeared in clusters. Typically, in these periods, market leadership changed as a bull market transitioned to a bear market, or vice versa.\\nMaintaining a consistent factor exposure by having the flexibility to rebalance on a daily basis—instead of monthly or bi-annually like an indexed fund—would have delivered significantly higher factor premia, effectively doubling the historically observed premia in many cases. In particular, when daily rebalancing led to notable outperformances, the targeted factor\\'s composition changed at a significantly faster pace than in normal times.\\nOur findings indicate that harvesting factor premia to their maximal potential requires a skilled fund manager, who is dedicated and able to tell the right moments to aggressively rebalance from the other times.\\n\\nVanguard\\'s leading expert on factor investing, Antonio Picca and his team, recently researched the optimal rebalancing mechanism for long-only factor funds.\\nThe findings may surprise some as it shows that, based on the last 30 years of factor-investing performances, factor funds that maintained a consistent factor exposure by rebalancing more frequently—on a daily basis instead of monthly or biannually—achieved significantly higher factor premiums, effectively doubling the historically observed premiums of many factors.\\nWhat\\'s more, these findings indicate that to harvest factor premiums to their maximal potential, skill is needed on the part of the fund manager—an ability to tell the right moment to aggressively rebalance.\\nWe asked Antonio Picca four key questions about this body of research.\\nIs factor investing active or passive?\\nIt depends on who you ask. Gene Fama, for example, will tell you that factor investing is a purely passive endeavor. Whereas quantitative managers will tell you that it is a form of active investing. The truth is that factor investing straddles active and passive management.\\nEffective factor strategies seek to deliver a targeted factor exposure. To achieve this, they run a significant active risk against a market capitalization weighted benchmark, and frequently experience persistent out- or underperformances.\\nDespite this, people have grown to think of factor strategies as passive because the marketplace has been dominated by passive funds that are often anchored to a \"factor index\" that rebalances at most a few times in a given year. Beneath this passive façade, however, all factor funds are fundamentally active at their core.\\nUsing the analogy of thrill seeking adventures, we observe that factor investing is akin to surfing; a high-skill adventure. To achieve higher factor premia, factor investing requires active monitoring of the market environment, patience to wait until the wave of out-sized returns finally arrives, and most importantly, the ability to decisively catch the wave to ride it from start to finish.\\nBased on your research, what is the optimal rebalancing mechanism for long-only factor funds?\\nIn our research, we compared three portfolios tracking the same factor \"index\" but rebalancing at different frequencies: daily, monthly, and biannually. The daily-rebalanced portfolio maintained a consistent exposure to the factor, while the other portfolios experienced exposure decay like indexed factor funds.\\nWe found that maintaining a consistent exposure by rebalancing daily leads to much higher excess returns compared to portfolios that rebalance monthly or biannually. We also showed that the efficacy of daily rebalancing is highly time varying, and a significant amount of the outperformance was observed during periods of changing market leadership; when a bull market transitioned to a bear market or vice versa. This means that managers might not want to always rebalance daily, but having the flexibility to do so is a great advantage.\\nOur results are robust across factors with different levels of turnover: momentum, value, quality, and a multi-factor portfolio that equally weights the three aforementioned factors. Momentum is a fast-moving factor because it is affected by short-term returns. Quality, on the other side, only moves when companies report their financial statements. We chose these factors because they represent the set of factors that has become commonly available in the factor fund marketplace. In addition, all single factors we considered have undergone years of extensive research in the academic and practitioner literature. A process that consolidated insights into why the factor premium existed in the past and may persist into the future.\\nCan you share the data that supports your findings?\\nSure. The figure below illustrates the returns of four separate long-only portfolios: momentum, value, quality and multi-factor. The returns reflect conservative, transaction-cost assumptions that are doubled during high-volatility periods like the dot-com bubble bust and the global financial crisis (GFC).\\nFor each portfolio, we looked at the entire sample from January 1990 to August 2019, as well as three sub-periods covering the dot-com bubble, the GFC, and all other years that exclude the GFC and dot-com bubble. The excess returns created by daily rebalancing versus monthly rebalancing is noted in light blue. Whereas the excess returns created by daily rebalancing versus bi-annual rebalancing is noted in dark blue.\\nBy breaking the returns down in this way we can clearly see that maintaining a consistent factor exposure by having the flexibility to rebalance daily provides excess returns over nearly all periods when compared to a fixed monthly or bi-annual rebalancing.\\nThe most significant excess returns were created during the dot-com and GFC periods when the markets transitioned from one cycle to the next.\\nDaily rebalancing outperforms monthly and bi-annually rebalanced portfolios\\nD-M = Daily versus monthly rebalancing\\nD-B = Daily versus bi-annual rebalancing\\nMomentum\\n\\n\\nValue\\n\\n\\nQuality\\n\\n\\nMultifactor\\nSource: Vanguard. The portfolios were constructed using U.S. equity universe data underlying Axioma\\'s Risk Model AXUS4 (Axioma). This universe of securities largely overlaps with Russell 3000. The three single-factor portfolios were equally weighted the top 30% of securities by factor score as determined by Axioma. The multi-factor fund was constructed first by averaging the factor scores of momentum, value, and quality at the individual security level, which creates a cross section of composite multifactor scores. Based on this composite score, we then selected the top 30% of securities and equal weighted them. The portfolios tracked the same signal portfolio by rebalancing daily, monthly, and biannually, 30 bps per transaction volume for all trading; in addition, for extended periods with elevated volatility—notably around the dot-com bust (1999–2004) and the great financial crisis (2008–2009)—we double the trading cost assumption to 60 bps per transaction volume.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\nWhat portfolio manager characteristics should advisors look for when selecting factor funds?\\nThe concept of factors is simple. However, factor investing is not easy because factor returns can be quite volatile over short periods of time and can go through long stretches of underperformance. Successful factor managers should be able to maintain a strong and consistent factor exposure over time.\\nA strong factor exposure requires conviction and the willingness to run significant active risk against the market. Maintaining consistent exposure requires not only patience—to wait until the factor is in action—but also well-timed agility to follow the signal aggressively when the return environment does present itself.\\nGoing back to the surfing analogy, a skillful factor manager is like a master surfer who waits for the big wave. Even though it requires a whole lot of dedication, the surfer endures the passing of time patiently waiting for the big wave to appear. However, if and when the big wave does appear, how this surfer has prepared for this once-in-a-decade opportunity will be fully on display.\\nA well-prepared master surfer will ride the wave from start to finish, whereas others may wait on the side line for too long and catch only the tail end of the wave; a wave that may not return for another decade.Notes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs, obtain a prospectus (or summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-523-1036 to request one.

But our aim is to measure manager skill, independent of expenses beyond annual management fees. That’s why we calculate returns before any 12b-1 fees are deducted. Similarly, fund loads, or sales charges, aren’t included in our calculation of returns.\\nEach fund’s performance is measured against all of the other funds in its Refinitiv Lipper category, with a percentile ranking of 100 being the highest and 1 the lowest. This result is then weighted by asset size relative to the fund family’s other assets in its general classification. If a family’s biggest funds do well, that boosts its overall showing; poor performance in its biggest funds hurts a firm’s ranking.\\nTo be included in the ranking, a firm must have at least three funds in the general equity category, one world equity, one mixed equity (such as a balanced or target-date fund), two taxable bond funds, and one national tax-exempt bond fund.\\nSingle-sector and single-country equity funds are factored into the rankings as general equity. We exclude all passive index funds, including pure index, enhanced index, and index-based, but includes actively managed ETFs and so-called smart-beta ETFs, which are passively managed but created from active strategies.\\nFinally, the score is multiplied by the weighting of its general classification, as determined by the entire Lipper universe of funds. The category weightings for the one-year results in 2020 were general equity, 35.6%; mixed asset, 20.7%; world equity, 17.3%; taxable bond, 21.9%; and tax-exempt bond, 4.8%.\\nThe category weightings for the five-year results were general equity, 36.2%; mixed asset, 20.9%; world equity, 16.9%; taxable bond, 21.6%; and tax-exempt bond, 4.4%. For the 10-year list, they were general equity, 37.5%; mixed asset, 19.5%; world equity, 17.3%; taxable bond, 20.8%; and tax-exempt bond, 4.8%.\\nThe scoring: Say a fund in the general U.S. equity category has $500 million in assets, accounting for half of the firm’s assets in that category, and its performance lands it in the 75th percentile for the category. The first calculation would be 75 times 0.5, which comes to 37.5. This score is then multiplied by 35.6%, general equity’s overall weighting in Lipper’s universe, or 37.5 times 0.356, which equals 13.35. Similar calculations are done for each fund in our study. The numbers are added for each category and overall. The shop with the highest total score wins. The same process is repeated to determine the 5- and 10-year rankings.\\n1 Vanguard, as of December 31, 2020.\\n2 Vanguard and Morningstar, Inc., as of December 31, 2020.\\n3 The performance of Vanguard’s active funds relative to their peer-group averages follows: For the 10-year period, 7 of 7 Vanguard money market funds, 38 of 44 bond funds, 6 of 6 balanced funds, and 30 of 37 stock funds, or 81 of 94 Vanguard funds outperformed their peer-group averages.

       "  'content': 'With the proliferation of low-cost passive and factor-based products, how can advisors evaluate whether a particular active bond manager is worth the extra cost?\\nVanguard\\'s latest research paper answers this question with a systematic five-step process.\\n\"We tried to bridge the gap between theory and practical application,\" said Inna Zorina, senior investment strategist in Vanguard Investment Strategy Group and coauthor of Can active fixed income managers be cloned using style funds? A practical testing method. \"Our model used combinations of existing bond ETFs to simulate the performance of 625 actively managed U.S. fixed income funds that existed during the five years through 2019.\"\\nThe results indicated that while there are some active fixed income managers providing true alpha, there is a sizable portion who could be replicated with lower-fee passive style (i.e., factor) products. We asked the authors to apply the same methodology to one of Vanguard\\'s newer and popular active funds to see where it falls within this framework.\\nBut first, here are the findings of the overall study:\\nMore than one-fifth of active managers could have been cloned\\nThe chart below shows where the active managers landed in terms of net alpha relative to a proxy portfolio of ETFs that simulated their performance (horizontal axis) and tracking error relative to that proxy (vertical axis).\\nThose managers in the upper two quadrants had a tracking error greater than 1.5%, meaning that they were not easy to replicate with a proxy portfolio, while those in the upper- and lower-right quadrants added alpha that exceeded the average weighted expense ratio for the proxy portfolios. The left two quadrants are where active managers do not want to land, as these managers underperformed the proxies.\\nAlpha and replicability of active bond funds\\nNote: The chart illustrates individual U.S.-domiciled funds investing in U.S. fixed income. The tracking error and alpha values are calculated versus the given manager\\'s factor-mimicking portfolio. The factors used in the analysis included the total U.S. market, high-yield credit, and ultrashort Treasuries acting as a cash term. Average cost of cloning is estimated to be 20 basis points (0.20%), which represents the weighted expense ratio of the factor proxy products of an average factor-mimicking portfolio. Alpha could result from model misspecification (such as a suboptimal choice of factor proxies or omitted factors). Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.\\nSource: Can active fixed income managers be cloned using style funds? A practical testing method. Vanguard calculations using monthly gross return data from Morningstar for the five years through December 31, 2019.\\n\\n\"Roughly 22% of the funds fell in the lower-left quadrant,\" said Zorina. \"We deemed those to be \\'likely cloneable.\\' Their performance can be mostly replicated with passive products, and they didn\\'t deliver enough alpha to offset the cost. On the other hand, some funds fell in the lower-right quadrant, offering similar factor profile and greater alpha relative to their respective factor-mimicking portfolios.\"\\nInvestors should also consider other factors that will contribute to the fund\\'s ability to achieve better long-term results, including lower fees, long-term perspective, a keen focus on risk optimization and downside protection, and exposure to diversified sources of alpha.\\nVanguard Core Bond Fund: True-to-label alpha\\nThe paper\\'s authors applied the same methodology to gauge the \"cloneability\" of Vanguard Core Bond Fund. (The fund was launched March 28, 2016, so it was not part of the original study, which counted only funds with five-year track records through 2019.)\\nA combination of two bond ETFs—one a total market product and the other tracking an intermediate-term corporate credit benchmark—came close to simulating the fund\\'s return profile since inception though year-end 2020.\\nThe chart below shows that the weighting between the two proxy products had to change over time to mimic the fund\\'s performance. The weighting averaged around 91% for the market and 9% for intermediate-term credit.\\nProportional changes in factors to mimic Vanguard Core Bond Fund\\'s returns\\nNote: The graph illustrates a 36-month rolling window of the factor exposure of Vanguard Core Bond Investor. The varying proportion represents the optimal combination of market and corporate intermediate benchmarks to replicate Vanguard Core Bond Fund\\'s returns as closely as possible. The factor portfolios assumed monthly rebalancing and no transaction costs for rebalancing.\\nSource: Can active fixed income managers be cloned using style funds? A practical testing method. Vanguard calculations using data from Morningstar Direct from April 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020.\\n\\nThe regression analysis revealed that the tracking error was 0.50% and the adjusted R-squared was 0.98, meaning that the factor-mimicking portfolio tracked the Core Bond Fund’s returns very closely. Portfolio weights of both market and intermediate-term credit were statistically significant at 1%.\\nHowever, the Core Bond Fund delivered a gross alpha of 63 basis points relative to the proxy portfolio—63 bps generated from security selection and other alpha sources that could not be delivered by the proxies. This amount of alpha is significant for fixed income, particularly for a fund whose mandate is to keep a risk profile similar to the broad investment-grade bond market, putting it in the lower-right quadrant of the chart shown earlier.\\nTaking into account the 10 bps expense ratio of the fund\\'s Admiral Shares, the fund delivered 53 bps of net alpha (or 57 bps if you factor in the 4 bps expense ratio of the proxy portfolio).\\n\"During the research and design process before the fund\\'s launch, the Vanguard Fixed Income Group said it would expect the fund to have a slight credit tilt on average over time,\" Zorina said.\\n\"As per our analysis, the fund delivered returns equivalent to a mix of roughly 90% market and 10% intermediate-term credit while still providing alpha.

       "  'content': 'There\\'s only one sure way to identify an asset bubble, and that\\'s after the bubble has burst. Until then, a fast-appreciating asset may seem overvalued, only for its price to keep rising. Anyone who has tried to breathe one last breath into a balloon and finds it can accommodate two or three more breaths can relate.\\nYale University\\'s William Goetzmann learned just how hard it can be to pinpoint a bubble. He found that assets whose prices more than double over one to three years are twice as likely to double again in the same time frame as they are to lose more than half their value.1\\nVanguard believes that a bubble is an instance of prices far exceeding an asset\\'s fundamental value, to the point that no plausible future income scenario can justify the price, which ultimately corrects. Our view is informed by academic research dating from the start of this century, before the dot-com bubble burst.\\nAre there asset bubbles out there now? We at Vanguard have great respect for the uncertainty of the future, so the best we can say is \"maybe.\" Some specific markets, such as U.S. housing and cryptocurrencies, seem particularly frothy. U.S. home prices rose 10.4% year-over-year in December 2020, their biggest jump since recovering from the global financial crisis.2 But pandemic-era supply-and-demand dynamics, rather than speculative excess, are likely driving the rise.\\nCryptocurrencies, on the other hand, have soared more than 500% in the last year.3 It\\'s a curious rise for an asset that is not designed to produce cash flows and whose price trajectory seems like that of large-capitalization growth stocks—the opposite of what one would expect from an asset meant to hedge against inflation and currency depreciation. Rational people can disagree over cryptocurrencies\\' inherent value, but such discussions today might have to include talk of bubbles.\\nWhat about U.S. stocks? The broad market may be overvalued, though not severely. Yet, forthcoming Vanguard research highlights one part of the U.S. equity market that gives us pause: growth stocks. Low-quality growth stocks especially test our \"plausible future income\" scenario. For some high-profile companies, valuation metrics imply that their worth will exceed the size of their industry\\'s contribution to U.S. GDP. Conversely, our research will show that U.S. value stocks are similarly undervalued.\\nLow-quality growth has outperformed the broad market\\nNotes: Data as of December 31, 2020. Portfolios are indexed to 100 as of December 31, 2010. Low-quality growth and high-quality value portfolios are constructed based on data from Kenneth R. French\\'s website, using New York Stock Exchange-listed companies sorted in quintiles by operating profit and the ratio of book value to market value (B/P). The low-quality growth portfolio is represented by the lowest quintile operating profit (quality) and B/P companies. The high-quality value portfolio is represented by the highest quintile operating profit and B/P companies. The broad U.S. stock market is represented by the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index (formerly known as the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000) through April 22, 2005; the MSCI US Broad Market Index through June 2, 2013; and the CRSP US Total Market Index thereafter.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from Ken French\\'s website at Dartmouth College, mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html; MSCI; CRSP; and Dow Jones.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\nLow-quality growth stocks—companies with little to no operating profits—have outperformed the broad market by 5.5 percentage points per year over the last decade. Of course, there are reasons why growth stocks may be richly valued compared with the broad market. Growth stocks, by definition, are those anticipated to grow more quickly than the overall market. Their appeal is in their potential. But the more that their share prices rise, the less probable that they can justify those higher prices. A small handful of these \"low-quality growth\" companies may become the Next Big Thing. But many more may fade into obscurity, as occurred after the dot-com bubble.\\nThe market for initial public offerings offers some insights (with my thanks to colleagues in Vanguard Quantitative Equity Group). Four out of five companies that offered shares on public markets for the first time in 2020 had earnings per share below zero. The percentage of such unprofitable IPOs has been nearly as high for the last several years, comparable to the numbers seen in the years leading up to the dot-com bubble. Such dynamics could create the catalyst for a hard landing for growth stocks. Of the unprofitable IPOs in 2020, more than 80% were in the technology and biotech sectors.4\\nUnprofitable IPOs are reminiscent of the dot-com bubble\\nNotes: As of December 31, 2020.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, using data from Jay R. Ritter\\'s website at the University of Florida, site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/ipo-data/, excluding American Depositary Receipts, natural-resource limited partnerships and trusts, closed-end funds, real estate investment trusts, special purpose acquisitions companies, banks and savings and loans, unit offers, penny stocks (with an offer price of less than $5 per share), and stocks not listed on the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange for all IPOs.\\n\\nValue stocks, by contrast, trade at prices below what company fundamentals suggest are reasonable. These steady companies seem to have been around forever and are likely to stay around. High-quality value stocks have underperformed the broad market by 15.5 percentage points per year over the last decade.\\nWe don\\'t expect the trends that defined the last decade to persist\\nAs we outlined in the Vanguard Economic and Market Outlook for 2021: Approaching the dawn, we expect equity markets outside the United States to outperform U.S. equities and expect value stocks to outperform growth. Our forthcoming fundamental assessment of growth and value stocks underscores our beliefs.\\nPerformance variation between investing styles and sectors is among the reasons Vanguard believes that investors should hold broadly diversified portfolios, as highlighted in Vanguard’s Principles for Investing Success (PDF). Those who do so benefit from a natural rebalancing that occurs over time as market segments outperform and underperform.\\nHowever, investors with conviction in their assessment of the markets, the time horizon to be patient, and the discipline to hold firm amid volatility may benefit from an overweight allocation to value stocks commensurate with their risk tolerance. Such a tilt could help offset the lower broad-market returns we expect in the decade ahead compared with the decade past.\\nWe appreciate that fast-rising assets may grow richer still. But, at some point, the markets will be faced with a question related to our definition of asset bubbles: What plausible future income scenario justifies an asset’s price? We expect that valuations eventually will reflect companies’ true probability of profitability, especially in the most-stretched corners of the market.\\nI’d like to thank Ian Kresnak, CFA, and my colleagues in Vanguard Quantitative Equity Group for their invaluable contributions to this commentary.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Goetzmann, William N., 2016.

       "  'content': 'When it became clear early in 2020 that the COVID-19 pandemic stood to convulse the global economy, central banks acted swiftly, slashing interest rates to near zero and establishing programs to buy government and corporate bonds by the hundreds of billions of dollars, euros, and pounds.\\xa0\\nNow, amid hope that vaccines will drive immunity and enliven economic activity this year, investors are starting to wonder what comes next. What happens when a \"whatever it takes\" approach to fiscal and monetary policy gives way to an unwinding of bold actions?\\n\\'We\\'re still very much in the middle\\' of the pandemic\\nInvestors should remind themselves that much of the world remains firmly in the pandemic\\'s grip—from both human and economic perspectives—and that the policy response stands to remain supportive in the months ahead.\\n\"We\\'re still very much in the middle of this,\" said Josh Hirt, a U.S.-based Vanguard senior economist. \"It may feel less like an emergency now, and we think we have a better understanding of an eventual end point thanks to vaccine developments. But the trajectory of the economy still very much depends on health outcomes.\"\\nThe idea, Hirt said, is to limit \"scarring,\" providing enough support so that reduced economic activity doesn’t turn into insolvencies, and temporary job losses don\\'t become permanent.\\nFiscal and monetary support has been unprecedented\\nNotes: Change in fiscal policy is represented by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance from 2019 through September 30, 2020.\\nSources: Vanguard, U.S. Congressional Budget Office, Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and International Monetary Fund, as of September 30, 2020.\\n\\nThe United States passed the $2.2 trillion CARES Act in March 2020 and a further $900 billion relief package in December and is considering further fiscal support. The U.S. Federal Reserve has committed to indefinite purchases of U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities totaling at least $120 billion per month.\\nThe similarly accommodative European Central Bank expanded its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme in December to a total of €1.85 trillion (USD 2.25 trillion) and extended its purchase window through at least March 2022. On the fiscal side, most European governments have run large deficits over the last year to support jobs and businesses. The €750 billion (USD 910 billion) Next Generation EU pandemic recovery program begins disbursements this year.\\nMeanwhile, China—where the pandemic originated—is widely viewed as having controlled the virus effectively. Its fiscal and monetary support was modest compared with other large economies, and its economy registered growth for full-year 2020.\\n\"Life was largely back to normal in the middle of last year in China,\" said Alexis Gray, a Melbourne-based Vanguard senior economist. \"People were going back to offices, and restaurants and cinemas were open. There have been some regionalized outbreaks, but those have so far been squashed. So if you look on a national level, life is for the most part normal, which is obviously very different to what we\\'re seeing in the United States and in Europe.\"\\nEasy monetary policy means easy borrowing terms\\nNote: The forecast represents 3.5% nominal GDP growth, an average debt interest cost of 1.2%, and a 2.5% budget deficit.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from Refinitiv and the International Monetary Fund, as of September 30, 2020.\\n\\nThe confluence of fiscal support and accommodative monetary policy isn\\'t coincidental, said Shaan Raithatha, a London-based Vanguard economist: \"Emergency quantitative easing programs have helped financial conditions remain easy. This, in turn, has allowed governments to borrow large amounts of debt in a more sustainable way.\"\\nWith COVID-19 still raging, Raithatha doesn\\'t foresee monetary policy normalizing for at least the next 12 months. In Europe, he said, the risks are actually skewed toward further acceleration of quantitative easing purchases in the short term amid tighter virus-containment restrictions.\\nThe low-interest-rate environment should help governments avoid the sorts of restrictive austerity measures that prolonged recovery from the global financial crisis, most notably in Europe. Government borrowing to finance the recovery from the pandemic is locked in at today\\'s ultralow rates, Raithatha noted.\\n\"As long as nominal GDP growth rates exceed the nominal cost of debt and budget deficits start to normalize from their current exceptional levels, which you\\'d expect once the threat from COVID-19 has passed, government debt-to-GDP ratios are likely to gradually fall over time,\" he said.\\nVanguard\\'s chief economist for the Americas, Roger Aliaga-Díaz, explained the fiscal math behind debt sustainability in a June 2020 article.\\nHow will investors react to a bump in inflation?\\nAlthough the fight against the pandemic remains front and center, ever-forward-looking investors have begun to fret about the timing and implications of an unwinding of support—something that the Federal Reserve said on January 27 was premature to consider. Here again, recovery from the global financial crisis holds the power to inform. In what became known as the \"Taper Tantrum,\" U.S. Treasury yields spiked upon news, in 2013, that the Fed would trim asset purchases. This time, the Fed emphasizes that eventual scaling back of asset purchases will be clearly signaled well in advance.\\nReversal of quantitative easing is a logical first step toward policy normalization, for which the benchmark interest rate is the primary lever. Investors\\' underlying fear is that inflation could drive rates higher—and a test may lie ahead. \"We anticipate a decent bump above 2% inflation in the United States sometime in the middle of the year,\" Hirt said. \"What does this do to investor psychology?\"\\nVanguard believes that this bump will be transitory, in part because of base effects, or low year-earlier comparisons, and that structural forces will keep full-year U.S. inflation below the Fed\\'s 2% target. It should be noted, too, that the Fed in 2020 adopted an \"average inflation targeting\" strategy, allowing inflation to exceed its target without fostering a rate hike as long as inflation averaged 2% over time.\\n\"There is a risk for portfolios,\" Hirt said, \"that in a well-supported policy environment the eventual vanquishing of the pandemic unleashes strong demand and \\'animal spirits\\' that could influence inflation psychology, pressuring the Fed to act sooner than currently anticipated.\" Such a scenario could engender capital losses in bond portfolios and remove some of the justification for the higher valuations currently supporting equity markets.\\nVanguard doesn\\'t anticipate such a scenario this year. As we note in the Vanguard economic and market outlook for 2021: Approaching the dawn, we see it as unlikely that short-term rates will rise in any major developed market as monetary policy remains highly accommodative. And we see global equities as neither grossly overvalued nor likely to produce outsize returns.\\nAn ever-present risk for investors, meanwhile, can be trying to outsmart the market as to when—and whether—potential scenarios play out. That\\'s why we advocate that investors follow Vanguard\\'s Principles for Investing Success: Set clear investment goals, ensure that portfolios are well-diversified across asset classes and regions, keep investment costs low, and take a long-term view.'},\n",

The first vaccines to emerge from clinical trials proved more effective than even the most optimistic assessments, raising the confidence of public health experts and investors alike, as I wrote late last year.\\nNow, even as infections and hospitalizations remain elevated and new disease variants appear to spread more quickly, we remain confident that the developed world will begin to show meaningful progress against the pandemic in the months ahead.\\nThe essential variable? Vaccine distribution. Despite a slow start, the pace of vaccinations in the United States now exceeds one million per day.1 We’re early in the rollout, and we believe that initial distribution bottlenecks—attributable in no small part to stockpiling scarce supply to ensure second doses—are surmountable. A change in strategy that prioritizes first doses and increased vaccine production should ensure that the pace of vaccinations accelerates.\\nThe path to herd immunity depends on the pace of vaccinations\\nNotes: This analysis, as of January 25, 2021, discounts people who achieve immunity through infection. The gray buffers around the vaccination trend lines reflect the impossibility of precisely predicting when herd immunity may be achieved.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nAs a result, our analysis suggests, the United States can approach herd immunity in the second half of the year, consistent with our view in our Vanguard economic and market outlook for 2021. As our forecast further notes, the timing of when herd immunity is achieved relates directly to our outlook for the global economy. The path of economic recovery hinges critically on health outcomes; we expect to see business and social activity normalize as we approach herd immunity.\\nThe more quickly this occurs, the more quickly we’re likely to see unemployment rates trend downward, inflation move toward central bank targets, and output reach pre-pandemic levels.\\nOur analysis makes several assumptions, and we acknowledge that COVID-19 continues to present many unknowns. Our analysis assumes herd immunity thresholds—the percentage of a population that needs to be immune for herd immunity to kick in—of 66% and 80%. The 66% is a widely discussed COVID-19 threshold. If new strains in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and elsewhere prove more infectious, a more conservative threshold such as 80% may be more appropriate.\\nFinally, our analysis assumes that the vaccines now in use will prove effective against COVID-19 mutations. We know that the virus has mutated several times since its inception, yet vaccines based on its initial genetic sequencing have still proved remarkably effective.\\nThe pandemic has upended the lives of nearly everyone.

I discussed in a recent web article how such work-from-home arrangements represent a sharp acceleration of a trend that was already under way before COVID-19. But the big question for the U.S. economy is how many jobs, and what types, could permanently become remote 100% of the time, even after an effective vaccine is eventually distributed?\\nThe answer could have undeniable effects on workers, employers, and the economy. For example, if tech workers can just as easily do their jobs from home offices in Toledo or Tulsa or Topeka, do Silicon Valley firms need vast California campuses? And what would that mean for businesses that rely on such a concentration of workers and for commuting patterns? What would it mean for real estate prices, both commercial and residential?\\nEvaluating the future of remote work\\nNote: Data as of September 30, 2020.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics O*NET database.\\n\\nOur 2018 Vanguard research paper The Future of Work found that, contrary to some reports, technology isn’t widely causing jobs to disappear, but it is profoundly changing nearly all of them. A job is broadly the sum of its tasks. Our paper examined the 41 work activities, or tasks, that make up the nearly 1,000 occupations tracked by the U.S. Department of Labor and found that, since 2000, tasks have widely shifted from being basic and repetitive toward “uniquely human” tasks that rely on creative problem-solving.\\nIn that study, we focused on the number of jobs needed in the future (answer: more in total), without worrying about where those jobs were located and whether certain ones could be done remotely. But as the graphic above shows, we’ve now done just that. We updated our task framework within the Labor Department’s universe of occupations. Now, though, we’ve scored each occupation’s associated tasks on a scale of 0 to 10 for remote-work potential. A score of 0 represents a task that can’t be accomplished remotely at all, while a 10 represents a task that can be performed entirely remotely with equal effectiveness.\\nWe then looked at which tasks were critically important to a given job. For example, a bartender’s work includes the critically important task of mixing drinks but also the not critically important task of data entry.\\nFinally, we assessed which occupations had a high overall remote score among critically important tasks. We find, as you can see in the graphic, that roughly 15% of all U.S. jobs could be conducted remotely. Although that percentage may sound small, it represents potentially over 20 million U.S. workers. That’s a large number.\\nOur assessment included a conservative threshold of 60% for critically important tasks, meaning that some effectiveness could be “lost” with certain tasks being done remotely, but that 60% effectiveness was good enough to complete the task. A higher threshold would mean that fewer occupations and workers could permanently work remotely.\\nThe first takeaway of our remote-work assessment\\nPerhaps our graphic’s most intriguing feature is the high percentage of occupations in the middle—the dots between all-remote and the pre-pandemic normal. This suggests to me that a hybrid model for the future of work may emerge for many of us, one in which remote work may suffice for days or weeks at a time, but not the entire year. After all, while a job may be the sum of its tasks, a career involves much more. There are many \"uniquely human\" tasks that many occupations share; such as training, mentoring, and collaboration for which fully remote work may pose challenges.\\nIn the Vanguard economic and market outlook 2021: Approaching the dawn, which we’ll publish in December 2020, we’ll further discuss trends that may have been either accelerated (such as remote work) or altered by COVID-19 and assess their economic and market implications.\\nBut our initial read of remote work, using our data-driven framework, suggests that for many of us, the future of work will be like neither the past nor the present. It suggests that, for certain occupations, a hybrid model may emerge that combines the power of social interaction with the flexibility of remote work.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'As the effective October-end deadline draws near for defining the terms of a post-Brexit trade relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, one thing is already perfectly clear: The original vision of a comprehensive free-trade deal has given way to two potential limited outcomes that aren\\'t tremendously different from each other in their likely long-term economic effects.\\nWe\\'ll learn soon whether the parties can strike a deal on a new bare-bones trade relationship to take effect January 1, 2021, or whether they\\'re resigned to a no-deal scenario of tariffs and quotas as defined by the World Trade Organization.\\nEither way, customs checks on cross-border goods will become a fact of life. Deal or no deal will also determine whether those checks occur between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which could have its own longer-term implications beyond trade.\\nWhile important issues remain, some of the more pressing concerns—for example, allowing E.U. financial institutions to keep operating in the U.K. while they work to secure full U.K. authorization—have been allayed.\\nThe implications for markets also hinge on deal versus no deal, with the U.K. currency and stock markets likely to come under pressure in the absence of some sort of deal. But the bulk of the markets\\' response has been baked into prices since that early-summer day more than four years ago when U.K. voters chose their go-it-alone path, and investors would be wise to tune out the market noise that either scenario is likely to generate.\\nDownsides to lack of a trade deal\\nThe economic downsides of no deal exceed those of a bare-bones deal. A no-deal scenario would create, to all intents and purposes, a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (an E.U. member) and would likely bring disruptions in the form of vigorous border checks, queues at ports, and a possible equity market sell-off.\\nYet a bare-bones agreement also would bring change. Like no deal, it would restrict cross-border movement of people between the E.U. and the U.K. And it would create a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. Neither is the case through year end, with the U.K. still operating under E.U. rules.\\nVanguard estimates a bare-bones deal would result in just over a 6% decline in U.K. gross domestic product over the next 10 years, compared with our GDP expectations if the U.K. were able to maintain current E.U. trade rules. No deal would worsen that decline to nearly 8%.\\nLong-run impact of Brexit on U.K. GDP\\nNotes: This figure shows the cumulative impact of Brexit on GDP by 2030. Productivity impact is estimated using a vector error correction model that incorporates a proxy for trade openness and foreign direct investment. Human capital growth is assumed to be unaffected by Brexit. Labor supply is assumed to grow at a similar rate to total population growth.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations based on Macrobond and the U.K. Office of National Statistics.\\n\\nTo be sure, the effects on GDP of either a bare-bones deal or no deal at all will pale in comparison to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. But while the COVID shock may eventually unwind once the crisis abates, the effects of Brexit on U.K. GDP are likely to persist over the next decade and beyond.\\nLack of a trade deal doesn’t have to be forever\\nBrexit was driven in part by the idea of the U.K. being able to strike out on its own and reach better trade deals with other countries. For the most part, this hasn\\'t happened. Yet.\\nThe U.K. has negotiated new trade deals with about half of the non-E.U. countries with which it previously had trade relationships through the E.U. But those countries represent only 18% of the U.K.\\'s trade, and for the most part, these deals broadly replicate the terms of the deals previously in place through the E.U.\\nExpectations for a comprehensive U.K.-E.U. trade agreement similar to the E.U.\\'s agreement with Canada were shredded long before the final grind to \"get Brexit done.\" The Canada agreement, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, took effect in 2017 after more than eight years of negotiation but still hasn’t been signed off on by all E.U. member states. A U.K.-U.S. trade deal has no immediate prospect. An Australia-style deal, which has also been mentioned, is essentially a no-deal option under which Australia-E.U. trade is conducted mostly by World Trade Organization rules.\\nAnd then there\\'s the question about future trade with the E.U., which has less at stake proportionately than the U.K.\\nTrade stakes are greater for U.K.\\nNote: U.K. imports from and exports to the E.U. are a much higher percentage of overall U.K. trade than are E.U. imports from and exports to the U.K.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations based on 2019 data from Macrobond and the U.K. Office of National Statistics.\\n\\nEven if no deal is reached with the E.U. in the short run, it doesn\\'t mean no trade deal permanently. When trying to make trade easier, the one group you want to make sure you trade with as easily as possible is your giant next-door neighbor that accounts for about half of your trade. A bare-bones deal would be a far smoother starting point, however.\\nU.K.-E.U. trade implications for investors\\nAs is often the case when a major market event occurs, investors should expect volatility over the coming months. The specifics of Brexit are difficult to predict, and risk perceptions can change quickly.\\nBut we believe that expectations about Brexit\\'s effect over time on fundamentals such as future profits are largely priced in. So the bar for investors is not whether Brexit will further affect asset prices, but whether you think you have a better view than everyone else about what happens next. That\\'s a very high bar, and it reinforces Vanguard\\'s belief that investors should maintain a balanced portfolio across asset classes and regions in keeping with their well-considered, long-term investment plan.'},\n",

Substantive changes to debt instruments, including replacing a reference rate, can be deemed by the IRS to be a taxable exchange, requiring the holder of the debt instrument to recognize a gain or loss.\\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed regulations that would allow issuers to replace LIBOR with SOFR (as well as certain other \"qualified\" rates), without causing a taxable exchange, so long as the replacement does not significantly change the fair market value of the debt instrument.\\nOnce finalized, these IRS regulations are likely to provide a way for issuers to replace LIBOR in a manner that would cause holders to avoid recognizing a gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\\nVanguard\\'s preparations for the LIBOR transition\\nBecause some Vanguard funds have exposure to LIBOR, we have established a governance program and developed a plan to help us navigate a transition away from that benchmark.

       "  'content': \"The American mathematician Claude Shannon famously established a lower bound for the number of possible moves in a typical chess match: around 10120. That's 10 with 119 zeroes after it. Reflecting on when the COVID-19 crisis began to unfold across the globe, I think the Shannon number adequately captures the breadth of possible economic outcomes at the time.\\nAs the crisis has evolved, however, two things have become clear: pandemic has accelerated some trends already in place, and COVID-19 will have implications that are opaque now but that will become undeniably clear and meaningful over time.\\nThe future accelerated\\nBefore the pandemic sent office staff flocking to home workstations, employers were taking an incremental approach to remote work. Recent improvements in office technologies let them untether workforces on a timetable of their choosing. The pandemic took the decision out of employers' hands.\\nSimilar to how issuers can recall certain bonds when conditions allow them to reissue on more favorable terms, the pandemic functioned as a call option on employers' incrementalism. No longer could work-from-home arrangements serve as controlled experiments in productivity; they became indispensable. Ready or not, employers for the most part have successfully enabled secure and efficient work from home and redefined team dynamics. The office will never be the same. Meanwhile, significantly reduced demand for office square footage, which had grown on a per capita basis for 50 years, stands to redefine our cityscapes and suburban makeups.\\nSimilarly, the pandemic has ground business travel to a halt. Historically the most profitable business for airlines and hotels, such travel has been replaced by video conferences and virtual collaboration tools. Such a development tests airline and hotel business models that rely on less-price-sensitive business travelers to help keep leisure travelers' costs low.\\nCOVID-19 has also accelerated the challenges facing restaurants and brick-and-mortar retailers. E-retail and food delivery, already growing in popularity before the pandemic, have become essential to consumers worried about face-to-face interaction. As with office work and air travel, restaurants and retail may not overcome heightened consumer reluctance until an effective vaccine or treatment is developed—something we're not expecting before 2021. In some cases, the damage could be permanent.\\nInterestingly, changes to commercial real estate, or at least how we invest in it, had already been occurring in plain sight. Over the last decade, office and retail constituents have fallen from 39% to 19% of equity REIT assets, while residential, infrastructure, and data centers—sectors that are likely to benefit from the pandemic—now make up 45%.1\\nPost-pandemic questions\\nAlthough some implications of the post-pandemic world are evident, others, for now, are more opaque:\\n\\nWill massive stimulus, supply-chain disruptions, and pent-up demand give rise to inflation that has eluded developed economies for a decade?\\nIs the globalization trend that has defined the post-World War II era ending, and what would that mean for trade and economic growth?\\nWith interest rates pinned at historic lows and deficits and balance sheets expanding, what can central banks do to support employment and price stability?\\n\\nAnd what becomes of inequality, a statistically significant detractor from a nation's economic health that increased after the 2008 global financial crisis?2 Our current crises (both health and economic) are disproportionately affecting people of certain races and socio-economic groups. Though I'm encouraged by emerging conversations that are both thoughtful and action-oriented, it's not yet clear whether the pandemic will accelerate or reverse the inequality trend.\\nThese questions will demand our attention and continue to act as source material for articles in the months and years ahead. It is likely that answers to some of these questions will materially affect the trajectory of others. In that sense, the number of possible moves left in our chess match still includes a whole lot of zeroes.\\n\\n\\n\\nMarket perspectives: September 2020\\nEconomic growth may slow later in the year, with COVID-19 progression and the prospects for a vaccine remaining the key drivers of economic activity.View article\\n\\n\\n\\nIs there a disconnect between the economy and the markets?\\nVanguard believes that a fundamental reason exists for equity markets having bounced back so far from their pandemic-induced shock.View article\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'Since the remarkable equity market reversal in developed countries in late March, many clients have asked whether markets have become irrational. Given the extreme uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, record unemployment, and eye-watering declines in second-quarter GDP, how can the markets have flirted with all-time highs?\\nPossible answers range from \"there\\'s no alternative\" to young investors\\' driving the market through new digital investor platforms. Our Investment Strategy Group, however, thinks that the answer is fundamental. And we don\\'t believe that U.S. equity markets are acting irrationally.\\nMathematics and value judgments\\nAt their core, financial markets reflect assessments of the value of assets today based on investors\\' expectations for the cash those assets will generate. This concept of net present value is more concretely applied to fixed income, where the known values for yields and coupon payments produce the price. Knowing two of the three values allows investors to determine the third.\\nThe concept applies equally to equity markets. Price plays the same role as in fixed income; future cash flows equate to the coupon, and the required rate of return equates to yield to maturity. The challenge for equities is the inherent uncertainty around future cash flows—the earnings that companies will reinvest in the business or distribute in dividends.\\nMuch of the assessment of these future cash flows is related to current financial conditions. Because of the market\\'s forward-looking nature, prices react to changing corporate and economic conditions faster than traditional economic data can.\\nThree telling events\\nThough COVID-19 remains a real risk to the global economy, three important things happened in recent months to cause equity markets to reassess return prospects after the fall into bear market territory. Long-term bond yields declined steeply, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate to zero, and already-low inflation expectations fell even further. These factors caused the required rate of return to plummet. The present value of equities increases as the required rate of return decreases.\\nA fair value for U.S. equities\\nNotes: Vanguard\\'s U.S. fair value CAPE framework is based on a statistical model that corrects measures of cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratios for the level of inflation expectations and for interest rates. The statistical model specification is a three-variable vector error correction including equity-earnings yields, ten-year trailing inflation, and ten-year U.S. Treasury yields. For details, see Vanguard\\'s Global Macro Matters paper As U.S. Stock Prices Rise, the Risk-Return Trade-Off Gets Tricky (Joseph Davis, 2017).\\nSources: Vanguard calculations as of July 31, 2020, based on data from Robert Shiller\\'s website at aida.wss.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm., the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Reserve Board, and Global Financial Data.\\n\\nVanguard\\'s proprietary fair value CAPE (cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio) framework models the relationship among equity valuations, long-term bond yields, and inflation. It shows a fair value range that has moved higher since the first quarter. Interestingly, the S&P 500 CAPE at the end of July falls right in the middle of this range, meaning that valuations as of that date are fair based on interest rates and inflation, which we view as a proxy for the required rate of return.\\nAs for the future …\\nWhat does this mean for future equity prices? That depends. A higher fair value range now won\\'t necessarily remain elevated or continue to increase. Nor does it mean that market prices won\\'t deviate from fair value temporarily. A normalization in interest rates and inflation expectations would cause fair value to fall (all else being equal), but prices may not immediately follow because of other short-term factors. Over longer periods, though, we\\'d expect these deviations to revert to fair value as they have over the last 70 years, as shown in the illustration.\\nVanguard\\'s global economics team doesn’t expect monetary policy to normalize anytime soon. On the contrary, we believe the federal funds rate will remain near zero at least through 2021. We also believe that demand-supply imbalances will likely lead to lower (not higher) inflation in developed countries for the foreseeable future, despite unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy. This would suggest that fair value is unlikely to change significantly.\\nBetter-than-expected news about the development of a vaccine or effective therapy could cause equity prices to deviate into overvalued territory. Conversely, if these developments take longer or containment measures prove unsuccessful, prices could move into undervalued territory as market sentiment suffers.\\nAccurately predicting such surprises and untangling them from market prices is difficult at best. We may not be able to predict the market’s next move with any degree of confidence, but we can say that a reasonable basis exists for its current level.\\nThe writer would like to acknowledge the contributions of Kelly Farley and Ian Kresnak, CFA, to this commentary.\\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the pandemic: What to expect from stocks, bonds\\nRead this introduction to how Vanguard\\'s return expectations for stocks and bonds have changed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.View article\\n\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.\\nInvestments in bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.\\n\\nCFA® is a registered trademark owned by CFA Institute.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The volatility of the financial markets during the first half of 2020, punctuated by the most sudden, steep decline in U.S. market history, tested the mettle of most investors. Despite the gut-wrenching drop of nearly 34% in the S&P 500 Index in just over a month, Vanguard investors held firm, sticking with their plans and, in some cases, rebalancing into equities during the downturn. This discipline ultimately results in better outcomes over the long term.\\nThe courage to stay the course\\nWe\\'ve long professed that short-term market movements—whether up or down—should not dictate one\\'s investment strategy. The data show that Vanguard investors agree, and the overwhelming majority stayed invested through the recent volatility. Less than 0.5% of investors abandoned their portfolios and moved entirely to cash. A willingness to weather sudden market drops is an important part of long-term investing. Although it is a natural instinct to seek to preserve capital when the market drops precipitously, too often investors remain on the sidelines and miss the inevitable recovery.\\nBack in March, we reminded investors to stay the course. A balanced, diversified portfolio is built to weather tough markets. The majority of investors (83%) held fast from late February to May and didn\\'t transact. Even better, 9% of our clients rebalanced into the storm, buying equities and regaining their targeted asset allocations. Rebalancing helps mitigate risk, and it is a staple of our advice.\\nInvestors in Vanguard retirement accounts have shown the lowest proclivity to trade. IRA holders and participants in defined contribution plans trade at minimal levels and far less than other cohorts. They truly keep a long-term perspective and don\\'t get thrown off by short-term volatility.\\nWhy is staying the course so important? As an extreme example, consider the investor who lost faith in the markets and cashed out on March 23, the low point in the U.S. stock market. Stocks subsequently rebounded more than 39% over the next three months; the unfortunate individual who moved to a money market fund earned a meager 0.14%. Our analysis found that about 85% of investors who fled to cash would have been better off if they had just held their own portfolio.\\nEven-keeled at all times\\nJust as investors should stay even-keeled during downturns, they should ignore the euphoria of a sudden surge in the market and the fear of missing out on easy gains. One byproduct of the market churn is the renaissance of day trading among individual investors. Online brokerage platforms saw new accounts spike in the early part of 2020, with many of these investors looking to capitalize on \"hot\" stocks or engage in speculative moves. Fortunately, the vast majority of Vanguard investors are staying disciplined and avoiding speculation. We have seen this movie before and know how it ends for the FOMO crowd—an expensive lesson about diversification.\\nThank you to our clients\\nWe would be remiss if we did not thank you for helping investors stay disciplined and focused on the long run. We are here to help reinforce those best practices and are grateful for the commitment each of you has shown our company. Investors added $130 billion in net new investments to Vanguard funds during the first seven months of 2020.

       "  'content': 'At the end of last year, Vanguard published its annual global economic outlook for 2020 and beyond. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, upending financial markets and the global economy.\\nWe sat down with economists in Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group to take stock of how the pandemic has reshaped their outlook for the economy and where they see markets going from here.\\nThe title of Vanguard’s outlook for 2020 was “The New Age of Uncertainty.” It seems almost prophetic in retrospect.\\nJoe Davis, Vanguard global chief economist: It\\'s true that we were expecting heightened uncertainty this year owing to concerns about global growth, unpredictable policymaking, trade tensions, and Brexit negotiations. But we couldn\\'t have foreseen a viral pandemic that would be so devastating in terms of human cost, curtailed economic activity, and disrupted financial markets. It\\'s really an unprecedented event that defies conventional labels.\\nWe\\'ve been broadly supportive of the extraordinarily rapid and robust monetary and fiscal responses from governments worldwide to blunt the damage. Many central banks have embraced a \"whatever it takes\" approach, which has included slashing interest rates and providing liquidity to financial markets. And the world\\'s largest economies have committed more than $9 trillion in spending, loans, and loan guarantees toward countering the negative effects of the pandemic.1\\nThat notwithstanding, while this may be the deepest and shortest recession in modern economic history, I want to stress that we see a long road back to a previrus economy.\\nWith many countries having just gone through extraordinarily quick and sharp declines in GDP, there\\'s been a lot of speculation in the financial media about what shape the recovery will take. What\\'s Vanguard’s view?\\nPeter Westaway, Vanguard chief economist for Europe: Indeed, the hit to economic activity has been severe. We estimate the overall peak-to-trough global GDP contraction was around 9% in the first half of 2020. Comparable collapses in economic activity are hard to find outside wartime: Global GDP fell 6% peak to trough during the global financial crisis,2 for example, and by 1.8% during the 1973 oil crisis.3\\nSo what will the recovery look like? Will it be V-shaped or U-shaped? Probably a little of both. We anticipate a first phase characterized by a rapid recovery in the supply side of the economy as businesses reopen and restrictions are eased. We expect that to be followed by a second, more protracted phase in which demand, especially in sensitive face-to-face sectors, only gradually returns.\\nOverall the trajectory of the recovery is likely to be an elongated U-shape, with GDP growth not returning to normal until well into 2021 and quite possibly beyond in major economies. The one exception is China. Our baseline assessment is that a vaccine won\\'t be widely available before the end of 2021; a vaccine sooner than that would make us more optimistic about the prospects for recovery. But we unfortunately see risks around our forecast skewed to the downside, strongly linked to health outcomes and the potential for instances of the virus to necessitate renewed widespread shutdowns.\\nProjected economic recovery in the United States\\nNotes: The chart shows our expectation for the level of impact on real GDP. Total GDP impact signifies the percentage-point change in the level of GDP.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nQian Wang, Vanguard chief economist for Asia-Pacific: Peter mentioned that China would be an exception. We expect the recovery to be faster and more V-shaped in China, for a couple of reasons. China has so far managed to contain the virus relatively quickly, and its economy has a larger share of manufacturing and construction activities, which rely less on face-to-face interaction and benefit from the government boost to infrastructure investment. In fact, we\\'re seeing many industries in China not only recovering but clawing back lost output not produced during the lockdown, so we expect its economy to return more quickly to previrus levels.\\nProjected economic recovery in China\\nNotes: The chart shows our expectation for the level of impact on real GDP. Total GDP impact signifies the percentage-point change in the level of GDP.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nRoger Aliaga-Díaz, Vanguard chief economist for the Americas: Latin America, meanwhile, faces an especially challenging period. Brazil, Latin America\\'s largest economy, has had a particularly hard time containing the virus. The World Health Organization puts the number of confirmed cases in that country second only to the number in the United States.4 Peru, Chile, and Mexico also are among the ten countries with the highest number of confirmed cases, according to the WHO. The International Monetary Fund in June downgraded its economic outlook for Latin America to a full-year contraction of 9.4%, having projected a contraction of 5.2% for the period just three months earlier.\\nJoe Davis: I\\'d add a word of context about GDP data for the second half of 2020. We expect to see a rebound in quarterly GDP growth rates, especially in the third quarter, when restrictions on activity related to the virus will have eased to a degree. And that will doubtless generate positive headlines and more talk of a V-shaped recovery. A more relevant measure than the quarterly rate of change, though, is the underlying level of GDP. And for 2020, for the first time in modern economic history, we expect the global economy to shrink, by about 3%. We believe that some of the largest economies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the euro area, will contract by 8% to 10%.\\nHow the pandemic has reshaped our GDP projections for 2020\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nWhat does the prospect of only gradual economic growth mean for employment?\\nPeter Westaway: A lot depends on the fate of furloughed workers. Official measures of unemployment across the globe have risen by historically unprecedented amounts in a short time. And unfortunately, in many countries the true unemployment picture is even worse once furloughed workers are considered—those who are not working but are being paid by governments or employers. There\\'s a chance that furloughed workers could move straight back into work as lockdowns end, which would make this type of unemployment not so costly. But there\\'s a risk that high unemployment will persist, especially considering those who have already lost jobs permanently and the furloughed workers who may not easily move back into work.\\nAt the end of last year, Vanguard was expecting inflation to remain soft. Has your forecast changed in light of the pandemic?\\nJoe Davis: Not significantly. Many commentators have talked up the prospect of a resurgence in inflation in 2021, particularly as the debt-to-GDP ratios of developed economies have increased dramatically because of spending to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. We think it\\'s more likely that inflation overall will be held in check by demand lagging a rebound in supply in all the major economies, especially in face-to-face sectors that we believe will experience a high degree of consumer reluctance until there is a vaccine. That, in turn, could set the stage for central banks to maintain easy terms for accessing money well into 2021.\\nLet\\'s get to what investors may be most interested in—Vanguard\\'s outlook for market returns.\\nJoe Davis: In short, stock market prospects have improved since the market correction, while expected returns from bonds remain subdued. Let\\'s take a closer look at global stocks first. They lost more than 30 percentage points earlier this year and volatility spiked to record levels, then they rallied strongly to regain most of their losses. Despite the negative macroeconomic outlook, we believe there is a reasonable basis for current equity market levels given the impact of low rates, low inflation expectations, and the forward-looking nature of markets.\\nWith current valuations lower than at the end of last year and a higher fair-value range because of lower interest rates, our outlook for U.S. and non-U.S. stock returns has improved considerably for U.S.-based investors. Over the next ten years, we expect the average annual return for those investors to be:\\n\\n4% to 6% for U.S. stocks\\n7% to 9% for non-U.S. stocks\\n\\nSuch differentials, which change over time, help explain why we believe portfolios should be globally diversified.\\nAs for bonds, current yields normally provide a good indication of the level of return that can be expected in the future. With monetary policy having turned more accommodative, our expectation for the average annual return for U.S.-based investors has fallen by about 100 basis points since the end of 2019, to a range of 0% to 2% for U.S. and non-U.S. bonds.\\nAdmittedly, we are in a low-yield environment with low forecast returns for bonds, but we expect high-quality globally diversified fixed income to continue to play the important role of a risk diversifier in a multi-asset portfolio.\\nIt did so earlier this year. Consider a globally diversified portfolio with 60% exposure to stocks and 40% exposure to currency-hedged global fixed income, from a U.S. investor\\'s perspective. It is true that over a few days, the correlation between the global equity and bond markets was positive and that they moved relatively in tandem, but for the first half of 2020, a globally diversified bond exposure acted as ballast, helping to counter the riskier stock component of the portfolio.\\nBonds proved their value as a diversifier of risk in a portfolio\\nNotes: Global equity is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index, global bonds are represented by the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index hedged to USD, and the 60/40 portfolio is made up of 60% global equity and 40% global bonds.\\nSources: Vanguard and Bloomberg.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\nI\\'d caution that investors may be running the risk of pricing assets close to perfection, assuming that corporate profitability will be restored soon or that central bank support can maintain buoyant asset markets for the foreseeable future.\\nWe would advise, as always, that investors maintain diversified portfolios appropriate to their goals, and to invest for the long term. Attempting to time the market during extreme market volatility is tempting but rarely profitable.\\n1 International Monetary Fund as of May 13, 2020.\\n2 The Impact of the Great Recession on Emerging Markets, International Monetary Fund working paper, 2010.\\n3 Maddison, Angus, 1991.

       "  'content': \"The unevenness of the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on economic growth across sectors and by geographic region requires an inspection of both traditional economic data and higher-frequency indicators. New Vanguard Global Macro Matters research analyzes these data in estimating when major economies may approach a full recovery. We expect China to do so more quickly than the United States, the euro area, or the United Kingdom.\\nHow industries will be affected by the pandemic\\nThe impact of containment measures for COVID-19 is not equal across industries. Sectors that are highly reliant on face-to-face interactions, such as retail trade, hospitality, and transport, are experiencing a large shock to activity. However, sectors that can operate relatively well with social distancing in place, such as construction and manufacturing, are less affected.\\nThe COVID-19 shock will have a varied impact on different sectors of the economy\\nNotes: Size of bubbles indicates the relative weight of each sector in U.S. GDP. Initial impact on the level of GDP and the persistence of shock estimated is based on a range of high-frequency indicators (such as mobility indexes, fuel consumption, retail foot traffic, and restaurant and hotel occupancy), and traditional economic indicators.\\nSources: Google, Apple, Johnson Redbook Index, American Iron and Steel Institute, U.S. Department of Energy, Association of American Railroads, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Prodco Analytics, Smith Travel Research, OpenTable, Transportation Security Administration, and SimilarWeb.\\n\\nGDP forecasts across countries\\nThe figures show our baseline forecasts of the level of GDP for the United States, the euro area, China, and the United Kingdom. In the U.S., we expect output to be more than 10% lower in the second quarter of 2020 before staging a slow and gradual recovery. U.S. GDP is not expected to get back to its pre-virus level until the end of 2021, and it likely will be well beyond that before it closes the output gap.\\nExpected path of GDP across the U.S., the euro area, China, and the U.K.\\nBaseline forecast\\nNote: The charts show our expectation for the level of real GDP in each country in its local currency, which has been rebased to December 2019 = 100.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nWe expect slightly different trajectories for the level of GDP in other regions. This can be explained by a variety of factors, including:\\n\\nDifferences in the timing and severity of outbreaks.\\nStrictness of government lockdowns.\\nSpeed of the lockdown exit across sectors.\\nEconomy sector composition.\\nMonetary and fiscal policy responses.\\n\\nFor example, China has so far managed to contain the virus more quickly than the U.S. or Europe, and its economy has a smaller share dedicated to services, which rely more heavily on face-to-face interaction. It is therefore expected to recover to pre-virus levels more quickly. Get more insights on the worldwide economic activity in our full research paper below.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The coronavirus pandemic has exacted a staggering toll in terms of economic impact and the loss of life. It has also produced many heroes, including frontline health care workers and retail employees who enable people to stay well provisioned in isolation.\\nFinancial advisors can serve a critical role as well by helping clients maintain their emotional well-being and increase their chances of emerging from the crisis with their financial dreams intact.\\nVanguard Senior Advice Strategist Mike DiJoseph recently answered a number of advisors\\' questions on how to help clients manage their emotions. He explained that taking such a behavioral coaching approach can help clients avoid making in-the-moment, reactionary decisions they may regret in the long run.\\nDiJoseph suggested approaching engagements with clients by using a “three A’s” framework (see graphic below):\\n\\nAssess the situation that demands a behavioral coaching solution.\\nAddress it by developing an appropriate course of action.\\nAudit the results and discuss them with clients, demonstrating your value in the process.\\n\\nBehavioral coaching: three A’s of action for advisors\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nFollowing is a summary of DiJoseph\\'s question and answer session with advisors.\\nHow do you keep clients focused on long-term risk during crises such as the coronavirus pandemic?\\nFirst, it\\'s important to provide perspective on what a crisis happening in the moment is. So our team at Vanguard examined the questions: What do bear markets look and feel like in the moment and how does that compare with perceptions after the fact, with the benefit of hindsight?\\nFor example, we looked at the bear market from 2008 through 2009. We examined news headlines from that period and noted the overall sentiment of gloom they conveyed.\\nWe tracked the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 index from its market bottom in March 2009 to its recovery breakeven point less than two years later. By the time the headlines expressed positive sentiment, the market had already completely recovered.\\nWe\\'re not saying that scenario will play out again in the same way. And today\\'s crisis has the added dimension that it\\'s threatening people\\'s physical health. At the same time, it doesn\\'t mean this situation is never going to get better. We, as people offering our financial expertise, just need to provide that perspective. That\\'s the first part.\\nThe second part of keeping your clients thinking long term is to actually talk about what long term means to them. For most investors, it means meeting their goals. So I would suggest talking about what’s going on in terms of a client’s percentage progress toward those goals. Is the client still on track? Most advisors have already planned for periodic downturns that affect client portfolios. So it’s good to remind clients of that.\\nHow do you help clients who still want to sell out of the market based on extreme panic or fear?\\nOftentimes you just have to meet clients where they are. If you have a client who\\'s responding with emotions, I think you need to meet the client with emotions. If you have somebody who\\'s responding analytically, your initial engagement similarly would be analytic: Show the potential impact of what happens if the client bails out to cash, what returns the client might expect, and how the client’s ability to meet their goals might change.\\nI think for most people, investors and professionals alike, the most effective appeal is a combination of the two. This is the \"assess\" part of the three A\\'s framework: What happened to bear markets in the past and what happened in health crises in the past? How did those play out?\\nA huge part of this step is applying emotional intelligence and serving as the calming voice of reason—after letting the client voice their concerns in their own way. You may have heard of this referred to as \"EQ,\" or having the emotional quotient to interact sensitively with others. As an advisor, you need to have confidence that the work you’ve done upfront to put a plan in place will see a client through difficult times.\\nDepending on how clients react to that, sometimes it really does just come down to finding a compromise. Maybe you have a client who wants to completely bail out of the market no matter how much analysis you provide them with, no matter how emotionally soothing your advice may be: They\\'re just not really having it.\\nAnd in those cases, you might want to look at a very small bit of de-risking or even framing a decision not to rebalance as something that reduces risk.\\nHow should you talk with clients who are retirees or who want to retire soon?\\nIf a client just retired within the last year or two, or if the client is thinking about retiring next year, now can be a particularly scary time.\\nThe good news is there are a ton of things you can do as an advisor to add value. So when we\\'re talking about assessing that situation, you want to look into the client\\'s plan and see what their spending requirement is. What are those end goals?\\nThen, you need to address the situation—the second component of our framework—and there are a number of tools you can use.\\nSo, for example, many clients may have some tax losses that can be harvested. You should think about potentially cleaning up the portfolio itself with tools such as rebalancing, but there are also things such as asset location. That is, how are the assets distributed across different types of accounts, i.e., tax-deferred accounts, tax-free accounts, and taxable accounts?\\nYou can also address retirement spending. Our team at Vanguard has done research for years on what happens during market downturns when it comes to spending rates and spending strategies. What we\\'ve found is that decreasing spending by just 2.5% in lean years and increasing it a little bit in prosperous years—a concept we call dynamic spending—can have dramatic positive effects on the long-term outcome and viability of a portfolio.1\\nWhat is the distinction between cognitive error and emotional bias? And how can you mitigate the counterproductive effects of your clients\\' biases?\\nWe do need to draw a sharp distinction between behavioral finance and behavioral coaching. With behavioral finance, we\\'re talking about the heuristics and biases—why people make the decisions they do, why those decisions aren\\'t always rational, and why they may lead to bad outcomes.\\nYou could consider it a really scientific way to look at it. I liken it to IQ. I think behavioral coaching is really applying the EQ, the emotional intelligence, to connect with a client and overcome their natural biases. There is an intellectual aspect to it as well, but you\\'re really keying in on the client’s emotional state to guide them toward better financial decisions.\\nIt\\'s worth noting we\\'ve published work on the importance of positivity when you\\'re engaged in behavioral coaching.2\\nIt ties back to the idea mentioned earlier, of meeting emotion with emotion. It really comes down to positivity. And by that I don\\'t mean, \"Hey, everything\\'s fine, the market\\'s not down, and we\\'re not in the middle of a health crisis.\" Clients obviously know that\\'s not true.\\nInstead, I\\'m talking about reframing the situation: Being upfront about clients\\' reactions and telling them, \"Hey, they\\'re natural.\"\\n\"You feel like you want to bail from the stock market today. It\\'s natural to think that because it\\'s gone down for the last two or three weeks, and it\\'s likely to happen again. That\\'s okay.\"\\nThe positive aspect of this is simply acknowledging that it\\'s okay for them to have those worries. Fortunately, they\\'ve hired you to prepare them for something like this happening. That\\'s how you can make your clients feel a little more empowered—reminding them that their portfolios are prepared to weather the storm we\\'re in right now.\\nIs there a way to use this unique environment as an opportunity when it comes to prospecting and potentially helping a greater number of clients?\\nYou\\'re in the trenches with your clients in these trying times, building trust in the process. I think that will pay dividends as the clients you help today go forth, after the dust settles, and articulate their experience working with you. They will remember the way that you made them feel, and they\\'ll talk about it with potential prospective clients.\\nSomething you might consider in the \"opportunity basket\" is everything we\\'ve been seeing and hearing with the move to digital. In less than a month, we\\'ve undergone a massive societal change. We\\'ve transitioned from an office-based, person-to-person service paradigm to a setting where everything—in our space, at least—is digital.\\nThis is an interesting issue to think about for the audit portion of our framework. It\\'s a chance to really consider how you connect with others. And I think that\\'s going to be a big opportunity. We can see how this may be an inflection point for a world where geographic boundaries become less important in the advice industry. So I encourage you to start thinking through that—what lessons have you learned from the widespread adoption of digital meetings by necessity and how might you apply them to your advantage in the future?\\nA client\\'s portfolio is positioned a bit aggressively rather than being diversified. The client wants to know what you\\'re doing to stop the decline?\\nI would reframe the client\\'s question to, \"Is their asset allocation correct in the first place?\"\\nAsking someone how they feel about losing 30% on their investment in the middle of a crisis is probably a better depiction of true sentiment than asking a client how they feel at the height of a decade-long bull market.\\nThere\\'s a balance to strike, because you don\\'t necessarily want to be making wholesale changes to the financial plan during the crisis itself. Maybe you should just not rebalance and let the asset allocation change to more conservative from there. I think that might be a good compromise.\\nIt\\'s a big opportunity to give your client a win—talking about diversification now when a client can see, firsthand, precisely why it matters. Contrast that to the questions you might have been hearing just a few months ago: Why the heck do I have these bonds in my portfolio when the stock market\\'s up 30%?\\nOn a related note, some clients say they\\'ve been severely tested and they think bonds are the way to go. Thoughts on this sentiment?\\nYou might add some perspective on low rates going forward.\\nIt comes down to helping the client think through that sentiment: If the client were to take that course of action, what does that look like going forward? And you should do that in a way that ties it back to the emotional aspect of helping the client remember why they\\'re investing in the first place—to achieve a specific goal.\\nSo let\\'s say you have a 50-year-old client who wants to retire in ten years. But that seems out of reach given that the client has lost 10%, 20%, 30% of their portfolio value.\\nYou have to ask yourself, well, \"What are the alternatives?\" The alternative of reallocating assets to cash investments is probably going to get a zero return. With a reallocation to bonds, I think we all believe that bonds will continue to be a diversifying asset and a ballast to equity risk but I\\'m not sure bonds are really going to be a high-income-producing asset going forward.\\nSo put that in terms of what that means. How much does the client need for retirement and what are the client’s chances of reaching that if they make the decision to rebalance? Again—with empathy—explain that abandoning equities entirely means the client is almost guaranteed to not be able to meet that goal. So just a little bit of perspective can go a long way.\\n1 Colleen M. Jaconetti, Michael A. DiJoseph, Zoe B. Odenwalder, and Francis M. Kinniry Jr., 2016.

Before they try to negotiate the array of choices, have them consider what elements of Medicare insurance coverage they think are most important.\\nEvaluate plan options based on how well they fit a client\\'s priorities. No plan is perfect for everyone, so individual clients must find the policy types that come the closest to meeting their priorities.\\nOnce your clients know their best matches, they can shop for specific policies.

The actively managed fund will hold a concentrated portfolio of companies that both are involved in the process of decarbonization and derive at least half of their revenue from activities deemed by the fund\\'s advisor to contribute positively to environmental change. The fund will be managed by Ninety One, an experienced active investment manager with a proven track record in environmental, decarbonization, and global investing.\\n\"Vanguard has been thoughtful and deliberate in building out our ESG lineup by ensuring each new fund addresses investors\\' enduring needs\" said Dan Reyes, head of Vanguard Portfolio Review Department. \"We are confident that Ninety One\\'s differentiated approach to global ESG investing will add long-term value for risk-tolerant investors who have a preference for environmental investing.\"\\nFounded in 1991, Ninety One manages approximately $160 billion globally.1 The Global Environmental Opportunities Stock Fund takes a structured, research-driven approach to investing that targets companies seeking to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon world. Ninety One\\'s investment philosophy is cemented in the conviction that there are structural growth opportunities resulting from trends in regulation, technology, and consumer preferences, which are driving a multi-decade energy transition. The firm believes that companies that successfully navigate this transition are likely to create value for investors over the long term. This will be the first Vanguard fund advised by Ninety One.\\nThe fund is designed for environmentally conscious investors who have a high tolerance for risk and want to augment a broadly diversified portfolio with a satellite position. The fund is expected to launch in the fourth quarter of 2022 with a competitive expense ratio of 0.75% for Investor Shares and 0.60% for Admiral Shares, compared with the industry average of 0.99% for similar funds.2 The fund\\'s minimum investments are $3,000 for Investor Shares and $50,000 for Admiral Shares.\\nVanguard\\'s ESG lineup\\nVanguard takes a disciplined, research-based approach to product development and has thoughtfully expanded its lineup of ESG funds, introducing funds and ETFs that exhibit enduring investment merit while addressing investors\\' evolving preferences. The new fund will complement Vanguard\\'s existing ESG lineup, including its two existing actively managed ESG funds. The recently launched Vanguard Baillie Gifford Global Positive Impact Stock Fund is designed for clients who want a strategy that targets both investment and impact objectives. Vanguard Global ESG Select Stock Fund caters to clients who want to maximize returns while having greater exposure to companies with attractive ESG characteristics. Vanguard also offers exclusionary-screened index equity and fixed income ETFs for investors who want to avoid or reduce exposure to certain sectors or ESG risks in their portfolio.\\n1 Data as of June 30, 2022.2 Sources: Morningstar, Vanguard.\\nNotes:\\nRegistration statements relating to Vanguard Global Environmental Opportunities Stock Fund have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) but have not yet become effective. The SEC has not approved or disapproved these securities or passed upon the adequacy of either fund\\'s preliminary prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is considered a criminal offense. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statements become effective.

Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.\\nESG funds are subject to ESG investment risk, which is the chance that the stocks or bonds screened by the index provider for ESG criteria generally will underperform the market as a whole or, in the aggregate, will trail returns of other funds screened for ESG criteria. The index provider\\'s assessment of a company, based on the company\\'s level of involvement in a particular industry or the index provider\\'s own ESG criteria, may differ from that of other funds or of the advisor\\'s or an investor\\'s assessment of such company. As a result, the companies deemed eligible by the index provider may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics. The evaluation of companies for ESG screening or integration is dependent on the timely and accurate reporting of ESG data by the companies. Successful application of the screens will depend on the index provider’s proper identification and analysis of ESG data. The advisor may not be successful in assessing and identifying companies that have or will have a positive impact or support a given position. In some circumstances, companies could ultimately have a negative impact, or no impact.\\nVanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.\\nInvestments in securities issued by non-U.S. companies and governments are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk.

Their desire has made environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, also known as socially responsible, faith-based, values-driven, or sustainable investing, a burgeoning trend.1\\nIt\\'s true that you can help align clients\\' investments with their preferences using off-the-shelf ETFs and mutual funds. But for clients with very specific ideas about causes or issues they want their investments to support or exclude, Vanguard Personalized Indexing could be a more precise solution.\\nGet more than \"E\" for environmental\\nLike many people, your clients may focus mostly on the \"E\" of ESG—that is, environmental concerns like a company\\'s carbon footprint or involvement with fossil fuels—but ESG investing can cover a much wider range of issues. For example, your clients can:\\n\\nIncorporate religious preferences into their portfolios.\\nAvoid investing in companies involved in activities they find objectionable, such as predatory lending or gambling.\\nSupport companies that pay their workers a fair living wage or that advance diversity on the board of directors.\\nChoose multiple issues to tailor the portfolio\\'s focus to suit their preferences. A client could focus on specific social issues as well as climate change, for example.\\n\\nWhat makes a personalized indexing portfolio so flexible? It\\'s all in the structure—and its easy-to-use technology. With mutual funds or ETFs, investors own a single fund that bundles individual stocks together. With a Vanguard Personalized Indexing portfolio, investors own individual stocks directly in separately managed accounts (SMAs). The stocks in each SMA represent a benchmark that you and your client select. Direct ownership of each stock makes an SMA fully customizable—you can build portfolios that precisely reflect each client\\'s preferences and outlook.\\nCustomize SMAs with screens and tilts\\nYou can use negative screens, positive tilts, or a combination of both to tailor your clients\\' portfolios with personalized indexing.\\n\\nA screen eliminates certain companies, sectors, or industries from a client\\'s portfolio entirely, according to criteria each client selects. For example, your client might want to avoid any investment with companies that produce adult entertainment or nuclear weapons, or that violate their religious principles. You can even screen out a single company if a client has strong feelings against investing in it.Use screens in cases where you need to ensure that all companies that violate a client\\'s principles are excluded from the portfolio.\\nTilts add a preferential weight to a portfolio that helps improve its focus on topics that are important to a client. In contrast to the black-and-white exclusion of screens, you can use tilts to help clients support issues that fall within a gradient. Examples include weighting a portfolio with companies that are moving toward a lower carbon footprint or are increasing the number of women in leadership roles.Think of it this way: Tilts let clients express support of companies that engage in \"good\" behavior on an issue, whereas screens let them express disapproval of \"bad\" behavior by a company.2\\n\\nVanguard Personalized Indexing offers a wide range of screens and tilts for your clients to choose from. You can also request custom options, such as faith-based or vegan. Once your clients have made their selections, you can generate impact and performance reports on demand, so clients can have a clear picture of the impact of their customizations.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nHarness the power of Vanguard Personalized Indexing\\nRequest a demo today to discover how Vanguard Personalized Indexing can help deliver additional value to you and your clients.Explore Vanguard Personalized Indexing\\n\\n\\nKeep an eye on customization and risk levels\\nVanguard Personalized Indexing is a flexible, transparent way to customize a client’s portfolio, but sometimes customizations can require special consideration from you.\\n\\nTracking error: You can apply as many customizations to clients\\' personalized indexing portfolios as they wish. However, each customization can potentially increase tracking error from the portfolio\\'s underlying benchmark, increasing a client\\'s risk.\\nLimited market exposure: A client who wants to screen out all companies that have engaged in controversial activities could be left with very few companies to invest in, potentially limiting their exposure to the market and reducing their portfolio’s diversification benefits.\\nContradictory tilts: When too many tilts are chosen, they tend to cancel each other out, diluting the client\\'s desired impact.\\n\\nIn these cases, you can help your clients understand that positive impact doesn\\'t require perfection. Together, you and your clients can prioritize their goals. That way, you can ensure that each personalized index is customized effectively and that clients are comfortable with the risk level in their portfolios.\\nDeepen client relationships\\nVanguard Personalized Indexing gives you the power to offer clients a highly personalized, index-based, tax-efficient solution that incorporates their unique preferences. It can also give you an opportunity to forge deeper emotional connections with your clients as you discuss their varying interests and experiences and how they might want to incorporate them into their investments.'},\n",

Comparison evaluated on annualized total return of the Emerging Markets Debt Funds Average.\\n\\xa0Why emerging markets bonds?\\nEmerging markets debt stands out from other parts of the credit market for three reasons.\\nPerformance history\\nEmerging markets external debt (dollar-denominated bonds of emerging markets sovereign issuers) has a long history of strong risk-adjusted returns as this chart shows:\\nAn asset class with an intriguing risk-return profile\\n20-year horizon, from March 31, 2002–March 31, 2022\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, using data from Bloomberg, J.P. Morgan, S&P Dow Jones Indices, MSCI, and Russell.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index. \\nNote: Volatility calculated as annualized standard deviation of monthly returns.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nGreater global diversification\\nEmerging markets debt is significantly more diversified than it has ever been, with numerous new issuers from both sides of the credit spectrum. The category includes low-income countries from sub-Saharan Africa and wealthy oil exporters from the Persian Gulf. A more diversified issuer base translates into less idiosyncratic risk and more active management opportunities.\\nSovereign resilience\\nAnother strength of this asset class is the resilience of sovereign issuers. Emerging markets countries have access to pools of financing from multilateral and bilateral lenders not available to private issuers. They also can fund domestically and raise additional revenues through taxes.\\nThis certainly does not make emerging markets investments risk-free, and defaults do happen, but the incentive to pay the debt is very high. In fact, recovery rates after default are often higher than for corporate issuers because countries do not simply disappear as a company may. Once a recovery is in place, returns from emerging markets debt can be very significant as longer bond maturities can sustain price appreciation and countries strive to improve their credit fundamentals.\\nWhy emerging markets now?\\nThe specific case for emerging markets debt comes down to valuations and improving technical factors, while fundamentals are mixed. Many emerging markets issuers will continue to benefit from higher commodity prices, but some are exposed to higher import costs for food and fuel. Government revenues have been strong, but higher imported inflation is increasing costs for domestic borrowing as costs for external borrowing have risen.\\nFinancial markets have already factored current fundamental risks into prices. As of June 30, the J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Global Bond Index Diversified yield stood at 8.57%. For comparison, this yield just touched 8% during the peak of the COVID liquidity crisis in March of 2020, and the last time we saw these levels was in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The more than 22% drawdown since the middle of September 20211 already exceeds the worst drop in 2020 and is within 5% of the peak drawdown in 2008.\\nEmerging markets debt is further along in its adjustment. Triggered by early signs of global monetary tightening, the emerging markets sell-off began in the fourth quarter of 2021, much earlier than in the sell-off in the broader credit market. That's one reason we believe emerging markets debt is closer to its bottom and better positioned for recovery than other asset classes. The rapid selloff in spreads and global interest rates has resulted in historically low dollar prices for emerging markets bonds. While this mostly supports distressed issuers that may be forced to restructure (minimizing any loss given default), it should also result in tighter spreads for healthy credits, given the lower dollar amount investors have to put at risk for each bond purchased.\\nTechnical factors are improving. Weaker emerging markets issuers (over 20% of the market) are currently locked out of market access and will need to fund through alternative means. Another 20% of the market consists of wealthy oil exporters with very low funding needs due to high oil revenues. As a result, we expect to see negative net issuance this year, offsetting the impact of fund outflows. While emerging markets funds (along with other fixed income products) continue to see outflows, those outflows are relatively contained as a percentage of assets under management. Given high cash levels in emerging markets funds, any stabilization or reversal in flows could lead to a rapid repricing higher.\\nBottom line, emerging markets fixed income is attractive\\nWhile it's always hard to pick the exact bottom, we feel comfortable about the outlook for emerging markets debt returns for 12 to 18 months. We're now positioned constructively in our emerging markets portfolios and encourage you to consider increasing allocations to emerging markets debt in your clients' portfolios.\"},\n",

Volatile market and economic conditions further complicate investment planning.\\nFor that reason, Vanguard offers a variety of multiasset portfolio solutions that allow you to customize your clients\\' investments to varying degrees, giving you more time to spend building relationships and growing your business.\\nBehind those solutions is a portfolio construction framework that is innovative and consistent, informing methodologies and investment solutions that are constantly monitored to ensure alignment with their objectives.\\nThe guiding philosophy behind our framework\\nVanguard\\'s portfolio construction framework begins with four core principles for investment success, all integral to productive advisory relationships.\\nThose tenets map directly to the elements of our framework, as shown below in Figure 1, below, which in turn are operationalized in the investment solutions available to you and your clients. The framework is market-tested, repeatable, and supported by proprietary internal quantitative models such as the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM) and the Vanguard Asset Allocation Model (VAAM), which enable customization of portfolios in a scalable and internally consistent manner across Vanguard multiasset solutions.\\nVanguard\\'s investment principles\\nFigure 1.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nMapping our principles to your practice\\n\\nYour work with clients to define clear and appropriate goals is the first step toward investment success through portfolio construction. Broader financial goals such as wealth-building or achieving a certain portfolio income are the focus of our framework and process.\\nBalance refers to the importance we place on diversification in avoiding uncompensated portfolio risk, to help you set clients\\' expectations and avoid performance \"surprise\" conversations. A rigorous quantification of investment risks for all asset classes and investment strategies is fundamental to our framework, and manifests in asset return forecasts and simulation models such as VCMM.\\nOur focus on cost goes right to you clients\\' bottom line, as we seek to minimize investment fees and other expenses that can compound over time and eat into returns. Our framework can account for more advanced cost aspects such as taxes, trading expenses, and the impact of liquidity in asset prices.\\nFinally, your coaching of client discipline centers on maintaining a long-term perspective and avoiding emotional reactions, particularly during periods of market turmoil. Accounting for various degrees of risk tolerance in our portfolio construction models can help you keep clients on plan through periods of market volatility.\\n\\nPowering the portfolios: Vanguard\\'s quantitative tools\\nVCMM: Asset return expectations\\nOptimizing clients\\' portfolios using asset return forecasts (or capital market assumptions) can help align performance or volatility expectations with a portfolio\\'s stated objectives. That\\'s why these forecasts are an explicit input in our asset allocation process. A simple asset allocation approach, considering no more than two or three asset classes, may yield very reasonable portfolios. VCMM is our proprietary statistical engine for optimizing more complex portfolios with numerous asset and sub-asset classes and multiple estimates for average returns, volatilities, and their correlations. Asset return distributions, not just asset return forecasts, are the main output from the VCMM and the key input in portfolio construction.\\nImportant features of the VCMM algorithm include:\\n\\nA probabilistic or distributional framework.\\nReliance on key economic and market valuation forecasting signals with a better track record over medium- and long-term horizons. Short-term forecasting is extremely difficult and very inaccurate.\\nConsideration of initial conditions: Over the medium term, expected returns depend on initial valuations such as price/earnings ratios and interest rate levels.\\nReliance on forward-looking equilibrium assumptions for certain economic or market drivers, such as long-run inflation, productivity growth, currency trends, and central bank neutral policy rates. The VCMM assumptions are inputs from Vanguard\\'s Global Economics Team.\\nAllowance for nonnormal distribution, featuring a higher probability of tail events than a normal distribution would suggest.\\n\\nVAAM: Model-based portfolio construction\\nAs you know, an investor\\'s financial goals involve the type of financial goal, the assets to be considered, the investment horizon, asset return expectations, and the investor\\'s appetite for financial risk.\\nVAAM, our asset allocation engine, accounts for these using a utility-driven representation of investor outcomes to maximize investors chances of achieving their financial goals, conditional on their risk tolerance.\\nUtility functions are mathematical representations of an investor\\'s attitude toward investment risk. They capture the trade-off any investor faces in balancing the desire for higher portfolio returns against increased risk.\\nVAAM-based portfolio construction process\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nA range of solutions to help meet client\\'s needs\\nOur portfolio construction framework is the underpinning of all of our model portfolio solutions. Our total return strategic model portfolios all take a market-capitalization approach, using a variety of benchmarks and Vanguard ETFs® to offer well-diversified broad exposure at low cost. These are complemented by market-cap model portfolios that emphasize tax efficiency and that seek to generate income. All are available with a range of stock and bond allocations to help address individual client needs.\\nThese solutions provide market-like returns with little potential for outperformance, but little risk of underperformance either. Their simplicity, no-surprises approach, and low fiduciary risk make them a great starting place for many investors with general wealth accumulation goals, and their long-term perspective seeks to provide a low-volatility, consistent approach to your clients.\\nCustom model portfolios, which seek to outperform the broad public benchmarks, albeit with additional risk, are available to support more specific investor needs and preferences.\\nThese include (any combination of):\\nPortfolios with risk factor tilts. For clients who may benefit from overweighting sub-asset classes such as value equities or international fixed income.\\nESG portfolios. Portfolios that emphasize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations.\\nDirect-index portfolios. These offer personalized index construction using any appropriate combination of tax-loss harvesting strategies, highly personalized ESG filters, or tailored factor investing.\\nUsing solutions like these to incorporate the Vanguard portfolio construction framework in your practice can help you provide a customized approach to client outcomes, while positioning you to reap the benefits of scale and consistency within your portfolio management process.\\n\\n\\n\\nCompare any two portfolios in seconds\\nUse our free Portfolio Manager tool to create hypothetical client portfolios and evaluate their potential response to current market conditions.

       "  'content': 'Rising inflation has unleashed waves of selling in public markets, creating the need—or opportunity—for ETF-centric advisors to make time-sensitive portfolio adjustments that aim to improve after-tax returns and that are in line with clients\\' estimated capital gains profile and personal tax situation.\\nFor advisors exploring such adjustments given recent market volatility, or specifically looking to take advantage of tax-loss harvesting (TLH) trades, we walk you through below how to approach or organize such trades, which can be large and complicated.\\nBroad market stock indexes lost more than 14% year to date through May, and some indexes, such as those that follow technology stocks, have declined more than 20%. Often when stock prices fall, bond prices rise, but as economic data show continued high inflation and the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to confront it, we’ve even seen the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index fall more than 9% this year.1\\nBroad market pullbacks in 2022 have affected stocks and bonds alike\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nNote: Index data as of May 31, 2022.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThis presents a meaningful potential opportunity to harvest tax losses in both the stock and bond markets. So let\\'s explore that possibility and consider some best practices to employ, with particular focus on the bond market.\\nTLH with bond ETFs\\nFor those less familiar with tax-loss harvesting, TLH is the strategy of selling securities at a loss, which offsets capital gains and reduces one\\'s tax liability. Given the transparency and tradability of ETFs, which were first developed in the early 1990s, executing TLH trades at scale has probably never been as feasible as it is now using ETFs—even bond ETFs.\\nFor advisors committed to a TLH strategy after analyzing the mix of their clients\\' capital gains, clients\\' personal tax situations, and the market outlook, let\\'s zoom in on some more specific trading considerations. Because TLH trades can be relatively large, they need to be planned carefully to optimize execution quality.\\nSetting the stage\\nFor ETF investors, TLH often results in the sale of an ETF accompanied by the simultaneous purchase of a similar but not substantially identical ETF. The goal is to harvest the loss in the original ETF investment, adhere to the wash-sale rule, and provide similar investment exposure after the TLH trading is completed.2\\nAlso, while bond market volumes in 2022 have been well above normal, liquidity in bond ETFs remains plentiful. And trading spreads on fixed income ETFs in general, while wider when markets are volatile than when they are steady, remain narrower than spreads on the individual bonds in those ETFs.\\nVanguard bond ETF trading volumes and spreads in the past year\\nNote: Data cover June 2021 through May 2022.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nIt\\'s all in the planning\\nAs we emphasized in our previous article, As ETFs rise, it\\'s time to hone your ETF trading strategies, large trades can be quite complex and, if mishandled, can create negative consequences for advisors and client portfolios. That\\'s why careful planning, which can improve execution and limit transaction costs, is paramount each time you approach a relatively large trade.\\nTLH trades can often be large and require what we call \"high-touch\" trades.3 We recommend using high-touch trades if the trade size exceeds both 5% of average daily trading volume and the quoted size available on the bid/offer.\\nIf that\\'s the case, consider whether your order is large enough to result in the creation or redemption of ETF shares, and consider working with your custodian\\'s block trading desk.4 If the order is relatively modest in size and you don\\'t need to work with your custodian\\'s block trading desk, you may want to consider a low-touch order such as a limit order or a marketable limit order. Marketable limit orders are ones priced for immediate execution.5\\nOne useful trading technique that could potentially make pursuing the same TLH opportunity across numerous client ETF portfolios more efficient is ETF order aggregation. In our experience, order aggregation can make sense for institutional clients and for advisors that are implementing TLH across numerous client accounts, if your firm\\'s technology can support it.\\nThe power of switch trades\\nMoreover, if the TLH trade is large enough and could result in the creation and redemption of ETF shares, a “switch trade” strategy might be a good idea. A switch trade involves working with your custodian’s block desk to put multiple market makers in competition for the packaged ETF trade, meaning both the selling and the buying of the ETF shares in question. In other words, the sell order and buy order are done at the same time instead of being handled as two separate risk trades.\\nIf the ETF being sold (ETF A) has a high correlation to the ETF being purchased (ETF B), a market maker can redeem ETF A and use the basket of securities they receive to create ETF B.\\nThe switch trade results in the market maker having fewer transaction costs, which get passed through in the form of better execution quality for end-clients.\\nAnd the bigger the trade, the more a switch trade strategy makes sense.\\nVanguard\\'s ETF Capital Markets team is available to assist with trading and execution throughout the decision-making process, increasing the likelihood of successful outcomes. If you\\'d like to discuss any of the topics in this article on behalf of your practice and clients, consider reaching out to our Capital Markets Desk.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Year to date through May 31, 2022, the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index returned –14.19%, the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index returned –20.98%, and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index returned –9.05%.\\n2 The wash-sale rule prohibits selling an investment at a loss and replacing it with the same or a \"substantially identical\" investment 30 days before or after the sale. If you have a wash sale, the IRS prohibits writing off the investment loss.\\n3 High-touch orders come in different forms. Risk trades are done with a market maker at a negotiated price for a block of ETF shares, where the market maker commits capital to facilitate the client’s order immediately. Such trades generally occur at a slight premium or discount to the quoted spread (the National Best Bid/Offer) at the time of the trade. Algorithmic trades use automated algorithms to try to achieve specific outcomes. These are generally executed over a period of time and intended to minimize price impact in the market.\\n4 ETFs are created and redeemed in unit sizes. Generally, the minimum to facilitate a creation or redemption is 25,000 ETF shares, but creation unit size can vary by product.\\n5 Vanguard\\'s ETF Capital Markets Desk typically suggests that investors consider using limit orders or marketable limit orders to avoid any unexpected ETF executions. In our view, marketable limit orders may represent the best of both worlds in that executions are quick and include safeguards that market orders lack.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or ETF Shares, contact your financial advisor to obtain a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus.

       "  'content': '\"The first half of the year was a rough time for bond investors, with prices falling as yields climbed,\" said Matt Sheridan, senior investment consultant with Vanguard Portfolio Analytics and Consulting.\\nBond prices may not matter as much as your clients think they do\\n\"While swift bond price declines are upsetting to clients,\" Sheridan said, \"it\\'s important to remain focused on the long-term benefits of higher rates.\"\\nBond total returns have two main components: price return and return from income. Changes to interest rates cause these two components to move in opposite directions. Medium- to long-term investors should care more about bond total returns instead of the negative short-term impact on bond prices. In fact, as we show in the chart, the long-term performance of bond investments has come mostly from income return, not price return.\\nPrice return and total return for U.S. aggregate bonds\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nNotes: Monthly data are from December 31, 1999, to May 31, 2022. U.S. aggregate bonds are represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index in USD. All bond income is assumed to be reinvested. Income return is the reinvestment of coupons and compound interest on the reinvestment.\\nSource: Bloomberg.\\n\\nWhy bond bear markets are fundamentally different from stock bear markets\\nFor bond investors, the price return component’s effect on total return decreases as time extends. For stock investors, the price return component of total return is much more significant. \"The Lost Decade\" is a great example of this: From January 2000 through December 2009, the total annualized return for the S&P 500 was –0.95%, inclusive of the reinvestment of dividends. The negative price returns caused by the bear markets of 2000–2002 and 2007–2009 had an immense impact on long-term returns.\\nNow take the bond bear market of the 1970s, which was seen as a terrible time to have been invested in bonds as both inflation and nominal interest rates were soaring. But consider this: Long-term bond investors who reinvested their income returns, and remained patient as compounding took hold, nearly doubled their capital from 1976–1983. Over the longer term, bond total returns are driven much more by reinvestment of interest income and compounding than by price returns. \"Investors need to look beyond the immediate pain of losses appearing in their quarterly bond portfolio statements to the longer-term upside of rising interest rates,\" Sheridan said.\\nInterest income and reinvestment account for the largest portion of total return in bond funds\\nBond investing in the 1970s and early 1980s\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nNotes: For this example, we assume that an investor fully funded a $100,000 investment in the Barclay\\'s Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (now Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index) on January 1, 1976. We do not account for any expenses or taxes. Interest-on-interest return is calculated as the remainder after subtracting both income and capital returns from the total return.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations based on capital, income, and total return data reported by Barclay\\'s Capital.\\n\\nBond math holds up even during fixed income shocks\\nConsider short-term Treasuries: interest-rate-sensitive securities whose total returns are extremely sensitive to central bank policy changes. As interest rates on the short end of the Treasury curve have risen due to expectations of further Federal Reserve policy adjustments, so too has the weighted average yield to maturity for funds that invest in these securities. That provides a better foundation to help weather further rate shocks as starting yields are now much higher. Even if rates were to rise an additional 200 basis points (bps) from here, you would now recoup any lost principal within a year and then benefit from higher yields moving forward—ultimately increasing the long-term value of your bond portfolios (see chart).\\nThat means the time to recoup your capital from an interest rate shock depends on your starting yield. A 200 bp rate shock from a 50 bp starting yield will take longer to break even when compared to a 200 bp rate shock from a 250 bp starting yield.\\n\"The bottom line is that as rates move higher, bonds are more attractive, not less,\" Sheridan said.\\nThe silver lining in rising rates\\nHypothetical impact of changes in interest rates\\nNotes: This hypothetical example begins with a portfolio value of $100,000 and does not represent the return on any particular investment. \"No change\" yields are based on a starting yield of 3%. For simplicity, duration was assumed to remain at two years, but in practice, as yields change, duration also changes. Such a dramatic change in yields, as this example assumes, would likely constitute a rather significant adjustment to a portfolio\\'s weighted average duration. For purposes of illustration, we assumed no change to yields in subsequent years. Yields are not guaranteed.\\nSource: Vanguard.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'A new Vanguard research paper highlights the fact that almost double the projected number of Americans retired during the pandemic. Some may be forced to reenter the workforce as they have not accumulated enough assets to last through retirement. The authors discuss their ongoing research to find viable solutions to address the retirement income gap, which may only get wider.\\n\\xa0\\n\"During the pandemic, some 1.6 million older workers left the labor force earlier than expected,\" said Andrew S. Clarke, principal of Vanguard Investment Strategy Group\\'s retirement team and one of three authors of The Great Retirement? Or the Great Sabbatical?\\n\"For those in the top deciles in wealth, early retirement is manageable. For those with less assets, it\\'s not. Although the latter represent a small portion of the population, their pandemic behavior raises provocative questions about American workers\\' prospects of financing life after labor.\"\\nHow can those who retired earlier than expected address asset shortfalls during retirement?\\nThis question takes on greater urgency in the current environment, said Fu Tan, investment research analyst and coauthor of the paper. \"Our research drew on data through 2021. Obviously, the drop in market value of retirement assets and spiking inflation since then will make it more pressing for some earlier-than-expected retirees to return to work. Our analysis demonstrates that a few extra years of employment can greatly enhance retirement security.\"\\nBut what about those who can\\'t return to work or may still not have enough income?\\nThere are several additional options to consider.\\nModifying the replacement ratio\\nOne of the most common rules of thumb regarding retirement income is the replacement ratio—the amount of preretirement income that needs to be replaced in retirement.\\nVanguard\\'s research assumes a target replacement ratio of 79%, consistent with assumptions in many research models. But retirees have some flexibility in how much of their preretirement income to replace.\\n\"Model stress tests and empirical research suggest a wide range of replacement ratios,\" Tan said. \"If an expected replacement ratio of 80% includes significant discretionary spending, those whose assets look a little lean might be able to finance retirement with a lower replacement ratio.\"\\nAnother guideline that can be reevaluated, particularly in this market environment, is the 4% withdrawal rate. Vanguard\\'s research suggests a rate of about 3% is a more realistic figure given current inflation and muted expected returns for both stocks and bonds, Clarke said.\\n\"It\\'s important to keep in mind that, ultimately, these are all just rules of thumb,\" Clarke said. \"There are too many variables with market conditions and each individual\\'s circumstances to reduce a solution to one number for everyone.\"\\nThese rules also ignore another potential source of income for retirees—the four walls that surround them.\\nUntapped equity: The home\\nAbout 80% of Americans 65 and older are homeowners, and housing wealth accounts for 40% of their net worth. Preliminary Vanguard research spotlights one strategy these retirees have used to extract equity from their homes.\\n\"We find that many homeowners 60 and older tap into housing wealth by moving to a cheaper place,\" Clarke said. \"They bolster their retirement security with such moves in two ways. First, by moving to a new location with a lower house price, they seamlessly liquidate some of their housing wealth. Second, they also benefit from settling in a new location with a lower cost of living.\"\\nMore guidance needed\\nThe onus should not be just on the individual to figure this out.\\n\"What\\'s clear is that the picture has gotten more complex for all, whether individual investors, advisors, consultants, or plan sponsors,\" Clarke said. \"There\\'s no consensus even among experts on next best steps, so we shouldn\\'t expect the average person to judge their best route to a secure retirement.\\n\"Advisors may want to check in with their clients to see if their goals and circumstances have changed and provide counsel. Plan sponsors might want to reevaluate their participant education and support programs to ensure their employees remain on track to meet retirement goals. Plan providers and researchers must take into account how the shifting dynamics in the financial and labor markets affect the assumptions used in their models. At Vanguard, we\\'re doing research and modeling that can set the most appropriate goalposts in our ever-changing environment.\"'},\n",

       "  'content': 'At the start of the year, we expected global economies to continue to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic but at a more modest pace than in 2021. While that holds true, the pace of change in macroeconomic fundamentals such as inflation, growth, and monetary policy has failed to live up to expectations.\\nLabor and supply-chain constraints were already fueling inflation before the year began, but Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine and China\\'s zero-COVID policy exacerbated the situation. Central banks have been forced to play catchup in the fight against inflation, ratcheting up interest rates more rapidly and possibly higher than previously expected. But those actions risk cooling economies to the point that they enter recession.\\n\"Global economic growth will likely stay positive this year, but some economies are flirting with recession, if not this year, then in 2023,\" said Andrew Patterson, Vanguard senior international economist.\\nCompared with the start of the year, Vanguard has downgraded its 2022 GDP growth forecasts for all the major regions, increased its inflation forecasts, and become more hawkish about monetary policy.\\nExpected 10-year asset-class returns have risen\\nStock and bond markets have been hit hard so far in 2022.

We expect the equivalent of 12 to 14 rate hikes of 25 basis points for the full year, with the target federal funds rates landing in the 3.25%–3.75% range by year-end. We expect a terminal rate of at least 4% in 2023—higher than what we consider to be the neutral rate (2.5%) and above what\\'s currently being priced into the market. (The neutral rate is the theoretical rate at which monetary policy neither stimulates nor restricts an economy.)\\nWe have downgraded expected U.S. GDP growth from about 3.5% at the start of the year to about 1.5%. The factors that led to our downgrade will likely continue through 2022—namely, tightening financial conditions, wages not keeping up with inflation, and lack of demand for U.S. exports. Labor market trends are likely to keep downward pressure on the unemployment rate through year-end, though increases in 2023 are likely as the impacts of Fed policy and slowing demand take hold. We assess the probability of recession at about 25% over the next 12 months and 65% over 24 months. We believe that a period of high inflation and stagnating growth is more likely than an economic \"soft landing\" of growth and unemployment rates around or above longer-term equilibrium levels (about 2% for growth and 4% for unemployment).\\nEuro area\\nIn the euro area, headline inflation driven by high energy prices may spike to above 10% in the third quarter. Inflation has become widespread, spurring the European Central Bank into what it expects will be a \"sustained path\" of interest rate increases. In September, rates will likely be out of negative territory for the first time in a decade. We forecast economic growth to be about 2% to 3% for the full year. However, Europe\\'s dependence on Russian natural gas and the challenges of managing monetary policy for 19 countries put the euro area at a higher risk of recession than the United States in the next 12 months. A complete cutoff from Russian gas would likely lead to rationing and recession. We assess the probability of recession around 50% over 12 months and 60% over 24 months.\\nChina\\nChina will fall far short of policymakers\\' growth target of about 5.5%, given that it\\'s a challenge to achieve all three of their goals: the growth target, financial stability, and a zero-COVID policy. (The latter affects not just China\\'s economy, but the global economy as well.) We believe the actual 2022 GDP growth rate will be just above 3%, far below China\\'s pace for many years. Given China\\'s zero-COVID policy, additional outbreaks resulting in renewed lockdowns could further detract from growth. That said, recession is unlikely, with probability at 30% over 12 months and 35% over 24 months.\\nEmerging markets\\nWe recently downgraded our forecast for full-year 2022 growth in emerging markets, from about 5.5% at the start of the year to about 3%. Emerging markets continue to face headwinds from slowing growth in the United States, the euro area, and China, as well as from developed markets\\' central bank tightening and from domestic and global inflation. Although higher commodities prices do benefit some emerging economies, they\\'re a negative in the aggregate.\\nProbability of recession for select regions\\nSource: Vanguard, as of July 7, 2022.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nVanguard forecasts as of June 30, 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nEconomic growth\\nHeadline inflation\\nMonetary policy\\nUnemployment rate\\n\\n\\nUnited States\\n~1.5%\\n7%–7.5%\\n3.25%–3.75%\\n3%–3.5%\\n\\n\\nCanada\\n~4%\\n~6.5%\\n~3%\\n~5.5%\\n\\n\\nMexico\\n~2%\\n~5%\\n8%–9%\\n~3.5%\\n\\n\\nEuro area\\n2%–3%\\n~8%–8.5%\\n0.5%–0.75%\\n~7%\\n\\n\\nUnited Kingdom\\n3.5%–4%\\n~10%\\n2.25%–2.5%\\n~4%\\n\\n\\nChina\\n~3%\\n<2.5%\\n2.75%\\n~5.5%\\n\\n\\nAustralia\\n3%–3.5%\\n~7%\\n~2.5%\\n~4%\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes: Forecasts evolve with new data, and our views will inevitably change. Growth is the change in annualized GDP year over year. Inflation is the headline consumer price index, which includes the volatile food and energy sectors. Monetary policy is our year-end projection for the central bank’s short-term interest rate target.\\nSource: Vanguard forecasts as of June 30, 2022.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIs inflation inevitable?\\nPersistent inflation has several economies, including the U.S., edging closer to recession. In this short video, Vanguard’s chief economist says four conditions need to be met to avoid that path.\\n\\nJoe Davis: Inflation is at generational highs, and many are concerned about the threat of recession. So, what\\'s Vanguard\\'s view?\\nOur own economic projections now indicate a greater than 50% probability of a recession occurring over the next 12 to 18 months, both in the United States and other developed markets, in particular Europe.\\nWhy the increased odds of recession? Well, now we have two forces pushing on inflation. The well-documented supply constraints of food and energy and other products leading to higher costs of living for many consumers and businesses. And the second force, which we have long documented—the tight labor market pushing up wage pressures, which also contribute to higher inflation for a number of products and services.\\nNow, greater than 50% odds are not 100%, and recession is not a foregone conclusion. So, what would it take for the U.S. economy and other markets to avoid a recession, a scenario that is not fully priced by the financial markets? Well, in my mind, there are four.\\nFor the Federal Reserve, respectfully, I would strongly urge moving short-term interest rates to 3% before the end of the summer. That would help tamp down inflation expectations, which have started to creep up given the recent experience of high inflation.\\nWe would need to see commodity prices fall further from here. Say, perhaps, oil below $100 a barrel— which, if that would occur, would fully offset the rise in food prices, which have also been material over the past 12 months for most consumers.\\nIf we would see inventories rebuild as they have been doing over the past several months, that would potentially provide some modest price relief, and that is critical to bring down headline inflation, which is north of 8.5%.\\nAnd then, finally, we need to see a little bit of luck on labor supply. And, indeed, we would need to see at least one million Americans more join the labor force over the summer. That would help better balance the strong demand for labor with the lack of supply. And that would provide still-heady wage growth, but perhaps at a slightly lower rate and yet still ahead of the rate of cost of living, should we see these three other conditions met.\\nSo, four conditions to avoid recession. And, unfortunately, I don\\'t view this as a multiple-choice exam, and in fact we would need to see all four met for the U.S. economy and other markets to avoid recession.\\nSo, bottom line: Soft landings, which is the goal of many central banks; soft landings are rare, and they\\'re rarer than recessions. And should the U.S. economy and other markets fall into recession, that will be unfortunate, although it will not spell the end of economic growth in the future.\\nThe path of the recovery, it has certainly narrowed. But the road isn\\'t blocked just yet, and in the months ahead we will have a better sense of where the economy unfolds.\\nImportant information:\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.\\n© 2022 The Vanguard Group, Inc.

       "  'content': 'John Galloway, Vanguard\\'s global head of investment stewardship, discusses how the team addresses environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks at portfolio companies that can affect long-term shareholder value.\\nHow does Vanguard define investment stewardship—and why is it important?\\nGalloway: Investment stewardship is the primary mechanism Vanguard uses to safeguard and promote the long-term value and investment returns of investors in our internally managed equity funds. Our program is guided by Vanguard\\'s core purpose: to take a stand for all investors, to treat them fairly, and to give them the best chance for investment success.\\nOur activities involve researching, identifying, and advocating for strong corporate governance practices that have a link to long-term shareholder value. We publicly advocate for the highest standards of corporate governance worldwide; we engage, or hold discussions, with company boards and management teams to share our expectations of best governance practices and understand how companies look after shareholder value; and ultimately, we vote proxies at shareholder meetings on behalf of the funds. It\\'s important to note that, by the nature of our index funds, we do not dictate company strategy or look to influence operational decisions. We\\'re focused squarely on questions of good governance and effective oversight of risks that could affect shareholder value.\\nWhat do you look for as hallmarks of good corporate governance?\\nGalloway: Vanguard\\'s Investment Stewardship program is grounded in four global principles of good governance. First, a company\\'s board of directors is responsible for representing our (and other shareholders\\') interests, so a board\\'s composition and effectiveness are critically important. Second, a board is responsible for oversight of company strategy and its material risks. Third, executive compensation should be linked to long-term performance and structured to incentivize a company\\'s outperformance of its peers. Fourth, shareholder rights—the ability of Vanguard and other investors to appropriately use our voice and our vote to safeguard and promote shareholder value—need to be robust and protected.\\nOur portfolio companies operate under different regulatory environments and region-specific norms that are evolving at different paces. It\\'s important that we understand those differences. Our four global principles are applied consistently, but regional nuances help inform our expectations and approach to specific companies.\\nHow much time is spent on environmental- or social-focused shareholder proposals versus the general governance practices of companies?\\nGalloway: Given that shareholder proposals that focus on different environmental or social issues are often the ones you read about in the news, many people may be surprised to learn that those constitute a very small percentage of the 170,000-odd individual proxy ballot items that the stewardship team votes on each year for the Vanguard funds. Over the last two decades, governance practices in developed markets have matured to a point where there is general agreement on the linkage between shareholder value and things like a well-composed board, effective and independent auditors, and executive compensation structures that are aligned to shareholder value. So the bulk of our time is spent engaging with companies and their boards about these governance practices. That said, we also dedicate resources to analyzing how boards oversee new and emerging material environmental and social matters that have the potential to enhance or detract from shareholder value over time.\\nEnvironmental and social shareholder proposals make up a small percentage of our voting activity\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow does investment stewardship differ for index funds versus actively managed funds?\\nGalloway: By design, an index fund holds the stocks in a market index and is an investor in those companies for as long as the companies are included in the benchmark index. An index fund does not have the option of divesting or buying more or less of a stock than is represented in the index, regardless of our own views of the strength of a company\\'s corporate governance practices. We view this as an opportunity, not a limitation, as we believe in the power of active engagement. We promote and safeguard value for index fund investors by engaging with company boards and leaders to share our perspectives on good governance practices. And when necessary, we use our vote to hold boards accountable for failures of risk oversight, or to encourage the adoption of shareholder proposals that we believe are in the best long-term interests of shareholders.\\nWe approach our engagements as ongoing conversations with companies over months and years. Our portfolio companies know we are not focused on the next quarter or year, but on long-term shareholder value that spans years and decades.\\nIn an actively managed fund, where a portfolio manager can buy or sell stocks in pursuit of outperforming a benchmark index, the investment stewardship levers of voting and engagement serve as additional ways for the manager to express perspectives to a company on behalf of fund investors.1\\nWhat global governance trends stood out over the last year?\\nGalloway: We saw continued focus on how companies are responding to climate change risk. Particularly in Europe and the U.K., but also in the U.S., these concerns took on some new flavors, such as companies adopting or receiving \"Say on Climate\" proposals that encourage companies to disclose climate-related risks, targets, and transition plans.\\nHeightened attention to risks associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, was another key trend. Investors continue to focus on how companies are ensuring that their board, management teams, and workforce reflect appropriate levels of diversity. We see more companies providing enhanced disclosures of their workforce diversity statistics, their strategy to address DEI-related risks, and progress on their efforts. Calls for third-party racial equity audits, or social justice audits, also gained prominence on the ballots of U.S. public companies during 2021, and we see that trend continuing in the early 2022 proxy season.\\nOne last trend I\\'ll highlight is the continued focus on company corporate political activity disclosures to help investors identify any risk of misalignment between a company\\'s stated long-term strategy and its lobbying activities.\\nLearn more about Vanguard Investment Stewardship, its global corporate governance principles, and its perspectives.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Investment stewardship for Vanguard’s externally managed active funds is carried out by those funds’ investment advisors, who integrate their stewardship principles with their investment processes.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.\\nDiversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Periodically, pundits declare the death of the 60% stock/40% bond portfolio. Their voices have grown louder lately, amid sharp declines in both stock and bond prices. But we\\'ve been here before. Based on history, balanced portfolios are apt to prove the naysayers wrong, again.\\nApproaching the midpoint of 2022, market, economic, and geopolitical conditions all appear fraught. Inflation is hitting 40-year highs, the Federal Reserve is sharply reversing monetary policy, the pandemic hasn\\'t gone away, and supply chain woes have been exacerbated by COVID-19 lockdowns in China and Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, with the latter putting the Western bloc the closest to a war footing in decades.\\nNot surprisingly, this perfect storm of negative market drivers has pushed stock and bond prices south in lockstep, impairing the normal diversification of risks in a balanced portfolio.\\nStock-bond diversification in historical context\\nBrief, simultaneous declines in stocks and bonds are not unusual, as our chart shows. Viewed monthly since early 1976, the nominal total returns of both U.S. stocks and investment-grade bonds have been negative nearly 15% of the time. That\\'s a month of joint declines every seven months or so, on average.\\nExtend the time horizon, however, and joint declines have struck less frequently. Over the last 46 years, investors never encountered a three-year span of losses in both asset classes.\\nHistorically, stock-bond diversification recovers within a few months\\nSource: Vanguard.\\nData reflect rolling period total returns for the periods shown and are based on underlying monthly total returns for the period from February 1976 through April 2022. The S&P 500 Index and the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index were used as proxies for stocks and bonds.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAs our chart shows, drawdowns in 60% stock/40% bond portfolios have occurred more regularly than simultaneous declines in stocks and bonds. This is due to the far-higher volatility of stocks and their greater weight in that asset mix. One-month total returns were negative one-third of the time over the last 46 years. The one-year returns of such portfolios were negative about 14% of the time, or once every seven years or so, on average.\\nBut we need to remind ourselves of the purpose of the traditional balanced portfolio.\\nThe math behind 60/40 portfolios\\nCatchy phrases like the \"death of 60/40\" are easy to remember, don\\'t require complex explanations, and may even seem to have a ring of truth in the difficult market environment we are in today. But such statements ignore basic facts of investing, focus on short-term performance, and create a dangerous disincentive for investors to remain disciplined about their long-term goals.\\nKeep in mind:\\n\\nThe goal of the 60/40 portfolio is to achieve long-term annualized returns of roughly 7%. This is meant to be achieved over time and on average, not each and every year. The annualized return of 60% U.S. stock and 40% U.S. bond portfolio from January 1, 1926, through December 31, 2021, was 8.8%.1 Going forward, the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM) projects the long-term average return to be around 7% for the 60/40 portfolio. Market volatility means diversified portfolio returns will always remain uneven, comprising periods of higher or lower—and, yes, even negative—returns. IMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the VCMM regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. Distribution of return outcomes from VCMM are derived from 10,000 simulations for each modeled asset class. Simulations as of April 30, 2022. Results from the model may vary with each use and over time. For more information, please see the Notes section.\\nThe average return we expect can still be achieved if periods of negative returns (like this year) follow periods of high returns. During the three previous years (2019–2021), a 60/40 portfolio delivered an annualized 14.3% return, so losses of up to –12% for all of 2022 would just bring the four-year annualized return to 7%, back in line with historical norms.1\\nOn the flip side, the math of average returns suggests that periods of negative returns must be followed by years with higher-than-average returns. Indeed, with the painful market adjustments year-to-date, the return outlook for the 60/40 portfolio has improved, not declined. Driven by lower equity valuations, the VCMM’s projected 10-year returns for U.S. stocks have increased by 1.3 percentage point since year-end 2021. And with higher interest rates, the VCMM’s projected 10-year U.S. bond returns have increased 1.6 percentage point from year-end 2021. Overall, the 10-year annualized average return outlook for the 60/40 is now higher by 1.3 percentage points than before the market adjustment.\\nMarket timing is extremely difficult even for professional investors and is doomed to fail as a portfolio strategy. Markets are incredibly efficient at quickly pricing unexpected news and shocks like the invasion of Ukraine or the accelerated and synchronized central bank response to global inflation. Chasing performance and reacting to headlines are doomed to fail as a timing strategy every time, since it amounts to buying high and selling low. Far from abandoning balanced portfolios, investors should keep their investment programs on track, adding to them in a disciplined way over time.\\n\\nNo magic in 60/40 but in balance and discipline\\nI\\'ve focused here on the 60/40 portfolio because of its touchstone status. In our view, 60/40 is a sound benchmark for an investment strategy designed to pursue moderate growth.\\nProminent and useful as a benchmark though it is, 60/40 is not magical. And talk of its demise is ultimately a distraction from the business of investing successfully over the long term.\\nThe broader, more important issue is the effectiveness of a diversified portfolio, balanced across asset classes, in keeping with the investor’s risk tolerance and time horizon. In that sense, \"60/40\" is a sort of shorthand for an investor’s strategic asset allocation, whatever the target mix.\\nFor some investors with a longer time horizon, the right strategic asset allocation mix may be more aggressive, 80/20 or even 90/10. For others, closer to retirement or more conservative-minded, 30/70 may do it. The suitability of alternative investments for a portfolio depends on the investor\\'s circumstances and preferences.\\nWhatever one calls a target asset mix and whatever one includes in the portfolio, successful investing over the long term demands perspective and long-term discipline. Stretches like the beginning of 2022—and some bear markets that have lasted much longer—test investors\\' patience.\\nThis isn\\'t the first time the 60/40 and the markets in general have faced difficulties—and it won\\'t be the last. Our models suggest that further economic travails lie ahead and that market returns will still be muted. But the 60/40 portfolio and its variations are not dead. Like the phoenix, the immortal bird of Greek mythology that regenerates from the ashes of its predecessor, the balanced portfolio will be reborn from the ashes of this market and continue rewarding those investors with the patience and discipline to stick with it.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Vanguard calculations using data from Standard & Poor’s, Dow Jones, MSCI, CRSP, Morningstar, and Bloomberg.

The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Despite recent volatility, Vanguard continues to view fixed income as a crucial diversifier for many investors. International bonds, in particular, historically have had low correlations with U.S. stocks and bonds. That\\'s one reason that more than three years ago, we introduced Vanguard Global Credit Bond Fund, an active fund that has delivered benchmark-beating returns since inception and is designed to be a building block for your clients\\' portfolios.\\nHow our Global Credit Bond Fund can serve your clients\\nVanguard Global Credit Bond Fund aims to provide a moderate and sustainable level of current income by investing in a diversified portfolio of global credit bonds. Like Vanguard Core Bond Fund and Vanguard Core Plus Bond Fund, which cover the U.S. bond market, Vanguard Global Credit Bond Fund offers:\\n\\nSingle-purchase exposure to a broad fixed income market.\\nLow costs.\\nSecurity selection that is true-to-label.\\nThe alpha (return that exceeds that of the benchmark) potential of active management.\\n\\nThe portfolio has only minimal exposure to non-dollar-denominated bonds, and any exposure to these bonds is fully hedged, enabling investors to be globally diversified without incurring the significant currency risk often involved in investing globally. Its holdings are largely made up of U.S. corporate, European corporate, and high-quality sovereign emerging markets bonds. The fund can also invest in below-investment-grade corporates and emerging markets securities when they\\'re attractive, but only to a limited extent to keep the portfolio high quality.\\nIts diversification and high-quality bias make it suited to fill a couple of roles in a portfolio:\\n\\nA core allocation within a fixed income portfolio.\\nA complementary holding to add greater diversification to a fixed income portfolio or provide a tilt toward the credit sector.\\n\\nThe bottom line—Relative performance\\nA disciplined approach to risk, coupled with Vanguard Fixed Income Group\\'s ability to choose instruments across regions, subsectors, and yield curves in the credit universe, has resulted in a strong track record for this fund.\\nFrom its inception on November 15, 2018, through March 31, 2022, the fund returned a cumulative 17.73% for Admiral™ Shares, outperforming both the 12.43% return of its benchmark index, the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Credit Index (USD Hedged), as well as the average return of 7.82% for its peer group.\\n\"That\\'s a meaningful degree of outperformance in fixed income given that yields across the globe are still near historical lows,\" said John Croke, head of active fixed income product management.Vanguard Global Credit Bond Fund has consistently outperformed its benchmark and peer-group average\\nAnnualized returns as of March 31, 2022\\n\\n\\n\\nFund name\\nInception\\nExpense ratio\\n1 year\\n3 years\\nSince fund inception\\n\\n\\nVanguard Global Credit Bond Fund Admiral Shares\\n11/15/2018\\n0.25%\\n–4.04%\\n3.53%\\n4.96%\\n\\n\\n\\nBloomberg Global Aggregate Credit Index (USD Hedged)\\n\\n01/16/2001\\n—\\n–4.90%\\n2.12%\\n3.54%\\n\\n\\nGlobal Income Funds Average\\n—\\n0.87%\\n–5.51%\\n1.22%\\n2.26%\\n\\n\\n\\nThe performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results.

The management team obviously didn\\'t anticipate the coronavirus pandemic, but its conservative positioning allowed for adding risk as the market sold off. That wasn\\'t the case for some of our competitors, who were carrying more risk ahead of the pandemic, chasing a few extra basis points of potential return despite elevated valuations.\\nHow the management team added value\\nNote: Data are for April 2019 through March 2022.\\nSources: Vanguard and Bloomberg.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOur management team reduced risk in early 2021 once bonds had rebounded from the initial COVID-19 sell-off and valuations seemed high—much like the beginning of 2020—before it added a little risk through emerging-markets bonds later in the year.\\nThat movement out of and into and risk drove the fund\\'s strong relative performance.\\nGlobal credit bond funds hedged in U.S. dollars have tended to show little correlation with U.S. stocks over the past 15 years, according to data from Morningstar, Inc.1 And they have experienced smaller drawdowns than U.S. credit bond funds over the same period.\\nAnd, of course, the fund benefits from Vanguard\\'s hallmark, low costs. With an expense ratio of 0.25%, the fund\\'s Admiral share class was ranked in the 98th percentile on an expense-ratio basis for global income funds as of December 31, 2021, according to Lipper, Inc., a Thomson Reuters company.

       "  'content': \"With rising interest rates and inflation dominating the headlines, are your clients considering a shift in their portfolio allocation strategy? You likely also have clients who are locked into a home bias, not realizing how much this lack of diversification can cost them over the long term. Is international investing worth a look? There are some excellent reasons to consider an allocation to investments outside of the U.S.\\nFinancial markets around the world change rapidly in response to news and events, and by avoiding international stocks your clients are excluding a large portion of the global opportunity set. In fact, international stocks, represent almost 44% of the global market—a figure too large to ignore.1\\nRecent extreme market volatility can afford you the chance to help clients redeploy their capital in order to help them achieve their long-term financial goals. Here are four reasons to embrace global investing.\\n\\nChanging market leadership\\n\\nThe rationale for diversification is clear—U.S. and international stocks often swap positions as performance leaders. What might the future hold as leaders potentially turn to laggards? Global diversification gives you a chance to participate in whatever region is outperforming at a given time.\\nHere you will see how stock market leadership has alternated in the past between the U.S. and international markets. Rather than choosing one region over another based on past performance, consider focusing on the long-term benefits of a global approach.\\nTrailing 12-month return differential between U.S. and non-U.S. stocks\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nNotes: U.S. equities are represented by MSCI USA Index; international equities are represented by MSCI All Country World Index ex USA.

While we believe the price/earnings ratios for stocks are some of the best indicators of future returns, we also recognize that you must take into account valuations from a fair-value standpoint, factoring in global economic and market changes.\\nBased on these valuations, the expected return outlook for non-U.S. stocks over the next 10 years is higher than that for U.S. stocks.\\nGlobal non-U.S. equity annualized returns\\n(in U.S. dollars)\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results.\\nDistribution of return outcomes from the VCMM are derived from 10,000 simulations for each modeled asset class.

Of course it's natural to be concerned about geopolitical risk, but having a mix of U.S. and international equities can actually reduce portfolio risk.\\nThe maximum volatility reduction benefit of adding an allocation to international equities occurs between the 20%–50% range.\\nChange in portfolio volatility when including non-U.S. stocks in a U.S. portfolio, 1970–2020\\nNotes: Non-U.S. equities are represented by MSCI World Index ex USA and U.S. stocks are represented by the MSCI USA Index from March 31, 1970, through March 31, 2020.

In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.\\nESG funds are subject to ESG investment risk, which is the chance that the stocks or bonds screened by the index provider for ESG criteria generally will underperform the market as a whole or, in the aggregate, will trail returns of other funds screened for ESG criteria. The index provider’s assessment of a company, based on the company’s level of involvement in a particular industry or the index provider’s own ESG criteria, may differ from that of other funds or of the advisor’s or an investor’s assessment of such company.\\xa0 As a result, the companies deemed eligible by the index provider may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics.\\xa0 The evaluation of companies for ESG screening or integration is dependent on the timely and accurate\\xa0 reporting of ESG data by the companies. Successful application of the screens will depend on the index provider’s proper identification and analysis of ESG data.\\nInvestors cannot invest directly in an index. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.\\nInvestments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk. These risks are especially high in emerging markets. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Prices of mid- and small-cap stocks often fluctuate more than those of large-company stocks.\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. VCMM results will vary with each use and over time.\\nThe VCMM projections are based on a statistical analysis of historical data. Future returns may behave differently from the historical patterns captured in the VCMM. More important, the VCMM may be underestimating extreme negative scenarios unobserved in the historical period on which the model estimation is based.\\nThe Vanguard Capital Markets Model is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguard’s primary investment research and advice teams. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time.

       "  'content': 'In the rapidly changing environment that has characterized 2022 so far, we have downgraded our forecasts for GDP growth for the United States and China and revised our views on inflation and monetary policy for the euro area. But we believe these economies will likely avoid a recession this year, and our forecast for Federal Reserve policy is unchanged.\\n\"We\"ll see slower growth going forward because of a myriad of factors,\" said Andrew Patterson, Vanguard senior international economist. \"But our views on macro fundamentals are changing in regard to magnitude, not in direction.\"\\nUnited States: Slower but continued growth\\nWe\\'ve revised our outlook for full-year U.S. GDP growth to roughly 2%, down from around 3.5% at the start of the year.1 Three factors that will likely persist through 2022 drive our downgrade:\\nFinancial conditions have tightened to a level that likely restricts growth. Most of the tightening has come through higher lending rates. Falling equity markets have also contributed. We believe conditions have tightened significantly more than what\\'s implied by the market\\'s current pricing of future federal funds rate increases. Hikes eventually might even go beyond the neutral policy rate (when the Fed\\'s key interest rate would neither stimulate nor restrict the economy), which we currently see as around 2.5%.\\nIncomes aren\\'t keeping pace with inflation, a drag on what have been solid consumer fundamentals. We believe that wage growth will remain elevated but will only catch up to levels of core inflation late in 2022, and will continue to lag headline inflation, which includes the effects of volatile food and energy prices.\\nThe foreign demand outlook has deteriorated. The war in Ukraine is hurting European economies, and persistent COVID-19 outbreaks have caused growth in China to fall well below trend. We expect U.S. net trade to be pressured as a result. A 1.5% U.S. GDP contraction in the first quarter was in no small part driven by a reduction in net trade, as exports declined and imports increased.2 The simple math of the unexpected first-quarter decline in U.S. GDP puts downward pressure on full-year GDP.\\n\"We\\'re tempering expectations about growth, but that doesn\\'t materially change our views about the labor market or inflation at this point,\" Patterson said. More moderate growth will keep the unemployment rate from falling below 3% in the near term, and high labor demand should normalize more rapidly. We continue to expect that inflation will remain elevated but falling, supported by healthy demand, a tight labor market, and supply constraints that will linger throughout the year. Persistently elevated energy prices have grown as an additional risk factor, and we will monitor that closely.\\n\"The growth rate also doesn\\'t change our view on Fed monetary policy for what remains of 2022,\" he added. Vanguard expects the federal funds rate to increase another 100 to 150 basis points (bps), on top of the 75 bps earlier in the year. The rate hikes will come alongside a reduction in the Fed\\'s balance sheet.\\nEurope: Spiking inflation means higher rate hikes\\nThe story is a bit different in the euro area.\\n\"Our European economists are anticipating more interest rate hikes in 2022 than originally forecasted,\" Patterson said. \"The European Central Bank (ECB) is now more focused on fighting inflation, which is spiking into double-digit territory on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\"\\nThe changing picture for Europe.\\nEurope is slowing down, but recession isn\\'t likely unless Russian natural gas imports end. Euro area growth will likely be around 2.5%, lower than Vanguard\\'s forecast of around 4% at the start of the year. Recession is not likely this calendar year unless there is a hard stop to Russian gas imports.\\nAnnualized headline CPI is tracking above 15% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Vanguard has increased its inflation forecast for the full year to an average of 7.5% to 8%, up from our earlier 6.5%–7% forecast. Spikes in prices for food and energy are the most acute drivers, but inflation has become broader across sectors, especially in services.\\nThe ECB has acknowledged the changing dynamics. Key officials have been signaling more openness to aggressive rate hikes.\\nWe now forecast 100 to 125 bps of rate hikes in 2022, higher than our previous forecast of 50 bps. As such, we expect the ECB\\'s key deposit rate to turn positive for the first time since 2011 and to end the year in a range of 0.5% to 0.75%.\\nWe expect the policy rate to be above neutral (around 1.5%) by the middle of next year and to reach 2.5% by year-end 2023. This is about 50 bps higher than what\\'s reflected in current bond market pricing.\\nChina: 2022 growth target is likely to be missed\\n\"We\\'re predicting a 2022 growth rate just above 3% for China, which is lower than consensus and considerably lower than the central government\\'s target of around 5.5%,\" Patterson said. \"Obviously that\\'s still a healthy growth rate, but for China, that will feel like a recession from what they\\'re used to.\"\\nThe factors driving the downgrade.\\nChina\\'s zero-COVID policy has had a significant impact. Economic indicators have been weaker than expected in the second quarter, driven by the COVID-19 lockdowns; this will weigh down the full-year forecast. However, we anticipate that May was the trough.\\nDon\\'t expect a repeat of the 2021 recovery. Although China should recover during the second half of 2022, it will not be anywhere close to the robust pace seen in the second half of last year. There are too many headwinds offsetting anticipated stimulus.\\nFuture COVID outbreaks can\\'t be discounted. More pressing is that China’s continuing zero-COVID policy will mean that any future outbreaks will dampen economic activity.\\nOur revised forecast for the full year is a downgrade from the 5% we anticipated at the start of the year. It\\'s also lower than consensus views that generally range from 4% to 5%.\\nImpact on global economy and Fed monetary policies\\nAlthough global recession is unlikely, things are in flux and the Federal Reserve will be watching indicators carefully in forming future monetary policy. The chart reflects Vanguard\\'s modeling on how aggressive the Fed would be in hiking short-term interest rates depending on various scenarios. For more information, see the Vanguard research paper Federal Monetary Policy: Is This Time Different? (PDF)\\nThe federal funds rate in select scenarios\\nNotes: This figure describes the Fed\\'s rate hike path under each scenario presented. The forecasts are obtained from Vanguard\\'s model estimates. A combination of model estimates and subjective analysis is used to estimate the forecasts\\' terminal rate and timing under each scenario.\\nSources: Adapted from Federal Monetary Policy: Is This Time Different? (PDF) Vanguard model estimates based on data from Refinitiv, Moody\\'s, and Bloomberg.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe Fed has to find a balance between reining in inflation and tempering the pressures of a tight labor market. Developments that weigh heavily on economic activity would likely cause the Fed to slow its pace of rate hikes.\\nLike the Fed, Vanguard will be closely monitoring this ever-changing situation.\\n\"We\\'re always revisiting our views in any economic environment, but the fact that we\\'re revising so many of our global perspectives now speaks to the uncertainty underlying today\\'s environment, given the risks surrounding geopolitics, policies, and supply chains,\" Patterson said.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nInsights on the current market environment\\nCheck out our market volatility hub for the latest updates for you and your clients.View our insights\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n1 Measured on a Q4/Q4 percent-change basis.\\n2 Imports are subtracted from GDP because they reflect goods produced outside the United States.'},\n",

In these short, 2-minute videos you'll hear their thoughts on the recent market environment, maintaining their edge, and why they remain optimistic about the portfolio in the face of challenging, short-term performance.\\nYou'll also learn how Baillie Gifford views energy transition as a trend already benefitting the portfolio and something that they believe will be a key component moving forward.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do you stay optimistic when performance is challenging? What do you believe is the appropriate period to judge your performance?\\n\\nSo how do we maintain our optimism in the face of occasional, inevitable, sharp falls in the companies in which we invest?\\nI think optimism is a key component of what we do and something that deserves a bit of explanation. It is, I think, famously easier to sound clever by giving the pessimistic view, by pointing out why things will fail, why things don't work.\\nBut our optimism isn't frivolous or light. It's grounded in observation of human development over 250 years.\\xa0 If you look back to the period of human history since the Industrial Revolution, people's lives have gotten better and longer. Economies have grown. Societies have become more equal. And the driving force underpinning that is scientific progress. It's people searching for new and better ways of doing things and technology is developing, emerging, that allows the world to get better.\\nImagine you are in the work in the 2100s, look back to around the early 2020s and ask yourself, what was it that was happening that was really interesting around then?\\nAnd we see loads of things that are happening. New technological developments, a confluence of technologies emerging in computer science, in health care and biology, and in energy, that we think will drive radical new ways of the world working, of society, is developing. And that will provide the backdrop to good investment opportunities for us over the coming years.\\nThe second reason we are optimists, and deliberate optimists, comes down to the nature of financial markets, stock markets. Professor Hendrik Bessembinder at Arizona State has been foundational in helping us learn and think more about this aspect. And what Professor Bessembinder has shown is that long term stock market returns are driven by a very small number of outlier companies that generate extreme returns that are many, many times the level of return generated by the average company in the index.\\nSo we use that insight to search for exactly those companies that are benefiting from driving technological trends, and we aim to hold those companies for long enough that they will have a very positive impact on our clients’ portfolios. That takes me to the point of time horizon. What's the right period over which to judge what we're doing for our clients?\\nWe judge our own success over rolling five-year periods and we ask clients to do the same. That doesn't mean we ignore or are blind to the ups and downs along the way. But as long as those long-term trends that we're investing in are intact, as long as companies are doing well operationally, then we will be happy to continue owning those businesses in our clients’ portfolios in the confidence that will deliver good, long-term returns for our clients.\\n\\xa0\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds visit advisors.vanguard.com or call 800-997-2798 to obtain a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus.

What about a possible China/Taiwan conflict?\\n\\nAs a fundamental manager, how do you weigh market events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? \\nSo in terms of market events and geopolitical events, I think two things really matter in trying to weigh these up, what they mean. The first is to approach them with genuine humility. These events can often be very, very hard to predict ahead of time and to have genuine insight around. Take the Russian invasion of Ukraine, for example. Most Russian political experts claim that there was no real risk of invasion, and sadly, they were wrong.\\nThe way we deal with this [with] humility is by trying to build out multiple scenarios of what might happen to our portfolio and its companies. Not just what, but we think what one scenario we think is the most likely, and that I think is one way of protecting us against overconfidence, as some of these events and thinking through the implications. The other element is being resolutely long-term.\\nWhen these events happen, you get 24-hour news streams. You get news updates and insights or alleged insights, every hour coming through. And you have stock market prices that are incredibly volatile, creating pressures on the financial markets. And rather than sticking to a long-term time horizon, market horizons tend to contract during these periods. Time horizons become more like five days than five years.\\nSo I think we have a real advantage in being able to continue to think about these events through a five-year lens, not a five-day lens. And that becomes really important. What we’re trying to do when we revisit all scenarios in light of new information is [determine] how and to what extent does this really change the long-term structural trends we're investing in?\\nDoes it make the adoptions of electric vehicles materially less likely? Does it disrupt the adoption of online services, of online retail, of the semiconductor industry in the very long term? And moving onto the specifics of the examples like the Ukraine conflict; one thing that we think is an interesting second order effect is that actually we've been big believers in the energy transition. With the rising price of fossil fuels, the attractions of an electric vehicle from Tesla, or a wind turbine from Vestas, actually look higher.\\nWhat about a possible China/Taiwan conflict?\\nThe other [thing], when we get asked about a lot is the potential for conflict between China and Taiwan. There is obviously a risk there on a multi-decade view. I think the way we try to deal with that is, again, through scenario analysis. But it's also through making sure that if there are risks from certain geopolitical events, that we're compensated by the potential upside if those events don't occur, and we're not losing out on that upside.\\nTencent, over the last ten years has returned over ten times for our clients, and it's those sort of outlier returns that we're really seeking that more than compensate for any risks that are involved in that investing. And it's balancing those two that really matter over the long term.\\n\\xa0\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds visit advisors.vanguard.com or call 800-997-2798 to obtain a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus.

       "  'content': 'The advent of fourth-generation (4G) wireless mobile networks enabled a lot of value creation, but most was captured by adjacent technology and digital media companies rather than the wireless network operators themselves.\\nAs fifth-generation (5G) networks roll out in the U.S. this year, we are likely to see a continuation of those trends.\\nAs fixed income investors, we are cautious about technology and digital media companies. Although they may well continue to capture most of the value from 5G, their debt already tends to be high-quality and is trading at high valuations. We see more value in wireless telecoms and cell tower operators; their credit profiles should improve as carriers expand 5G coverage and monetize this service.\\n\\nLessons learned from 4G\\nIt has been 11 years since Verizon rolled out the world\\'s first large-scale 4G wireless network.\\n4G networks brought about a tremendous amount of change. Social media and video consumption migrated to mobile, and gig economy platforms emerged, all with tremendous social, political, and investment implications.\\n4G networks enabled value creation, but, as the chart illustrates, wireless carriers and infrastructure manufacturers captured comparatively little of that value. Other parts of the wireless value chain, including semiconductors, handsets, and especially mobile content, received the lion\\'s share.\\nStock market increases in the 4G era for parts of the wireless value chain\\nNote: Data are year-end figures from 2010 through 2021.\\nSources: S&P Capital IQ and Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nEmerging themes in U.S. 5G\\nAs 5G lights up across the U.S., we have been weighing whether this generation of wireless networks will be as significant as the former and what the investment implications could be.\\nHere are some of the themes we see materializing:\\n\\n5G has kicked off a generational investment cycle in fiber, cell towers, network infrastructure, and data center capacity.\\nHigher speeds will create new market opportunities for mobile content, such as cloud gaming, augmented reality, and embedded artificial intelligence.\\nThis will grow new markets for hardware (such as wearables), drive higher semiconductor content in devices, and spur large investments in semiconductor manufacturing capacity, especially in the west.\\n5G fixed wireless broadband will drive more competition and consumer choice in residential broadband markets.\\n\\nAs in the last cycle, wireless carriers likely won\\'t capture much of the value from 5G networks.\\nWireless markets were competitive during the 4G era, and we expect them to become increasingly so because of the blurring of distinctions between wireless and cable providers. Wireless will increasingly compete with cable for home broadband service, especially in underserved areas.\\n5G makes it more feasible for governments to pursue rural broadband goals through subsidies. These subsidies will boost growth opportunities for wireless but may come at the expense of greater regulatory oversight and lower long-term margins.\\nCautious on tech and digital media\\nTechnology and digital content will continue to capture most of the value from 5G. However, we don\\'t think this implies opportunities for credit investors, for a number of reasons. These high-quality sectors already trade at elevated valuations, leading to an asymmetric risk-return profile (that is, limited upside and comparatively greater downside risk).\\nTech companies may use their fortress balance sheets to pursue new market opportunities through mergers and acquisitions (M&A), to the detriment of creditors. The recently announced Oracle-Cerner transaction is a good example.\\n5G is contributing to high demand for semiconductors today, but we are concerned that the massive supply response will overshoot demand and lead to an inventory-led correction.\\nToday\\'s dominant technology companies won\\'t necessarily be the winners in 5G applications. Asian markets have a head start and will be more competitive during this cycle.\\nRegulatory scrutiny is elevated. In the 5G era, tech incumbents will have less latitude to buy rising threats (such as Facebook/Instagram and Alphabet/YouTube).\\nIf regulatory curbs, global competition, and excess capacity slow growth, firms may resort to using their balance sheets to drive earnings-per-share growth, which would entail moving down in credit quality.\\nBullish on wireless networks and cell tower operators\\nWe see better fixed income value in wireless telecoms, such as Verizon and T-Mobile US, and towers, including Crown Castle and American Tower. Driven by M&A, the U.S. wireless sector dropped in credit quality during the 4G era. \"In the U.S., wireless telecoms migrated from single-A to triple-B credit ratings,\" said Scott Miles, senior credit analyst. \"That wasn\\'t a great outcome for fixed income investors, but, as a result, they offer more value today.\" Additionally, North American wireless networks have invested heavily recently in capital equipment and wireless spectrum. Balance sheets are stretched, but we expect credit profiles to improve as carriers expand 5G coverage and monetize this service. Carriers should use the current inflationary environment to push up pricing while touting increased network capability.\\nWireless earnings growth should shift from low single digits today to mid-single digits or better, accelerating the recovery of credit profiles.\\nAlthough the mobile market is saturated, we see major growth opportunities opening for fixed wireless. The drivers will be population growth, pricing, and fixed wireless expansion.\\nRegulatory oversight will increase as wireless networks displace landlines in some underserved areas, limiting margin growth but also suppressing volatility.\\nIn Europe, expect a slow 5G rollout, greater competition, and limited revenue growth\\nThe themes we see emerging with 5G in Europe are similar to those in the U.S., with some noteworthy differences and nuances:\\nThe European telecom market is more fragmented, with many more operators than in the U.S., where three large, nationwide players dominate. This leads to an intensely competitive market environment, which in turn means revenue growth is likely to be anemic, with limited near-term catalysts for improvement.\\nThe pandemic has highlighted the need for governments, companies, and consumers to have robust broadband connectivity. This is a political priority, and the European Commission has laid out ambitious targets for 5G rollout. These include ensuring uninterrupted 5G coverage in urban areas and along main transport routes by 2025. In March 2021, the commission extended the objective to include universal 5G coverage in all populated areas by 2030.\\nThe rollout of fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) has been very fragmented in Europe, and countries including the U.K. and Germany need to make significant investments to catch up. Investment spend is likely to focus on FTTH in the near term before gradually shifting to 5G. After a period of significant acquisition activity, telecoms are facing a balancing act to keep leverage in check while investing in network expansion. Consequently, we expect Europe to roll out 5G more slowly than the U.S. and developed Asia.\\n\"The credit profiles in the European telecom sector should hold fairly steady, with network investment remaining elevated in the short-to-medium term and revenue and earnings growth likely to be modest,\" said Andreas Nagstrup, a European credit analyst based in London. \"There are, however, differences among telecom credits even in this somewhat challenging environment, which gives active managers scope to add value.\"\\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, emerging trends look set to support both the equity and credit markets\\nUnlike the U.S. and Europe, where there is a degree of homogeneity, Asia-Pacific is a highly diverse region, and the pace of 5G rollout varies markedly amid different market structures and regulatory environments. South Korea was first to roll out 5G in April 2019, followed closely by Australia, China, and Japan, whereas India aims to begin in 2022.\\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, as in the U.S., the 4G rollout resulted in significant shareholder value creation that was captured primarily by the U.S.-domiciled FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) and their Asian equivalents, the BATs (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent). “Asia-Pacific carriers also experienced a decline in credit quality as balance sheets became stretched, with significant increases in leverage to fund 4G investments in a highly competitive environment, limiting revenue growth,\" said Alicia Low, head of credit research for the region, based in Australia. \"The proverbial $64,000 question is, will 5G be different for Asia-Pacific wireless network operators?\"\\nPast experiences reduce risk of race to the bottom this time\\nWhile 4G and prior rollouts degenerated into a race to the bottom in terms of prices, 5G incumbents appear to have learned from past experiences, with more rational competition and carriers preferring to differentiate based on network quality and speed rather than exclusively on price.\\nInflation accelerating back to a pre-COVID pace from currently sluggish levels in Asia should provide carriers with cover to lift pricing, but its double-edged sword could also lead to higher-than-expected 5G rollout costs.\\nWe observe greater capital discipline, particularly in developed markets such as South Korea and Australia, in linking 5G investment to demand growth. Following in the footsteps of U.S. counterparts, Asia-Pacific carriers have or are in the process of recycling capital through divestment of infrastructure assets such as cell towers, with proceeds redeployed into 5G, capital management, and debt reduction—all supportive of credit fundamentals.\\nAs in the European Union, the post-pandemic regulatory environment in the Asia-Pacific region is likely to be more benign, with telecoms seen as national champions and enablers for digitization to support economies recovering from COVID. The regulatory pendulum is swinging against FAANGS and BATs because of their market dominance.\\n\"Although it\\'s fraught with danger to declare \\'this time is different,\\'\" said Low, \"four emerging trends—demand-driven capital expenditures, pricing discipline, capital recycling, and more benign regulatory environments—are supportive for both equity and credit markets in Asia-Pacific telecoms not seen in prior rollouts.\"\\nOpportunities for active fixed income managers in global telecoms\\n\"We expect credit profiles in this sector to be broadly stable to slightly improving,\" said Miles. \"There are, however, differences among telecom credits, and we will deploy our global research capabilities to identify which companies in each region may have better prospects for improving their credit profiles and select securities that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns.\"\\nBy investing in a Vanguard active global credit fund, you get access to this expertise and can benefit from attractive investment opportunities globally.Active fixed income at Vanguard\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$335B\\nTaxable bond AUM 14 funds*/1 ETF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$230B\\nMunicipal bond AUM 5 national funds/7 state-specific funds\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30+\\nPortfolio managers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30+\\nTraders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n60+\\nResearch analysts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n140+\\nDedicated team members\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*Includes funds advised by Wellington Management Company LLP.Note: As of December 31, 2021.\\n\\xa0\\nView our active fixed income funds\\n\\xa0Notes:\\n\\nVanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars.

       "  'content': \"Your clients have most likely funded their traditional IRAs for years, if not decades. And they have probably built up a substantial balance in those tax-deferred holdings. But as you know, financial situations, tax brackets, and tax laws change over the years. Your clients' required minimum distributions (RMDs) are not only taxable, they could be quite large and push your clients into higher tax brackets. One way to potentially reduce your clients' tax burden in retirement is to consider converting their traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.\\nAs your clients approach retirement, exploring the tax advantages of a Roth IRA is the perfect opportunity to have a conversation, especially if clients expect their future tax rate to be higher than their current one.\\nHere's how it works: Client assets are transferred from a traditional IRA to a Roth reasonably quickly, but the typical holdup is the tax bill due at the time of conversion. Since traditional IRA assets have been tax-deferred, taxes are due at the time of conversion, and a large tax bill isn't something many clients will be eager to pay. However, these concerns may be overblown in many instances when clients consider their break-even tax rate (BETR).\\nExplore the benefits of a Roth conversion\\nRoth IRAs have several advantages over their traditional counterpart:1\\n\\nNo required minimum distribution—You can guide clients on when and how to withdraw funds.\\nTax-free growth—All investments in the account grow free from taxation.\\nTax-free withdrawals— After age 59½, clients can tap the account without fear of tax or penalty. Basis can also be withdrawn at any time.\\nSocial Security and Medicare flexibility—Doing a Roth IRA conversion before claiming Social Security and Medicare is beneficial, because future distributions from Roth won't impact the tax implications of Social Security and Medicare surcharges.\\nVariety of accounts—Having multiple buckets to withdraw from provides additional tax planning benefits.\\n\\nMany of your clients may understandably still underestimate the perks that a Roth conversion can provide since they must pay a significant tax bill upfront for the transfer. By taking the break-even tax rate (BETR) into account, clients can be shown how Roth conversions are more beneficial than conventional wisdom suggests.\\nUse the BETR calculation for more effective planning\\nThe conventional approach is relatively straightforward. Calculate a client’s future expected tax rate at the anticipated time of withdrawal and compare it with their current expected tax rate. If current rates are lower, the conversion makes sense. If current rates are higher, keep the assets in the traditional IRA.\\nThe BETR could be a more effective calculation than simply comparing future and current tax rates. \\xa0The BETR is the point at which after-tax withdrawal values are the same whether you convert or not and knowing this break-even point could show that a conversion is beneficial in more instances than relying on the conventional comparison between future and present tax rates alone.\\nUsing the BETR takes more data into the equation, such as:\\n\\nAbility to pay conversion taxes from an outside taxable investment account.\\nThe tax basis of the IRA account. A market pullback is often the best time to make a conversion since reduced capital gains means a lighter tax bill.\\nPotential future contributions to the IRA account, like backdoor Roth conversions.\\nClient time horizon (a longer time horizon reduces BETR and makes conversions even more attractive).\\n\\nWhen paying conversion taxes from funds in a taxable account, the BETR approach shows that conversion may be beneficial even if future tax rates are expected to be lower than current rates. Your clients will maximize the assets growing tax-free in the Roth IRA by using taxable funds to pay the conversion tax.\\nThe three scenarios shown in the figure below differ only in the account from which Roth conversion taxes are paid. Each assumes a 35% current marginal tax rate. In Scenario 1, conversion taxes are withheld and paid from the IRA (we assume that no tax penalties are incurred for early withdrawal). In Scenarios 2 and 3, these taxes are not withheld during conversion. Instead, they are paid separately, from either a tax-efficient portfolio in a taxable account (Scenario 2) or a tax-inefficient portfolio in a taxable account (Scenario 3).\\nNotes: Our calculations assume a 6% annual return, a 35% ordinary income tax rate, an 18.8% dividend tax rate, an 18.8% long-term capital gains rate, a 2% dividend yield, 0% basis, and a 20-year investment horizon. For scenarios 2 and 3 our calculations also assume that no additional tax liability is incurred when liquidating assets in a taxable account to pay the conversion taxes. This hypothetical illustration does not represent the return on any particular investment and the rate of return is not guaranteed.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhile having some funds in traditional and Roth IRAs can be beneficial, help your clients understand a Roth conversion's benefits. A Roth IRA is a unique account that your clients can use to reach long-term goals beyond just funding retirement, such as estate planning. Having you as their advisor to discuss these strategies with will provide clients with peace of mind.\\nTo learn more about the BETR approach to Roth conversions, read our research paper below.\"},\n",

Data through April 30, 2022.\\n\\xa0In addition to the drawdowns in the stock and bond markets, there has been a significant spike in daily volatility. It is critical to understand that predicting volatility spikes or declines, and the daily direction of the market within volatility regimes has not worked. However, volatility itself does have persistence and, as such, near-term future volatility is influenced by recent trailing volatility. Meaning that when the markets are in a high volatility regime, the expectation for high volatility to persist in the near term is high, with the best and worst days tending to cluster around each other. Eventually, and without a signal, volatility has been known to normalize. This can be seen in the chart below.\\nThe best and worst trading days tend to happen together\\nS&P 500 Index daily price returns January 1, 2020, through May 13, 2022\\nSources: Vanguard calculations using data from FactSet.

A proactive conversation in which you convince a client to stay the course could justify many years of fees in terms of value added (see below). Look back to the most recent major market downturn from 2020. Even accounting for the current return environment, your clients would have been much better off (+8% versus –17%) by staying invested versus moving to cash, or a difference of approximately 25%, and are likely much more satisfied, loyal, and inclined to listen to you today as a result.\\nThe COVID-19 crisis tells the stay-the-course tale\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

       "  'content': 'Soaring inflation. Rising rates. Market volatility. Your clients are most likely calling you with every headline looking for your guidance on how to adjust, if at all, their portfolio strategies. As you know, the Federal Reserve has commenced an anticipated series of interest rate hikes to stem inflation, and the effects are starting to reverberate throughout financial markets.\\nSo what are the kinds of portfolio management strategies for responding not only to the rocky, recent past quarter, but also to the prospect of a rising-rates environment over the next cycle? The fixed income allocation of your clients\\' portfolios is a good place to start—picking up our previous analysis of the historically poor bond performance in the first quarter of 2022.\\nAre bonds getting too risky?\\nAfter digesting the results of the unpleasant first quarter of 2022, your clients and some of you might wonder if their current allocation to bonds is still appropriate.\\nIn conducting this evaluation, you and your clients would do well to keep a few things in mind—some obvious, some perhaps not immediately so:\\n\\nAs with most investments, bonds carry risk. But historically, they\\'ve had and continue to have lower downside capital risk than stocks. In fact, the magnitude of fixed income drawdowns has paled to that of stocks (See chart below, \"Stocks exhibit exponentially more drawdown risk than bonds\"). For clients who are more risk averse, this can be a crucial distinction.\\nAllocation attempts to address multiple types of risk. Here, you have an opportunity to reframe the conversation by educating clients on those other forms of risk. For example, stocks come with greater drawdown risk, but less purchasing power risk than do more conservative investments. With inflation front-and-center in the news cycle, it\\'s an opportune time to explain why holding periods, goals, objectives, and behaviors matter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStocks exhibit exponentially more drawdown risk than bonds\\nAnnual returns and max intra-year drawdown\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nNotes: U.S. bonds as represented by IA SBBI U.S. Intermediate-Term Government Bond Index from January 1, 1970, to December 31, 1972; Bloomberg U.S. Government/Credit Intermediate-Term Index from January 1, 1973, to December 31, 1975; Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index from January 1, 1976, to June 30, 2009; and Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Float Adjusted thereafter.

But it\\'s often a different thing entirely to communicate the benefits of deliberate, patient action to clients—especially as they watch their portfolio balances dwindle. Following are a few things you can do to help clients feel supported and that they are continuing progress toward their goals.\\nReframe the conversation\\n\\nTake an EQ+IQ approach—that is, reinforce the \"emotional intelligence\" of empathetic understanding with your informed perspective as a financial professional.\\nFocus on progress toward and continued ability to meet goals—remind them to view short-term returns in a big-picture perspective; and to keep track of \"the numbers they care about\" that represent long-term objectives.\\nConsider language using success rate percentages rather than market return percentages.\\n\\nEvaluate whether the client\\'s circumstances have changed\\n\\nGiven recent experiences, do you have insight into the client\\'s risk tolerance that might warrant a strategic change to their portfolio?\\nAre their goals still in reach?\\n\\nKnow that staying the course requires action\\n\\nRebalance the portfolio if allocations have drifted out of tolerance bands.\\nPerform tax-loss harvesting if appropriate.\\nUse the opportunity to perform portfolio cleanup (review asset location, concentrated positions, and high-cost legacy positions).\\nConsider Roth conversions where appropriate.\\nImplement a dynamic spending strategy for retirees.\\n\\nPortfolio response: Remember that higher current yields mean higher future nominal returns\\nThe Fed\\'s recent nudge upward of the federal funds rate has increased interest rates throughout the economy—including current yields on bonds. As yields go up, bond prices go down. For bondholders with a need to sell assets prior to maturity in the near term, this relationship is understandably disheartening. But as an investor\\'s time horizon (and potential ability to benefit from higher rates) lengthens, that can be good news.\\nFor you, that means a need to evaluate a fixed income client\\'s investment duration versus the duration of their portfolio\\'s fixed income holdings. (See chart, below, \"How might things look from here?\" for a hypothetical depiction of return outcomes across a range of potential interest rate changes).\\nHow might things look from here?\\nHypothetical impact of changes in interest rates, Q1 2022\\nThis hypothetical example does not represent the return on any particular investment.\\nNotes: \"No change\" yields are as of December 31, 2021, based on the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and \"End of Q1 2022\" hypotheticals are as of March 31, 2022. For simplicity, duration was assumed to remain at 6.8 years for year end 2021 and 6.58 years for end of Q1 2022; but in practice, as yields change, duration also changes. Such a dramatic change in yields as this example assumes would likely constitute a rather significant adjustment to a fund\\'s weighted average duration. For purposes of illustration, we assumed no change to yields in subsequent years.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nWhat changes might you consider for clients\\' fixed income portfolios?\\nA client\\'s situation might dictate a need to search for more productive sources of yield—for instance, if they have a shorter time horizon and more immediate income is a concern. There are various rates and yield curve calls an advisor might consider, but they come with caveats.\\nRates and yield curve calls\\n\\nShorten duration and increase credit exposure—but acknowledge this can lead to a more equity-like portfolio in terms of drawdown risk.\\nTrade duration—but know that this has not historically been a reliable source of alpha.\\nChoose to avoid bonds altogether, and instead barbell with cash and equities. But one must factor the considerable likelihood of being wrong on interest rates and improperly timing re-entry into bonds. Predicting rates, historically, has been an activity fraught with off-target forecasts (see the chart, below, \"Making the right call on rates has proven difficult\").\\n\\nMaking the right call on rates has proven difficult\\nU.S. federal funds effective rate and forward rates\\nNotes: Monthly data are from January 31, 2008, to February 28, 2022. The federal funds effective rate is annualized. Forward rates are based on futures contracts with tenor up to 2 years.\\nSource: Bloomberg.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSimilarly, you have a number of credit selection and sector rotation options at your disposal—and those options come with important caveats and questions to be answered. All those decisions amount to a lot to manage on top of running a practice, maintaining client relationships, and prospecting; engaging an outside, dedicated active fixed income manager could therefore be advantageous.\\nCredit selection and sector rotation\\n\\nAs an advisor, you need to determine what benchmark to use on the client performance report. If you change the duration, are you also changing the benchmark? If so, how are you explaining the change to your client? If not, are you okay taking the practice risk of incurring tracking error and potentially underperforming? Do you have the same capabilities (not to mention time) as dedicated active asset managers?\\nGiven all of the risks of managing duration on your own, hiring a world-class active manager such as Vanguard for your fixed income exposures can better capture in real time the potential advantages of outperformance, as opposed to you trying to time the bond markets.\\nLow-cost active bond funds don\\'t force the active manager to take on risk to overcome large \"fee hurdles,\" and therefore the breakeven for active success is achievable.\\n\\nKeep your clients focused on their long term plans\\nAfter a distressing Q1 for their bond portfolios, clients may need reassurance that their plans still work for them. You can show them that in the big picture, three-year returns were, in fact, near the median. As you\\'re encouraging this longer-term outlook, dip into the reservoir of trust you\\'ve developed to serve as your clients\\' behavioral coach—this is where you deliver your ultimate value.\\nAlso consider these key action items and perspectives:\\n\\nUse the opportunity to clean up the portfolio and focus on tax efficiency.\\nKeep in mind that while higher current yields mean lower current asset prices, they also mean higher future nominal returns.\\nFigure out how much you want to change the portfolio, if at all. If changes are in order, then it may be worth drawing upon the depth of expertise that a talented team of low-cost, active fixed income professionals at Vanguard can offer. Leveraging a team of specialists and their insights could provide more advantages than trying to time the bond market on your own—with the added benefits of saving you time and lowering risk to your practice.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nSpecial thanks to Ted Dinucci for contributing to this article.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'With inflation at a 40-year high and the labor market still tight, the Federal Reserve has pulled another instrument from its monetary policy toolbox. In addition to raising its key interest rate target by half a percentage point on May 4, the Fed has said it will start to shrink its balance sheet, another step in post-pandemic policy normalization.\\nExpanding the balance sheet by buying government bonds on the open market, known as quantitative easing, is an unconventional tool that the Fed and other central banks use to stimulate economies when policy interest rates are near or below zero and can\\'t effectively be lowered further. Now, with rates rising, there\\'s logic in the balance sheet\\'s expansion being reversed.\\n\"The Fed has minimal experience in removing stimulus by shrinking its balance sheet,\" said Josh Hirt, a Vanguard senior economist who studies the Fed, \"so markets unsurprisingly take notice. That\\'s especially true now as the Fed plans to move with a less cautious cadence compared with the previous time it employed quantitative tightening.\"\\nWhat\\'s behind the faster pace of quantitative tightening?\\nThe Fed plans to reduce its $8.5 trillion balance sheet beginning June 1, when it will no longer reinvest proceeds of up to $30 billion in maturing Treasury securities and up to $17.5 billion in maturing agency mortgage-backed securities per month. Beginning September 1, those caps will rise to $60 billion and $35 billion, respectively, for a maximum potential monthly balance sheet roll-off of $95 billion.\\nThe Fed ended bond purchases only in March 2022, so this tightening is occurring considerably sooner than in the last reduction cycle. After the global financial crisis, the Fed ended quantitative easing purchases in 2014 but didn\\'t start to reduce its balance sheet until 2017. The maximum roll-off then was roughly half of that expected this time around.\\nThree key factors explain today\\'s faster pace:\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s balance sheet is significantly larger this time relative to what would be considered an optimal range to effectively implement monetary policy.\\nThe economy is at a more advanced stage of the business cycle and running hotter, as reflected in a smaller output gap, lower unemployment, and higher inflation than in 2014.\\nThe Fed is likely less uncertain now about how markets and financial conditions may react given that it has at least some experience in communicating and executing roll-off plans.\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s balance sheet roll-off: Different circumstances, different plan\\nNotes: Inflation gap is defined as the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index relative to the Federal Reserve\\'s 2% inflation target. Employment gap is defined as the unemployment rate relative to NAIRU, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, the Fed\\'s estimate of long-run unemployment. Output gap is defined as real GDP relative to the Congressional Budget Office\\'s assessment of real potential GDP. Estimate for the balance sheet roll-off path assumes that monthly proceeds of $30 billion in Treasury securities and $17.5 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) won\\'t be reinvested in the three months beginning June 1, 2022. Beginning September 1, 2022, monthly Treasury and MBS roll-off caps will rise to $60 billion and $35 billion, respectively. For MBS, roll-off after September 1, 2022, assumes forecasted MBS prepayments per the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\\'s \"Federal Reserve Asset Purchases: The Pandemic Response and Considerations Ahead,\" March 2, 2022. Consistent with \"Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve\\'s Balance Sheet,\" May 4, 2022, the estimated roll-off pace slows and then stops when the balance sheet is within range of optimal to allow assets to grow into the optimal range. The optimal balance sheet estimate comprises a constant $1.5 trillion level of required reserves, currency in circulation grown by 4% nominal GDP, and a constant 2.8% of GDP allocation for Treasury general account and other liabilities as per Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\\'s March 8, 2019, speech \"Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead.\"\\nSources: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Refinitiv, and Vanguard.\\n\\nWhy interest rates will remain the Fed\\'s primary tool\\nWhat likely won\\'t change is the Fed favoring the policy rate as its primary tool to effect policy, with balance sheet reduction running in the proverbial background to maximize predictability and minimize market disruption. That, along with concerns that balance sheet reduction would lead to much higher interest rates at the long end of the yield curve, is why the Fed set monthly caps for letting bonds mature passively rather than planning to actively sell securities from its portfolio.\\nAnother consideration relates to the eventual terminal size of the balance sheet in terms of ensuring adequate market liquidity and carrying out monetary policy, which would serve as a guide for when the Fed would end asset roll-off. At present, this terminal size is uncertain. However, as shown in the graphic using simplifying assumptions, Vanguard estimates that the balance sheet may settle around 18% of GDP, or just above $5 trillion, before the Fed begins winding down and eventually ending its roll-off, at which point it will allow its assets to grow in relation to the size of the economy. \"That level could be reached around the end of 2025, barring any pauses or significant deviations from the currently communicated plan,\" Hirt said.\\nA challenging environment for central banks ahead\\nThe Fed\\'s tightening plan comes with challenges, according to Brian Quigley, Vanguard head of MBS, agencies, and volatility. \"Judging the appropriate pace and cumulative amount of tightening will be more difficult,\" Quigley said. \"The Fed stepping away as a buyer of the market will prompt a period of adjustment that will ripple across financial markets as valuations will have to cheapen to attract more price-sensitive buyers. That this will be happening as a number of other major central banks will be hiking rates and unwinding their balance sheets is a complicating factor.\"\\nHow effectively policymakers remove accommodations from global economies will remain a crucial theme for 2022 and beyond. In the near term, Vanguard economists continue to expect that economic growth and the labor market will moderate but remain strong toward year-end. Core measures of inflation (removing volatile food and energy prices) are similarly expected to moderate throughout the year but to stay at levels well above the Fed\\'s 2% target.\\nAmid a challenging environment for central banks to balance inflation dynamics, the pace and eventual end point of policy rate increases will likely remain a focal point beyond 2022.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Helping your clients weather market cycles and enjoy better risk-adjusted results takes a planned approach. It includes a thorough evaluation of how the timing and execution of rebalancing may affect their portfolios and generate tax consequences.\\nPart of a solid rebalancing plan is to decide whether to rebalance on a periodic basis, or as the result of passing certain thresholds in drift, keeping in mind some tax-efficient methods to rebalance.\\nHere are six tactics for rebalancing a portfolio in a more tax-efficient way:1. Start with tax-advantaged accounts\\nOne place to begin is rebalancing your clients' tax-advantaged accounts. The benefit of this approach is that any rebalancing trades are tax-exempt at the time they are made. This avoids immediate tax consequences that may be beneficial in periods of high income.\\nYou will find this opportunity easiest to implement if your clients have a mix of asset classes in their accounts. Roth accounts can be particularly advantageous since portions of the Roth can be distributed tax-exempt at any time (up to principal) and enjoy tax-advantaged distribution rules.\\n2. Re-direct cash flows in taxable accounts\\nWith taxable accounts, one way to rebalance is by directing new purchases and reinvested distributions into underweighted asset classes. For example, when a portfolio with a target allocation of 50% stocks and 50% bonds has drifted beyond the plan's target allocation threshold, it might make sense to add new contributions or reinvest dividends to the underweighted side until the portfolio is back at the target allocation. Conversely, when taking a withdrawal, it might make sense to draw down from an overweight asset class.\\nFor your clients taking the required minimum distribution from their retirement account(s), but who don't need the distribution for daily living expenses, those assets can also be reinvested to increase the allocations to an underweighted asset class in nonretirement accounts.\\n3. Consider cost basis\\nWhen rebalancing, look for opportunities to harvest losses or manage cost basis across holdings in your clients' portfolios. Understanding their current and future expected income can help evaluate which shares to sell or which accounting method is most advantageous. In comparatively low-income years, you may want to sell lower-basis shares. In comparatively high-income years, it might make sense to sell higher-basis shares. If income is relatively stable year over year, an average accounting method may be the right answer. An average accounting method is easy to use but could limit some tax-planning strategies because clients are locked into this method for all shares they own until a new method is chosen. If a household's income generally has peaks and valleys, watching cost basis may help control taxes in the long run.\\n4. Explore charitable giving and annual gifting\\nYou may want to consider rebalancing opportunities when your clients are deciding how and what to gift. It might make sense to gift shares of overweighted holdings with a low-cost basis in a taxable account directly to the desired charity or beneficiary. For example, when gifting to a beneficiary in a lower marginal tax bracket, consider evaluating options to gift shares in-kind rather than to gift cash. This strategy might also make sense when gifting to a charity. Additionally, charitably inclined clients may focus their rebalancing in an IRAs and use the proceeds to fund a qualified charitable distributions (QCDs).\\n5. Keep in mind the timing of fund distributions when rebalancing near year-end\\nIt's all about timing. When rebalancing, it might make sense to sell before a distribution to avoid the taxes on that distribution. Conversely, buying right before a distribution may have its own tax and income implications.\\n6. Use rebalancing to improve the tax efficiency of the portfolio\\nMany portfolios were originally built based on priorities other than tax efficiency. Take advantage of rebalancing opportunities to shift the portfolio into more tax-efficient options, such as exchange-traded funds, passive investments, or other low-turnover options.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you found this content interesting and want to read more, check out our recommendations below.\"},\n",

Nominal municipal bonds featured a yield to maturity of 2.79% as of July 31.1 That presented attractive valuations both relative to other bond sectors and from a historical perspective. In the past ten years, muni yields have only been higher 13% of the time within daily observations. With a AAA Muni yield/Treasury ratio of 97% at 30 years, tax-exempt debt is particularly attractive in the long end of the yield curve.\\nDepending on an investor's state and federal income tax brackets and the particular investment, the investor's tax-equivalent municipal yield may be higher than 5%. For investors in higher-tax states like California and New York, taxable-equivalent yields of corresponding state indexes may be nearly 5.75% for CA, or higher for NY.\\nMunicipal tax-equivalent yields are relatively attractive\\n(as of July 31, 2022)\\nSource: Bloomberg indexes, using yield-to-worst data as of July 31, 2022.

The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nDespite the negative returns it took to get here, higher municipal yields potentially can provide higher levels of tax-exempt income for years to come.\\nHow the market turned\\nThe municipal market, despite its idiosyncratic nature, is much influenced by U.S. Treasury yields. When Federal Reserve officials signaled their commitment to fighting inflation early this year, investors began pricing in some 11 to 13 quarter-point expected interest rate hikes through 2022, which upended the fixed income markets. Municipals were no exception.\\nA fundamentally solid market\\nTypically, a significant risk-off event is required to reach current yield levels, such as an economic recession. Such conditions threaten downgrades or even defaults. But in today's environment, municipal credit has been bolstered by federal fiscal stimulus provided directly both to municipalities as well as to end consumers.\\nState and local income tax revenues have risen at a velocity not seen in 20 years, easing near-term credit concerns. Issuers have used some of the flood of finances to build up their rainy-day funds, which can be a cushion for meeting budgets even during recessionary or otherwise difficult conditions. All of which means that credit conditions are better than they have been in years. Such measures will likely safeguard municipal bond valuations relative to other credit sectors (like U.S. corporates) in the event of a downturn.\\nStates' rainy-day funds as a percentage of general fund expenditures\\n(50-state median, for fiscal years indicated)\\nSources: Pew Charitable Trusts, using data from the National Association of State Budget Officers as of December 31, 2021.\\n\\n\\nNational totals for state and local income taxes\\n(in billions)\\nSource: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, as of June 30, 2022.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nCost averaging in reentry\\nThese arguments for an attractive yield in a healthy market are not meant as a timing signal, since there are risks with all investments.\\nIt is possible that the market will continue to price in more interest rate hikes and that outflows could continue. Either of these potential events could lead to further price drops (and yield increases) in the near future.\\nHowever, the bond market has already factored in an aggressive Fed rate-hiking campaign. While there is substantial uncertainty around Fed policy in 2023, longer term yields seem to be settling close to the Federal Reserve's long-run neutral rate of 2.5%. If markets calm around these levels, it could create a technical tailwind for municipal bond pricing as cash that left tax-exempt funds earlier in 2022 may return.\\nInvestors considering a new allocation to the muni sector, or those hoping for reentry after fleeing earlier this year, might consider a cost-averaging strategy. This would help diversify the risk of coming in too early or too late.\\nA better buffer\\nWith yields as high as they are, municipal bond funds offer a buffer against yields rising even further. A muni bond fund with a yield of 2.79% and a duration of 6 years, would still provide a positive return for the next 12 months even if yields were to rise another 40 basis points across the curve.\\nDuration is the weighted average time for an investor to receive coupon interest and principal payments that would potentially allow the investor to recoup the bond's price from its cash flows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVanguard municipal bond funds\\n\\n\\nAdmiral™ or ETF Shares\\n\\n\\nExpense ratio2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNational\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTax-Exempt Bond ETF\\n\\n\\nVTEB\\n\\n\\n0.05%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVWSUX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLimited-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVMLUX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntermediate-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVWIUX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVWLUX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh-Yield Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVWALX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nState\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalifornia Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVCADX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalifornia Long-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVCLAX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMassachusetts Tax-Exempt3\\n\\n\\nVMATX\\n\\n\\n0.13%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew Jersey Long-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVNJUX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew York Long-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVNYUX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOhio Long-Term Tax-Exempt3\\n\\n\\nVOHIX\\n\\n\\n0.13%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPennsylvania Long-Term Tax-Exempt\\n\\n\\nVPALX\\n\\n\\n0.09%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n1 Figures as indicated by the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index.\\n2 As reported in each fund’s most recent prospectus.

       "  'content': \"Central banks have an unenviable challenge in the months ahead: trying to gain control of inflation without choking off economic growth. To succeed, they’ll need to raise interest rates to just the right level. Overshoot with too-restrictive policy, and they risk inviting recession. Undershoot, and they put their hard-earned credibility at risk by letting inflation fester.Three factors will determine whether central banks can navigate a soft landing of continued growth with prices rising at acceptable levels, or whether they miss an uncomfortably short runway:• The pace of rate hikes required for central banks to assert their inflation-fighting credibility.• How much wage and inflation expectations rise in defiance of that credibility.• The incidence of additional unanticipated shocks to supply or demand.Whether central banks succeed in delivering a soft landing will depend in part on how high they raise rates above the neutral rate, and how long they keep them there. (The neutral rate is the level at which policy interest rates would neither stimulate nor restrict an economy.)\\nMarket policy rate expectations reflect a tale of two regions\\nNotes: Market expectations for central bank policy rates at a given time are represented by one-month forward swap rates. U.S. swaps are based on published overnight federal funds rate indexes. Euro area swaps are based on the published euro overnight index average. Neutral rate ranges are Vanguard estimates. Estimates of the neutral rate are determined by long-term economic factors and are subject to a wide band of statistical uncertainty. Estimates of the nominal neutral rate assume inflation of 2% in the U.S. and 1.8% in the euro area.Sources: Vanguard analysis using data from Bloomberg, as of April 27, 2022.\\n\\nMarket expectations of the terminal interest rate—the highest point in a rate-hiking cycle—have increased significantly since March. However, central bank challenges vary by region, and differences are readily apparent when comparing the United States with the euro area.\\nIn the U.S., where headline inflation has soared to 8.5%, markets are pricing in a terminal rate of 3.5% by mid-2023. This likely reflects the expectation that the Fed will be aggressive in fighting inflation amid a tight labor market.The chart also highlights the Fed’s exposure to potential policy error. Policy rates above neutral will be effective in fighting inflation precisely because they restrict economic activity—which increases the risk of recession. (An initial estimate of first-quarter U.S. GDP showed an unexpected economic contraction. This exemplifies the challenging signals that the Fed may encounter in the months ahead.)\\nInflation dynamics support lower euro area policy rates\\nNotes: Core inflation excludes volatile food and energy prices and is considered a better indicator of persistent inflation.Sources: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Eurostat, and Bloomberg, as of April 27, 2022.\\n\\nMarkets in the euro area, meanwhile, anticipate that the European Central Bank (ECB) will raise interest rates more slowly toward the neutral rate.\\nEuro area headline inflation rose to 7.4% in March. More than half the latest surge was attributable to energy prices, a component less likely to translate into higher persistent inflation. Inflation in the U.S. has been more broad-based—and thus more likely to persist—with only around a quarter recently attributable to energy prices. Moreover, the pace at which wage and inflation expectations could rise in defiance of central bank credibility appears higher in the U.S. compared with the euro area.\\nUnanticipated shocks matter to policy rates, too \\nThe path of interest rates over the next 12 months is not predetermined. It will depend on forthcoming data and unanticipated shocks. A further round of disruptions to supply—owing, for instance, to the spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in China or restrictions on the flow of natural gas between Russia and Europe—would likely stoke global inflation.\\nUncertainty surrounding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a more immediate concern than inflation in the euro area, given the region’s proximity to the conflict. Consumer confidence is down. Any hints of weakness in forthcoming GDP readings will likely become part of the ECB’s rate-setting calculus.\\nCentral bank credibility benefits businesses and households\\nInflation has reached levels that many parts of the developed world haven’t seen for 30 to 40 years. That makes the current bout of fast-rising prices a crucial test for central banks, some of which started targeting inflation in the early 1990s.\\nWe believe that a soft landing in the U.S. is possible, but more than that, we believe the Fed will do whatever it takes to bring inflation under control. When all is said and done, inflation back at central banks’ 2% targets will benefit businesses and households alike. Low and stable inflation engenders the confidence that economies need to thrive.\\n\\xa0\\nSub-asset class performance in a rising real rate environment\\nLearn what sub-asset classes historically have outperformed during rising real rate environments.\\nView insightsFragile–handle with care\\nBond returns plunged near record lows to begin 2022.

       "  'content': 'Consumers expect most things to be customized these days, from sneakers to car insurance. You may have noticed that investors are increasingly adopting direct indexing strategies to personalize their investing experiences as well.1 The topic may be generating buzz, but what exactly is direct indexing and how does it work? Which of your clients could potentially benefit from the strategy?\\nFirst, let\\'s clarify the name. Financial services providers are using several terms in addition to direct indexing to describe this technology, including personalized indexing and custom indexing. We use the term personalized—and named our product Vanguard Personalized Indexing—because we feel it\\'s the most accurate: Our intuitive software allows advisors to personalize each portfolio to suit their clients\\' preferences, values, and tax situations.\\nHow does personalized indexing work?\\nPicture the way familiar investments like mutual funds or ETFs are constructed. Investors own shares of a basket of securities that seeks to track a given benchmark, such as the S&P 500 or the Russell 3000. By contrast, personalized indexing investors directly own individual stocks in a separately managed account (SMA) that represents a chosen market-capitalization-weighted benchmark. Typically, it\\'s not necessary to own every stock in an index in order approximate its performance.\\nBecause investors have direct ownership of the individual securities in their portfolios, they gain unique opportunities for tax efficiency and personalization that may not be possible with ETFs and mutual funds:\\n\\nImproved tax efficiency. Personalized indexing provides increased opportunities for tax-loss harvesting (TLH) of individual securities, which can help you capture additional tax alpha for your clients. The technology also allows you to guide clients through tax-effective transitions to personalized indexing.\\nExpressing ESG preferences and factor tilts. You can help clients express environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or socially responsible investing (SRI) preferences. You can tilt their portfolios toward stocks with certain characteristics like momentum or value, known as factors.\\nTransparency. Because you know exactly what\\'s in the portfolio, you can construct completion portfolios around concentrated positions at the individual security level, while minimizing the tax impact.\\n\\nSource: Vanguard\\n\\nIs personalized indexing a new strategy?\\nUltra-high-net-worth investors have been using SMAs for years. In the past, investors had to be able to afford to buy the stocks needed to approximate a given index\\'s performance. Rebalancing the portfolio so it continued to correspond to the index was also difficult and time-consuming for investors and their advisors.\\nSeveral relatively recent developments have made personalized indexing accessible to a wider range of investors. Software innovations have automated processes such as regular scanning for TLH opportunities and rebalancing. Most brokerage firms now offer commission-free trades, dramatically reducing transaction costs. Additionally, investors now have the ability to buy fractional shares of stocks, making it more affordable to fund an SMA that models an index.\\nWhy is TLH so important in personalized indexing?\\nYou likely already use year-end TLH to help improve your clients’ after-tax returns. Personalized indexing opens up many more opportunities for TLH that can help you capture additional tax alpha for them.\\nUnlike bundled products such as mutual funds or ETFs, personalized indexing allows investors to harvest losses at the security level. Here\\'s how it works: Stocks that drop below their cost basis are sold, and correlated (but not \"substantially identical\") replacement stocks are immediately repurchased to navigate the wash-sale rule.2 Because personalized indexing investors have direct ownership of the individual stocks in their portfolios, losses can be captured even in a year when the index gains in value.\\nFor example, the value of the S&P 500 increased 9.76% in the fourth quarter of 2021, yet there were still 133 individual companies that lost value during that time.3 Harvested losses can be used to offset capital gains and then up to $3,000 of ordinary taxable income (as of the 2021 tax year). Losses can also be carried forward to future years.\\nThe frequency that a personalized indexing portfolio is scanned for TLH opportunities—quarterly, monthly, or even daily (as with Vanguard Personalized Indexing)—is key to maximizing investors\\' tax alpha. Our sophisticated algorithms automatically review each account daily and harvest individual security losses as opportunities arise. Personalized indexing with daily TLH has boosted some investors\\' after-tax returns by 1%–2% or more.4 For high-net-worth investors, TLH in a personalized index can continue to deliver tax alpha even if the market experiences sustained low volatility.\\nMarginal contribution to maximal TLH alpha*\\n*Assumes quarterly contributions\\nSource: Kevin Khang, Alan Cummings, Thomas Paradise, and Brennan O’Connor, 2022. Personalized indexing: A portfolio construction plan. Valley Forge, Pa.: The Vanguard Group. Simulation as of September 2021.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOne problem that can arise with systematically harvesting tax losses is that eventually you will have sold all the losing stocks in the portfolio. Because of the potential capital gains that would result from selling those low-cost-basis stocks, switching to another investing strategy could be costly.\\nFor this reason, personalized indexing with TLH is more effective when there is regular cash flow (to purchase new securities) and when used as a strategy for high-net-worth investors in higher tax brackets, who may have realized gains from other types of investments, such as real estate, private equity, or hedge funds. Other investors may decide not to sell the stocks in their personalized indexes at all but, rather, plan to leave them to charity, since nonprofits don\\'t owe federal income tax on gifts.\\nWhat if my clients want to customize their portfolios?\\nInvestors increasingly say that expressing ESG or SRI preferences in their investment portfolios is important to them.⁵ Whether they want to support companies with a low-carbon footprint or base their choices on United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, personalized indexing makes it simple for you to align clients’ investments with their values. You can:\\n\\nApply screens to exclude companies that produce tobacco, for example, or have been flagged for human rights abuses.\\nApply tilts to add a preferential weight to the portfolio to maximize certain positive attributes, such as gender diversity or sustainable development.\\nExclude specific companies from the portfolio, either for personal reasons or because of a large, existing holding of a stock. For example, an Apple executive whose portfolio is heavily concentrated in tech stocks could build a personalized index around that concentration.\\n\\nAdditionally, you or your client may have a conviction in certain risk factors such as value, momentum, or volatility. Personalized indexing can help you manage those factors in addition to any ESG/SRI screens or tilts.\\nWhen is personalized indexing right for my clients?\\nFor the right clients, personalized indexing is a powerful tool that can help you solve complex financial problems. However, it\\'s not a good fit for every investor. Let\\'s look at some situations where clients might benefit from this strategy:\\n\\nCapturing tax alpha. Clients in a higher federal income tax bracket with taxable accounts and lots of capital gains to offset could benefit from the TLH capabilities of personalized indexing—with the highest benefit coming from daily TLH scanning.\\nExpressing ESG/SRI preferences. If clients have strong ESG or SRI convictions that require an increased level of precision to screen or tilt individual stocks, personalized indexing could be a solution.\\nApplying factor exposures. You can easily tilt a portfolio to incorporate traditional risk factors such as momentum or value. Personalized indexing gives you the control to express specific market views or outlooks for your clients, or to diversify factor exposure around a client\\'s broader portfolio.\\nDiversifying a concentrated position. You can build tax-efficient completion portfolios around large existing stock holdings at the individual security level.\\n\\nConsider how personalized indexing technology might help you differentiate your practice while giving appropriate clients the tax-efficient, customized investing experience they expect.

Our user-friendly software lets you generate custom SMAs in minutes and generate impact and performance reports on demand.

We\\'re keeping a close eye, however, on interest rates, monetary policy, and their potential growth effects.\\n\\nRisks to growth specifically from oil prices have moderated in recent weeks, with oil trading within the $95 to $105 per barrel range that we see as consistent with above-trend 2022 GDP growth.\\nGDP grew at an annual rate of 6.9% in the fourth quarter, up from 2.3% third-quarter growth, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis final estimate.\\nFor all of 2021, real GDP grew by 5.7%, compared with a contraction of 3.4% in 2020, when the pandemic set in.\\n\\nEuro area\\nThe growth environment in the euro area is challenged by the war in Ukraine, the resulting higher energy prices, reduced confidence, and somewhat tighter financial conditions. We continue to foresee full-year growth in a range of 2.5% to 3.0%, lower than our outlook before the war for growth around 3.5%.\\n\\nConsumer confidence at its lowest since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and diminished business confidence help inform our view, as do the somewhat offsetting effects anticipated from additional fiscal stimulus.\\nFor the fourth quarter, GDP grew by 0.3% on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with the third quarter.\\n\\nChina\\nWorsening COVID-19 outbreaks have led to lockdowns affecting more people in China than at any other point since 2020 and purchasing managers\\' index readings imply that a sharp economic slowdown took hold in March.\\n\\nChina set an official 2022 growth target \"around 5.5%\" at the early-March National People\\'s Congress, the lowest growth target it has ever set. Vanguard maintains its forecast for 2022 China growth around 5%.\\nFiscal and monetary stimulus early in the year boosted the economy in January and February, offsetting the March weakness.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nVanguard continues to see economic growth around 5.5% in emerging markets broadly in 2022, but high food and energy prices related to the war in Ukraine place risks firmly to the downside.\\n\\nEnergy prices have risen steadily since the start of the year but have moderated at elevated levels recently. And although higher commodities prices do benefit some emerging economies, they\\'re a negative taken in the aggregate.\\nHigher food prices have stoked tensions in some emerging markets.\\nExpectations for central bank rate cuts next year in economies that have raised rates this year speak to the slowdown risk.\\n\\nEnergy, food, and housing costs drive inflation higher\\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States rose by 8.5% in March compared with a year earlier, higher than a 7.9% year-on-year gain in February. That gain alongside a seasonally adjusted month-on-month gain of 1.2% was largely in line with market expectations.\\n\\nGasoline, food, and shelter contributed the most to the broad increase. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 6.5% compared with a year earlier.\\nSeparately, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation indicator in considering monetary policy, rose 0.4% in February, a slower pace of increase than the 0.5% reading in each of the four preceding months.\\nVanguard believes that core inflation may have neared its peak, but that elevated headline inflation, reflecting not just high energy prices but also accelerating food prices, is likely to be an increasingly important factor in the Federal Reserve’s policy calculus.\\n\\nInflation and wage pressures prompt Fed action\\nAccelerating inflation and a still-tightening labor market have led us to revise our view on the Federal Reserve. We foresee the equivalent of six to eight 25-basis-point hikes to the federal funds rate target in 2022, with the potential for one or two 50-basis-point hikes in the mix. (Any 50-point hike would count as two of our anticipated 2022 hikes.)\\n\\nThe change of view is a bringing forward of anticipated rate hikes from 2023 into 2022. We continue to foresee a terminal rate around 3%, though we\\'re evaluating inflation, wage, and labor-market conditions for evidence that an even higher terminal rate may be in order.\\nAs early as its May 4 meeting, the Fed could announce that it will start to reduce its balance sheet by a level that would quickly rise to as much as $95 billion per month.\\nShould investors adjust their portfolios in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve enacting the first in what is likely to be a series of interest rate hikes? For most investors, the answer will be no, other than regular rebalancing. But history shows that certain sub-asset classes have consistently outperformed during rising real rate environments.\\nThe current environment may present opportunities for those investors who have the ability and willingness to take some active risk and be a little more targeted in their approach.\\n\\nProlonged and persistent periods of real rate increases favor some sub-asset classes\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bloomberg; CRSP; Kenneth R.

The net impact on global GDP is negative, however, in all scenarios.\\nIn the best-case scenario, if countries and companies align to adhere to the 1.5 degree Celsius target versus pre-industrial levels set by global policymakers in the Paris Agreement,1 our forecast is for a net drag of around 2%–4% on global GDP by 2050. In the worst-case scenario, where policymakers make no additional progress to reduce emissions and temperatures rise by more than 3 degrees, the global economy could see a net drag closer to 10%. (See figure below.)\\nThe net impact of climate change on global GDP by 2050\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nIn the coming decades, the effects of climate change on the global economy and financial markets will not follow a straight line. We expect significant regional disparities, and the possibility of climate-related economic shocks. Investors may experience periods of heightened volatility in the financial markets as the effects of climate change become more apparent through events such as storms, droughts, flooding, heat waves, and wildfires. Policy measures aimed at combating climate change can hamper economic growth too, particularly if those measures are late, abrupt, or reactive rather than early, transitioned, and thoughtful.\\nOf course, efforts by consumers, businesses, and policymakers to address climate risk offer investors opportunities as well. As our economic analysis indicates, significant investments will be required in the decades ahead to change how power is generated, buildings are constructed, agriculture is managed, and goods are shipped to achieve policymakers\\' goals. While transition effects, market changes and regulations may provide headwinds for some, this transformation will spur new technologies, markets, and growth opportunities for others.\\nWays Vanguard is mitigating climate risk\\nCommitting to working with policymakers on behalf of long-term investors\\nVanguard is committed to working with policymakers to represent the best interests of investors. While companies, asset managers, and individual investors can all play a role in mitigating climate risk, we firmly believe that governments must lead the way. Government leaders are specifically empowered and charged with considering competing interests and crafting public policy that will address complex societal impacts and make the appropriate tradeoffs. Government action may also have the added benefit of applying equally to relevant entities such as private companies and state-owned enterprises. Our hope is that policymakers will set long-term expectations that provide clarity to individuals, companies, and the financial markets as to government plans and targets.\\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement remains the most referenced example of an inter-governmental climate change agreement that has resulted in commitments and targets for countries and companies to meet. Vanguard expects the companies that our funds invest in to follow applicable climate rules and commitments set forth by policymakers in their respective jurisdictions, and to plan appropriately for emerging risks and regulation in this area. We engage with the companies in our funds\\' investment portfolios accordingly.\\nStill, significant opportunities remain for policymakers to develop the frameworks and mechanisms that will enable markets to function effectively in the coming years. For example, despite a number of domestic and regional initiatives, the global capital markets continue to lack specific policy direction and clarity from policymakers about the best way forward. Options abound, each with its own trade-offs and challenges. These range from a standardized mechanism for pricing carbon, to consistent taxonomies for \"sustainable\" investing, to specific pathways for aligning with the agreed upon goals of the Paris Agreement. Governments, companies, and financial market participants also lack a single global standard for climate risk reporting, which could provide stakeholders with information that is consistent, comparable, and therefore more useful for decision-making. Given the global impact of climate risk, we are hopeful that governments will act individually and collectively with these long-term realities in mind.\\nAt Vanguard, we know we don\\'t have all the answers. But we do understand how to help long-term investors manage risk and meet their financial goals—and that\\'s how we approach this challenge for our clients.\\nInvesting and engaging\\nAs a fiduciary, Vanguard views climate risk, like other risks, through the lens of financial materiality for long-term investors. Our investment stewardship teams have ongoing engagements about climate risk with the companies our funds invest in, particularly as our index funds are near-permanent shareholders on behalf of our 30 million investors. (By design, an index fund will hold the shares of a company for as long as it is included in the benchmark index.)\\nThrough engagements with company boards and management—and through proxy voting on behalf of Vanguard\\'s internally managed equity funds—Vanguard\\'s Investment Stewardship team encourages companies to have sound risk management practices, including with respect to climate risk. For companies where climate risk is a material risk, this includes effective oversight of climate risk at the board level, risk mitigation targets that are aligned with the Paris Agreement, and disclosure of progress against those risk mitigation targets.\\nOn behalf of investors in our index equity funds, we must stay invested in constituent companies.\\xa0 We believe that encouraging these companies to take positive action on material climate risks can deliver long-term sustainable value and real economic impacts. This approach can be more effective than (1) divesting from these companies by selling them to other owners who may be less interested in sustainable, long-term value creation; or (2) investing solely in green start-ups.\\nOur approach boils down to a belief that responding to risk, including climate risk, requires a responsible, long-term perspective—and we do not believe wholesale divestment is a productive way to safeguard the long-term investment returns of our clients. Vanguard Investment Stewardship regularly publishes perspectives, policies, and reports to keep investors informed of our approach and activities.\\nProviding information and choices for our investors\\nAt Vanguard, our investors are our owners and they always come first.2 We aim to provide investors with the insights they need to make well-informed decisions. We believe that investors are best served by diversified portfolios that include appropriate allocations to the broad global stock and bond markets. For some investors, however, owning certain companies is not consistent with their values or preferences. This is particularly true in the context of climate change, which is why we offer passively managed environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds that enable investors to avoid companies in the fossil fuel value chain.\\nThere are also investors who prefer to invest in companies with leading sustainability practices. For them, we offer actively managed funds that choose to invest in companies deemed to have leading ESG practices.\\nIn addition, given the growing importance of climate risk, many managers of our other active funds—even those that don\\'t explicitly target sustainability—take ESG factors, including climate risk, into consideration in their engagement practices and security selection because these factors can materially impact a company\\'s future revenue and liabilities. We believe this is just good risk management.\\nAdvocating for responsible action on climate risk\\nOver the years, we have worked with a number of organizations that encourage collaborative and constructive dialogue across our industry to safeguard long-term shareholder returns and encourage responsible action on climate change.\\nThey include the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), an organization we’ve supported since 2017. TCFD advocates for constructive climate-change disclosure practices that will help investors understand the material financial impacts of climate-related risks associated with the companies in which they invest. Such disclosures are making climate change a more prominent consideration in the business and investment decisions that companies make.\\nLast year, we joined the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. It consists of more than 200 global asset managers committed to supporting policymakers\\' stated goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner. As part of our commitment, Vanguard has pledged to engage with companies, policymakers, and other investment industry participants about this transition; publish annual TCFD disclosures to report on our progress; and provide Vanguard investors with information on net zero investing so they can make informed asset -allocation decisions.\\nDoing our part as a company\\nFinally, as a company of more than 18,000 employees in locations around the world, Vanguard has embraced our own sustainability goals. They include using 100% renewable energy, a milestone we first achieved in 2021, and reaching carbon neutrality throughout our own global operations in 2025.\\nOur corporate sustainability strategy balances growth and efficiency. To achieve carbon neutrality, we use a combination of tactics—operational enhancements to reduce our carbon emissions, investment in the sustainability of our global real estate portfolio, and the purchase of renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets.\\nWe will continue to report on progress against our corporate sustainability strategy, and on our efforts across Vanguard\\'s operations to address the risks of climate change.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The more popular ETFs become, the more important it is that investors use the right trading strategies. That\\'s particularly true of large trades, which can be quite complex and, if mishandled, can create negative consequences for advisors and client portfolios.\\nOne category of large trades that our ETF Capital Markets Desk gets a lot of calls about is rebalancing trades. Rebalancing trades recur regularly with the calendar—say, quarterly—or when markets are volatile. Advisors often ask how they can minimize transaction costs as they rebalance clients\\' ETF portfolios to achieve their targeted allocations.\\nWe understand the concern, because as investors continue to shift to ETFs, larger block trades are hitting the market more frequently.1 This means that getting the trading piece right is more important than ever.\\nIndustry mutual fund and ETF assets and net cash flows, 2012–2021\\nNotes: Mutual fund data are as of December 31, 2021, and exclude money market funds and funds-of-funds. 10-year net flows data cover 2012 through 2021.\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from Morningstar, Inc.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBig trades and small trades\\nJust as carpenters have unique tools in their toolbox for specific jobs, investors have different trading strategies at their disposal for different transactions.\\nWe want to equip you with the right tools so you can execute your next ETF order and incur the lowest transaction costs possible.\\nFirst, and crucially, big and small ETF trades are not handled the same way. We\\'ll distinguish between what we call \"low-touch\" and \"high-touch\" trades.\\nUsing the correct order type\\nGenerally, low-touch order types are used for smaller ETF trades, and high-touch order types are used for larger ETF block trades that could affect the ETF\\'s price.2 Broadly, low-touch trades can be self-provisioned by executing either limit orders or market orders. High-touch trades often require working with your custodian\\'s block trading desk to execute the ETF order with greater discretion.\\nLow-touch and high-touch ETF trades defined\\nLow-touch—common ETF order types\\n\\nMarket order: An order to buy or sell a security immediately at the best available current price. The priorities for this type of order are speed and execution, not price. These are popular among individual investors who want to buy or sell ETFs without delay. The primary risk associated with this order type is price impact.\\nLimit order: An order to buy or sell a security at no more or less than a specified price. This gives the investor some control over the price at which the trade is executed and can safeguard against unexpected market volatility.\\nMarketable limit order: A limit order that is placed for immediate execution. For a marketable buy limit order, the limit price is set at or above the Ask. For a marketable sell limit order, the limit price is set at or below the Bid.\\n\\nHigh-touch—common ETF order types\\n\\nRisk trade: A trade done with a market maker at a negotiated price for a block of ETF shares, where the market maker commits capital to facilitate the client\\'s order immediately. Generally, trades occur at a slight premium or discount to the quoted spread (NBBO) at the time of the trade.\\nAlgorithmic trades (algos): Trading strategies that use automated algorithms to try to achieve specific execution outcomes. Generally, trades are executed over a period of time and intended to minimize price impact in the market.\\n\\nVWAP trade—volume-weighted average price.\\nTWAP trade—time-weighted average price.\\nPOV trade—percent of volume.\\n\\n\\n\\nDeciding whether to use low-touch or high-touch order types depends on how big your planned trade is compared with the ETF\\'s liquidity profile. If the amount exceeds 5% of the ETF\\'s average daily volume, it\\'s important to pause to reflect on a few other considerations before submitting any kind of order. You may have experience submitting low-touch market orders in this scenario, but before doing so again, consider our preference for marketable limit orders. These are limit orders priced for immediate execution.3\\nBefore submitting a marketable limit order for a relatively large trade, though, make sure—whether you\\'re buying or selling—that enough shares are available in the secondary market to readily absorb the trade. So if you\\'re selling, the shares you plan to sell should not greatly exceed the shares on the bid, and if you\\'re buying, the shares you plan to buy should not greatly outsize the number of shares on the offer. If the size of your order greatly outsizes the market, you could potentially show too much information to the market, which could work against your execution quality.\\nIf the trade is much larger than the quoted size in the secondary market, you might still be able to execute a low-touch trade in the form of a not held limit order. Not held limit orders allow you to stipulate the price at which you\\'re willing to execute the trade and protect against unintentional price impact, while not revealing the full size of your trade to the market. So if bids or offers don\\'t materialize at your desired price, the trade won\\'t happen, thus avoiding any unexpected ETF executions.\\nBig trades often require high-touch orders\\nIf the trade size exceeds both 5% of average daily trading volume (ADV) and the quoted size available on the bid/offer, you may have to consider whether your order is large enough to result in the creation or redemption of ETF shares.4 If your ETF trade meets these criteria, you may want to consider working with your custodian\\'s block trading desk to execute the trade using a high-touch order type.\\nETF trading decision tree\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe power of order aggregation\\nWe occasionally see the same trading style applied to ETFs that was previously used for mutual fund portfolios—submitting batch orders all at once at the same time each day.5 Although this works for mutual funds priced once a day at the fund\\'s net asset value (NAV), it may not be the best solution for ETFs. Rebalancing numerous clients\\' portfolios and submitting countless low-touch trades for a single ETF at the same time runs the risk of affecting the ETF\\'s price and resulting in higher transaction costs for your end-clients.\\nOne useful trading technique that can make rebalancing ETF portfolios across numerous client accounts more efficient is ETF order aggregation—the simple concept of taking numerous orders on the same ETF and same side of the market and aggregating them into a single trade.\\nNot only does this minimize the operational challenges of submitting multiple trades across various client accounts, but it also provides more trade flexibility in using high-touch orders to help achieve the best execution.\\nTakeaways\\nThe great benefit of intraday trading should be balanced with the right trading strategy.\\nAs the use of ETFs increases and larger trades become more frequent, advisors have an opportunity to perfect how they approach big trades such as rebalancing trades. Advisors who weigh different trade considerations carefully to avoid any surprises and achieve the best execution can potentially increase the chances for optimal client outcomes.\\nVanguard\\'s ETF Capital Markets team is available to assist in trading and execution throughout the decision-making process, increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome. If you\\'re expanding your ETF business, consider reaching out to our Capital Markets Desk and using the ETF decision framework to avoid an unexpected ETF execution.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Market participants don\\'t always agree on what constitutes a block trade. Some exchanges define block trades as any trade over 10,000 shares, which can diverge from custodians\\' requirements. Each custodian\\'s definition of a block trade may differ and is often tied to the percentage of the ADV, share quantity, or dollar value of the trade.\\n2 Low-touch orders refer to \"held orders\" that are held to the national best bid and offer (NBBO) price. High-touch orders give your broker time and price discretion to execute the order and aim to achieve the best price available. They are also called \"not held\" orders since they are not held to the NBBO.\\n3 Vanguard\\'s ETF Capital Markets Desk typically suggests that investors consider using limit orders or marketable limit orders to avoid any unexpected ETF executions. In our view, marketable limit orders may represent the best of both worlds in that executions are quick and include safeguards that market orders lack.\\n4 ETFs are created and redeemed in unit sizes. Generally, 25,000 ETF shares is the minimum to facilitate a creation or redemption; however, creation unit size can vary by product.\\n5 Batch orders refer to the systematic submission of numerous low-touch (held) orders to the market all at once. This trading strategy can often affect the ETF price and signal the market if the trades are consistently submitted at the same time of day.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or ETF Shares, contact your financial advisor to obtain a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus. Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other important information are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing.\\nVanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of a client\\'s account. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet a client\\'s investment objectives or provide the client with a given level of income.

       "  'content': \"These days, you are no doubt talking to clients about what to do with the fixed income allocation in their portfolios.\\nConcerns about central banks' policy normalization in the face of high global inflation and market volatility, along with a rising interest rate environment, have combined to make the fixed income decisions you make for your clients tougher than ever.\\nStick with your plan … especially when it comes to bonds\\nThe benefits of bonds are timeless. They provide a buffer against equity market fluctuations, while producing income that can grow from the compounding effect of reinvested interest payments. It would be unusual indeed to have a portfolio without them.\\nAs you meet the challenges of creating thoughtful, well-diversified fixed income allocations for your clients, here are four strategies to keep in mind.\\n1. Stay diversified\\nBe clear on the role of fixed income in your clients' portfolios. Your clients should own bond funds as a diversifier to equity risk—even with interest rates moving higher. The chart below shows projected returns of various assets during the expected worst decile of monthly U.S. equity performance over the next 10 years.\\nBonds are still expected to cushion volatility\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. Distribution of return outcomes from VCMM are derived from 10,000 simulations for each modeled asset class. Simulations are as of December 31, 2021. Results from the model may vary with each use and over time.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2. Maintain a proper risk profile\\nLately, many advisors have chosen to shorten duration in order to reduce their clients' interest rate risk exposure, filling the yield gap with high-yield or emerging markets fixed income securities, for example, thus increasing credit risk. This may look great on paper, as these sectors are expected to earn, on average, higher returns. However, this approach can lead to a more equity-like fixed income portfolio that may not perform as well during a stock market correction or bear market.\\n3. Harness duration\\nAlthough it's a seemingly obvious decision, it's worth repeating: Construct portfolios tailored to the appropriate time horizon.\\nEven rising rates can be good for bond investors if their investing time horizon is longer than the portfolio's average duration. Higher yields on reinvested cash flow should outweigh market price declines. There may be some short-term pain, but your clients should be rewarded over time. If the investment horizon is shorter than the average duration of the portfolio, consider adjusting it to align the two more closely.\\n4. Take control\\nHow you implement the fixed income allocation of your client portfolios depends on how much control you want to have. You may choose to have full strategic control and make allocation decisions across the different sectors in fixed income. Alternatively, you might choose to hire an investment manager to do this for you. Or, depending on your expertise, you may choose to do something in the middle.\\nWhat's the bottom line?\\nFixed income investing is challenging these days. But it's not just fixed income investments that face headwinds in the markets. The next 10 years are probably not going to look like the last 10 years for any asset class.\\nWe believe maintaining portfolio diversification and the right risk profile, harnessing duration, and taking appropriate control of allocations can go a long way in helping you position your clients to achieve success.\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to learn more?\\nVisit our special active fixed income webpage for a wealth of resources.View webpage\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. VCMM results will vary with each use and over time.\\nThe VCMM projections are based on a statistical analysis of historical data. Future returns may behave differently from the historical patterns captured in the VCMM. More important, the VCMM may be underestimating extreme negative scenarios unobserved in the historical period on which the model estimation is based.\\nThe Vanguard Capital Markets Model is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguard's primary investment research and advice teams. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.\\nDiversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.\\nInvestments in bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.\\nHigh-yield bonds generally have medium- and lower-range credit quality ratings and are therefore subject to a higher level of credit risk than bonds with higher credit quality ratings.\\nInvestments in bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk. These risks are especially high in emerging markets.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'You\\'ve probably gotten a number of questions from your clients about personalized indexing (PI), also known as direct indexing, and its potential benefits. Interest in PI is certainly on the rise. Assets managed with a PI strategy grew more than threefold between 2015 and 2021, from $100 billion to roughly $350 billion—a pace that is expected to accelerate, with total assets managed with PI estimated to reach $1.5 trillion by 2025.1\\nBut the rising adoption of personalized indexing by mass-affluent and high-net-worth investors, and the sheer number of PI options available in today\\'s marketplace, raise many questions. Recent Vanguard research addresses two critical questions about using a PI strategy:\\xa0\\n\\nWhat\\'s the difference between similar PI implementations, including tax-loss harvesting (TLH) frequency?\\nHow can you help your clients incorporate PI into their portfolios, and how much personalization can they pursue without potentially lowering their expected returns?\\n\\nThe impact of tax-loss harvesting\\nPersonalized indexing strategies use tax-loss harvesting to help investors potentially earn better returns. Rather than owning a pooled product like an ETF or a mutual fund, investors own individual stocks that represent an index, such as the CRSP US Total Market Index, in separately managed accounts (SMAs).\\nPI software scans the portfolio for TLH opportunities at a set frequency, such as quarterly or monthly. Securities that drop below their cost basis are sold, and correlated (but not \"substantially identical\") replacement stocks are immediately repurchased to navigate the wash-sale rule.2\\xa0 This way, investors may capture the gains of the chosen index while harvesting losses that can offset capital gains at tax time.\\nTax-loss harvesting frequency matters\\nA key difference between personalized indexing implementations is how often they scan for tax-loss harvesting opportunities, ranging from once a year to daily. Our research found that more frequent scans lead to materially higher and more consistent loss harvesting. The differences in TLH alpha can be wide, ranging from 20 basis points (bps) to well over 100 bps for a prime PI investor with extensive recurring capital gains.3 Personalized indexing with daily tax-loss harvesting is critical to achieving the maximum harvest in \"typical\" (non-high) volatility environments.\\nAverage 10-year TLH alpha by harvest frequency\\n(Ultra-high-net-worth investor)*\\xa0\\n*Assumes quarterly contributions.\\nSource: Kevin Khang, Alan Cummings, Thomas Paradise, and Brennan O’Connor, 2022. Personalized indexing: A portfolio construction plan. Valley Forge, Pa.: The Vanguard Group.\\xa0\\nThe figure shows the average 10-year TLH alpha for each mode for UHNW investors. For UHNW investors with unlimited loss-offsetting income, TLH alpha rises from 1.64% for \"PI annually” to 3.10% for \"PI daily\"—a significant difference of 1.46%.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBuilding personalized indexing portfolios\\nA personalized indexing portfolio is an SMA based on a chosen market-capitalization-weighted benchmark. Investors can personalize their accounts to incorporate desired factors; tilts; and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or socially responsible investing (SRI) preferences or to account for concentrated positions.\\nA PI portfolio is flexible, but such \"active\" customizations typically run a tracking error between 75 bps and 275 bps, with 75 bps representing the minimum level of tracking error that can result from TLH using individual securities and navigating the wash-sale rule. Additional personalization for ESG and/or factors can cause tracking error to rise to 275 bps.4\\nHow much tracking error is too much?\\nAs our research points out, recommendations for how much personalization investors can pursue without sacrificing performance vary sharply by investor profile and PI alpha potential (a highly predictable quantity based on the investor\\'s capital gains profile). Investors with an expected PI alpha of 150 bps or more can largely replace their existing passive U.S. equity allocation with PI and personalize it freely,5 that is, up to 275 bps of tracking error, without having to change their overall asset allocation.\\xa0\\nFor investors with an expected PI alpha below 150 bps, however, personalization in PI may come at a cost. First, greater tracking error in PI calls for a lower allocation to equity and therefore a lower expected return from the entire portfolio. Second, as tracking error rises above 75 bps and the optimal equity allocation declines, the optimal mix between PI and passive may also change. Investors may want to lower their overall equity allocation to accommodate meaningful personalization in the personalized indexing portfolio.\\nExplore Vanguard Personalized Indexing\\nIf you have clients who could benefit from the tax optimization and customization features of personalized indexing, consider Vanguard Personalized Indexing (VPI).

Vanguard expects the Fed to keep an especially watchful eye on wages during this period. Higher pay takes longer to establish itself in an economy than broader price increases, but when it does, it can precipitate further inflation, which can lead to even higher pay in a cycle that threatens to repeat itself.\\nA new analysis by Adam Schickling, a U.S.-based Vanguard economist, underscores the significance of compensation metrics today. Using a Vanguard model, Schickling forecasts that the U.S. \"quits rate\"—the Bureau of Labor Statistics\\' measure of employee-initiated job separations—is likely to remain elevated for the rest of the year, as is highly correlated wage growth.\\nResignations are on the rise in a strong economy\\nNotes: The quits rate, taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\\' monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary, is depicted from December 31, 2004, through February 28, 2022. Vanguard\\'s quits rate forecast is through December 31, 2022.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAs the chart above shows, quits rates have been low when economies have been weak, such as during the global financial crisis and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. People typically don\\'t leave jobs if they don\\'t already have another lined up or are pessimistic about the economy, Schickling noted. Quits rates have been correspondingly higher in stronger economies.\\nThe pandemic sent millions of older workers into an earlier-than-anticipated retirement, one of several reasons for the labor shortage that is adding to inflationary concerns. Schickling expects only around 20% of those early retirees to return to the workforce this year and only around 40% ever to return, exacerbating labor market tightness that creates the conditions for what has become known as the Big Quit, or the Great Resignation. Many of these retirees have realized they don\\'t need to return to work immediately, because they have accumulated savings (benefiting from elevated asset prices), their spouses still work, or they\\'re eligible for pensions or government benefits, he said.\\nAs job turnover has increased, so has compensation\\nNotes: Each dot represents a reading of the quits rate, taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\\' monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary, plotted against the corresponding month\\'s wages and salaries reading from the bureau\\'s Employment Cost Index. The five circled dots represent the most recent readings.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data through February 28, 2022.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThis chart shows the strong relationship between the quits rate and compensation. \"It\\'s very logical that higher rates of quitting are generally going to mean higher wage growth,\" Schickling said. \"Quitting is going to happen when the economy is strong. And when the economy is strong, employers are competing for labor.\"\\nSo the Federal Reserve, which is on record saying that a healthy labor market is contingent on price stability, may find its calculus governed by wage growth. \"If quits rates stay elevated throughout the rest of the year,\" Schickling said, \"we would expect nominal wage growth to stay around 5%, and that poses some challenge to breaking the dynamic of a wage-price spiral.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFragile—handle with care\\nBond returns plunged near record lows to begin 2022.

       "  'content': 'The recent flattening of the U.S. yield curve has left many investors wondering whether a recession is on the horizon and whether they should adjust their portfolios in response. But investors should not overreact, according to Andrew Patterson, senior international economist in Vanguard Investment Strategy Group, and John Madziyire, head of U.S. Treasuries/TIPS in Vanguard Fixed Income Group.\\n\"In the past, inversions of the yield curve have been reasonably reliable indicators of recession,\" Patterson said. \"But interpreting the signals can be challenging, particularly in an environment like this with so much uncertainty over inflation, Federal Reserve policy, the labor market, and now the war in Ukraine. Against this unusual backdrop, we need to be careful in drawing parallels to history.\"\\nYield curves normally slope upward because investors naturally demand a higher return for tying up their principal for longer periods. Longer-term bonds carry a greater risk of exposure to inflation. A steepening curve signals expectations for a healthy economy, whereas a flattening of the curve and, beyond that, an inversion reveal some concerns.\\nRecession isn\\'t a foregone conclusion\\nHistorically, an inverted yield curve—where the yield on longer-term Treasury bonds is lower than that of shorter-term Treasury bonds—has foreshadowed a recession in the next year or two. The inversion implies that investors\\' outlook for the economy over longer periods has deteriorated compared with their near-term views.\\nBut there are several other reasons why part of the yield curve has flattened. The Fed has embarked on quantitative easing (QE) during the last two interest rate cycles. The first came in response to the global financial crisis and the second to the COVID-19 pandemic. As shorter-term Treasury rates approached zero, the Fed could stimulate the economy only by lowering yields on the long end of the curve, thus creating a flatter curve.\\nIn the post-COVID cycle, accelerated QE plus strong demand for Treasuries from overseas markets and pension funds have helped drive down longer-term yields.\\nNow the uncertainty over how much the Fed will continue to tighten monetary policy is flattening the curve, this time by short-term rates rising more than longer-term rates. \"The Federal Reserve has already signaled its plans to raise rates above the neutral rate to about 2.75%,\" Madziyire said. \"The risk is that with inflation already running at a 40-year high, the Fed may have to raise rates higher than anticipated.\"\\nThe result has been a rapid narrowing of spreads between 2-year and 10-year Treasury bonds, to just 6 basis points on March 29.1\\n\"With the Fed just starting to raise the federal funds rate, a 6-basis-point spread is significantly narrower than normal at this early stage of the cycle,\" Madziyire said. \"Many investors may think a recession is a foregone conclusion.\"\\nThe spread between the 2-year and 10-year Treasuries is at historic lows at this stage of the rate hike cycle\\nNote: A spread is the difference between the yield of a bond with one maturity compared with a bond of another maturity.\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data as of March 1, 2022, from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the National Bureau of Economic Research.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBut Madziyire noted that yield curve inversions have typically happened further into an economic expansion when rates were already relatively high.\\nPatterson echoed the point: \"Today we\\'re talking about inversions when the federal funds rate remains very close to zero, certainly below anything most people would estimate to be a neutral rate,\" he said.2\\nThe spread between 3-month and 10-year Treasuries may be a better indicator of an economic slowdown—and that spread isn\\'t sending recessionary signals, Patterson said.\\n\"Because the 3-month Treasury is much shorter than the 2-year, it is much more sensitive to Fed policy and reflective of current economic conditions, so its narrowing spread with the 10-year is generally a better indicator of potential recessions,\" he said. \"The 3-month/10-year spread has actually widened in recent weeks, and the yield curve has steepened at the shorter end.\"\\nMixed signals from a rising, flattening yield curve\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhat investors might do next\\nMadziyire said he and his team have been overweighting 10-year bonds and underweighting 2-year bonds. \"Given the expected market reaction to the recent and upcoming Fed moves, we expect the rate at which the 2-year goes up to be faster than the rate at which the 10-year bond rises,\" he said.\\nHe added that investors should continue to hold fixed income in their portfolios despite the short-term challenges associated with a rising rate environment. Short-duration bond portfolios will do relatively well in a diversified portfolio in such an environment because they are less sensitive to rising rates. But even when stock returns and bond returns decline in tandem, bonds provide diversification benefits, as the magnitude of losses in fixed income portfolios is often significantly less than that of stocks.\\nRising interest rates can be good for bond investors and savers, as current and future income benefits from being reinvested at higher rates.\\n\"Fixed income investors may feel some pain in the short term,\" Madziyire said. \"But if you are a long-term investor, higher yields mean more income.\"\\n\\xa0\\n1 A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\\n2 The neutral rate is typically defined as the equilibrium federal funds rate at which policy is putting neither upward nor downward pressure on the economy.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nFragile—handle with care\\nBond returns plunged near record lows to begin 2022.

Our economic and market outlook for 2022 discussed policymakers\\' delicate balance between keeping inflation expectations anchored and supporting economic growth.\\nConsumer prices that have since reached multidecade highs globally, exacerbated recently by elevated oil prices related to Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, have attuned markets to the reality that inflation won\\'t come down magically.\\nCentral banks no doubt have a challenge ahead. We believe the Fed will eventually need to raise the federal funds rate target to 3%, if not higher. Yet we also believe that higher interest rates will cool, but not stop, labor market strength and economic growth.

Central banks have found themselves challenged, since the global financial crisis, to push inflation up toward 2% targets. For much of that time, their concern has been deflation, not inflation.\\nAnd for several years, central banks have had reason to keep borrowing terms easy, the most recent and pronounced being the need to support economies that the COVID-19 pandemic had shut down. Recent high inflation caused by lingering pandemic supply constraints and surging demand—especially for workers—accentuates a needed end to accommodative policy.\\nCOVID-19\\'s legacy won\\'t be persistently higher inflation\\nHigher interest rates may bring volatility. The segments of the equity market that have benefited from low interest rates—U.S. stocks, especially large-capitalization and growth stocks—reached valuations not justified by their fundamentals and now face headwinds. But other equity market segments—such as small-cap, value, and developed markets outside the United States—appear fairly valued in a still-growing economy. Although the values of existing bonds decline as rates rise, coupons of new bonds will pay at higher, healthier rates.\\nWe believe that central banks will do the hard work necessary to bring inflation back toward target levels in the years ahead.

       "  'content': \"Today, a growing number of your clients wish to invest in companies that reflect their values, especially with respect to social and sustainability issues.\\nFund providers have met—and in many ways fueled—this demand for sustainable investments by launching a flurry of products that include ESG considerations in their investment processes. Although many of these funds wear the “ESG” label, they can vary widely in their objectives, strategies, and levels of complexity. The proliferation of ESG products and approaches, along with a lack of standardized terminology to describe them, has been a growing source of confusion.\\nUnderstand the methodology behind various ESG product approaches \\nWhether they’re managed actively or passively, ESG funds generally fall into one of two categories based on their approach: exclusionary or inclusionary. Exclusionary ESG funds use screens to exclude sectors, countries, or companies that do not align with certain ESG criteria. Inclusionary ESG funds aim to include companies that meet certain ESG standards based on ESG ratings, data, and/or the asset managers' proprietary assessments.\\nAs the ESG market is still evolving, there is no universally accepted taxonomy for ESG funds. Even so, the four categories described here are a useful starting point for understanding the types of ESG funds that are available today.\\n\\xa0\\nFour categories of ESG products1\\n\\xa0\\n\\nExclusionary. These funds aim to track an index that excludes sectors or industries based on their business involvement or activities. Examples can include oil companies, weapons manufacturers, chemical companies, alcohol producers, tobacco companies, and companies that do not meet minimum human rights standards.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nInclusionary. These funds can be managed passively or actively. Passive inclusionary funds aim to track an index that includes companies based on ESG ratings, the criteria of the index provider, and/or the proprietary assessment of the asset manager. Actively managed inclusionary funds explicitly look at ESG factors to identify the potential for maximizing long-term financial value. They may employ some level of top-down sector screen, but they predominantly use bottom-up evaluation techniques that focus on a company’s business fundamentals. As with all active funds, these come with active risk. Since inclusionary funds vary widely in how they assess ESG criteria and in the ESG outcomes they aim to achieve, investors should take time to evaluate the security selection process of active products and the index construction process of passive products.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nImpact. This type of inclusionary fund has an explicit dual mandate: to produce a measurable positive financial return and a measurable positive environmental or social impact. The manager documents both the returns of the portfolio and any positive ESG impact achieved. These funds are typically actively managed, so they come with active risk. What’s more, their dual mandate can require additional due diligence to determine whether they are delivering the positive impact their investors seek.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThematic. This type of inclusionary fund can be managed passively or actively. Passive thematic funds are designed to track an index made up of companies whose businesses support specific ESG themes. Examples include clean tech, green real estate, sustainable forestry, organic agriculture, education, and health care. Index thematic funds are typically less diversified than non-thematic ESG index funds and can be highly complex in how they are managed and maintained. Active thematic funds aim to beat market returns by investing in companies within a given theme, such as climate change, social justice issues, or equitable pay policies. Active thematic funds come with active risk and require due diligence to understand the security selection process.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nESG investing is not a one-size-fits-all solution\\n\\xa0\\nWhen employed thoughtfully and with an appreciation for their many nuances, ESG products can offer your clients a way to reach their financial goals while staying true to their values. Certain types of ESG funds may even be able to achieve a quantifiable positive impact in a particular area of social or environmental concern.\\n\\xa0\\nThat said, ESG investing is not a one-size-fits-all solution. When selecting an ESG fund consideration should be given to how it fits into a client’s broader financial plan, the potential advantages and limitations of the strategy the fund employs, and a realistic expectation for any ESG outcomes they hope to achieve.\\n\\xa0\\n1 This information is intended for educational purposes for investors. These are examples of general strategy and criteria that can be used for ESG investing. The advisors of Vanguard ESG funds may not apply this same strategy or criteria. Vanguard does not currently employ all of these methods. Please refer to a fund’s disclosure documents for additional details on the specific fund strategies.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'Updated April 29, 2022\\nInvestors with bond-centric portfolios are likely feeling fragile after unusually poor first-quarter returns. Here are a few tips for handling them with care.\\n\\nThe first-quarter 2022 market downturn squeezed equity and fixed income asset classes alike. This less common market event of both negative stock and bond returns likely affected all investors, but its impact may have gained special notice from conservative, bond-centric investors because they also have the highest loss aversion.\\nYou might find it beneficial to reach out proactively to your most conservatively invested clients, as they may be less accustomed to simultaneous stock and bond drawdowns of the magnitude we just witnessed.\\nAs their advisor, you\\'ve spent a great deal of time building a strong relationship with your clients to gain their trust and develop a thoughtful financial plan. One unfavorable quarter should not trigger a change to that plan if it was appropriate going into the year. Educating your clients on the frequency and magnitude of these types of events—and keeping their long-term objectives in focus—can help them maintain perspective and stay committed to their plan.\\n\\nPerhaps you remember as a kid trying to play the piano, throw a ball, or some other activity that required more developed motor skills. If so, you likely also remember how one side or muscle became much stronger and more adept than the other. Similarly, as an investment behavioral coach, you\\'ve possibly grown quite proficient in helping your more aggressively allocated, equity-centric clients \"stay the course\" in equity bear markets.\\nBut like a right-footed soccer player who has the chance to score the winning goal—with his left foot—advisors are now being confronted with the need to conduct unfamiliar conversations with their most conservatively invested, bond-centric clients.\\nThat\\'s because, generally speaking, bonds have experienced a 40-year bull market—there\\'s seldom been bad news to communicate, but the first quarter of 2022 delivered some of history\\'s worst bond returns, in addition to negative stock returns. This year\\'s first-quarter drawdown of –5.9% ranks as the third-worst quarter for bonds in the last 50 years.1 As a result, for the first time in a long time, you will likely need to place greater emphasis on coaching your more conservatively invested clients.\\nThese more loss-averse investors may feel an elevated state of anxiety and unease—and will need to be approached with care and empathy. Following, we provide some context on how this unusual quarter shaped up, along with a few pointers to help guide your conversations with clients.\\nBuckle up—conservative investors likely to find the quarter unsettling\\nTypically, the greatest pain in a portfolio comes to those investors more heavily weighted toward equities and other risky assets. However, in the first quarter of 2022 both stocks and bonds had negative returns—so, conservative investors have experienced a drawdown that is much less common for them. In fact, bond returns for the quarter were worse than stocks. In the past 50 years, an investor with a 30/70 stock/bond mix has only experienced three worse quarters.1\\nThis differs markedly from the experience of a more aggressive 70/30 investor.\\xa0 They\\'ve experienced similar or worse quarterly performance 23 times, or, on average, every two to three years. Said a different way, the conservative 30/70 investor just experienced a return of –5.7% that would rank near the bottom percentile over the last 50 years.1  To put that in context, the same percentile loss for a more aggressive 70/30 investor would be a much larger –13.0%;2  instead, the first quarter of 2022 saw the 70/30 investor \"only\" experience a –5.5% drawdown (see chart below).\\nFor your conservatively invested clients, it\\'s a matter of helping them put things into perspective. Historically speaking—yes, bonds saw one of their worst quarters. But comparatively speaking, when equities are in a bear market, they tend to fare much worse. Also, you can point out that this type of performance from bonds has, so far, proven exceedingly rare.\\nA tale of two return profiles—mostly bonds versus mostly stocks\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nNotes: The 30% stock/70% bond and 70% stock/30% bond portfolios comprise the Spliced US Bond and Spliced US Equity return series, weighted according to their respective stock and bond allocations.

Stock portion of portfolios is composed of Spliced US Equity as represented by the FT Willshire 5000 Index from April 1, 1972, to June 30, 1994; MSCI USA Investable Market Index from July 1, 1994, to June 30, 2001; and CRSP US Total Market Index thereafter.\\nSources: Vanguard analysis of Morningstar Direct data, as of March 31, 2022.\\n\\nBond yields have risen in the past two years\\nAs shown below, during 2020, the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields were as low as 0.12% and 0.62% respectively, and at the end of the first quarter sat at 2.28% and 2.32%, respectively.\\xa0 Most of history has shown that remaining committed to one’s investment plan is likely a much better alternative to additional de-risking (such as moving further into bonds or money markets). This especially applies in real purchasing power terms. So, in addition to managing drawdown risk from the markets, the advisor and client should together balance and manage purchasing power risk—that is, the risk the investment portfolio does not keep up with inflation over a long time horizon.\\nIncrease in interest rates has led to higher current yields on fixed income\\nU.S. Treasury securities yields since mid-2019\\nNotes: Chart depicts the 3-month U.S. Treasury security yield, as represented by the market yield on U.S. Treasury securities at 3-month constant maturity; the 2-year U.S. Treasury security yield, as represented by the market yield on U.S. Treasury securities at 2-year constant maturity; and the 10-year U.S. Treasury security yield, as represented by the market yield on U.S. Treasury securities at 10-year constant maturity.\\nSources: Vanguard analysis of Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data, as of March 31, 2022.\\n\\nAs we know, when the financial markets are volatile, investors can feel strongly compelled to change their financial plan and their stated portfolio asset allocations to stem any perceived continued losses. Yet, it is often the case that staying the course is the better path in the long term. Often this doesn\\'t mean standing still, but taking the action of rebalancing into the underperforming asset class. It\\'s most often best to stick to the long-term plan that you and your client have built together, with changes being made because of changes in their goals, objectives, risk appetite, and other aspects of their life, not because of changes in the markets.\\nGetting the message across\\nFor some clients, the dynamics contributing to 2022\\'s disappointing first-quarter performance will seem evident and understandable. For others, especially those who viewed fixed income investments as drama-free safe havens, their quarterly statements may come as a shock.\\nWe recommend taking a proactive approach and reaching out to clients, if possible, before they call you. Here we offer a few guiding principles to help you structure your conversations:\\n\\nCommunicate from a place of empathy. Putting yourself in their shoes, you understand that investing in bonds has historically provided their capital with shelter from much of the volatility more common to riskier equities. You have an opportunity to put this atypical bond-market event into context for them—before conversations with their friends and family or reading news headlines prompts them to question their long-term investing plan.\\nTake care to avoid promissory statements. While your goal is to provide comfort and understanding, you also want to give clients a realistic picture about the future. And the truth is, none of us knows for certain what the future holds for the markets (thus, you\\'d do well to avoid statements such as, \"No need to worry, because the bond market has bottomed\"). You can think of every interaction with your clients as the opportunity to build or lose trust, credibility, and authenticity; it\\'s like a bank where you are depositing or withdrawing trust. Candor is a net contributor to your trust balance with clients.\\nFocus on the relationship between long-term risk and return premiums. Historically, stocks have provided higher returns than bonds or cash but have carried a higher degree of risk. If investors were not compensated for the additional risk they took over longer time periods, no one would buy the higher-risk assets. Such market pressure pushes down the price of these assets to a level where risk is eventually adequately priced into the market. Bonds, in turn, should also over longer periods provide higher returns and carry greater risk than cash. Again, you can remind clients that portfolio asset allocation balances principal risk and purchasing power risk—the risk that their balances lose value to inflation.\\n\\nProactively sharing how unique the quarter has been, while providing your empathy, care, and counseling, can go a long way toward helping your clients stick to their financial plans and keep their long-term goals on track.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Vanguard calculations using data from Morningstar, Inc., as of March 31, 2022.\\n2 Given recent concerns about rising inflation, we performed the same analysis using quarterly real returns (inflation adjusted) and found that results were largely consistent.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.\\nBond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time, and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer\\'s ability to make payments. Investments in bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.\\nDiversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Should investors adjust their portfolios in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve enacting the first in what is likely to be a series of interest rate hikes? For most investors, the answer will be no, other than regular rebalancing. But history shows that certain sub-asset classes have consistently outperformed during rising real rate environments.\\n\"Our research suggests that the current environment may present opportunities for those investors who have the ability and willingness to take some active risk and be a little more targeted in their approach,\" said Ian Kresnak, an investment strategist at Vanguard and a member of the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM) research team.1\\nRare conditions prompt action\\nKresnak noted that we are in an unusual market and economic environment, which is likely to mean that the Fed will raise interest rates over the coming years to levels not seen since before the global financial crisis. Although the recent events in Ukraine and uncertainty about the effects policy normalization will have on the broader economy raise the risk that rates may not rise as much as we anticipate, it is unlikely that they will stay at or below current levels due to high inflation rates.\\nThis environment is likely to lead to rising real interest rates, which differ from nominal interest rates in that real rates are adjusted to remove the effects of inflation. The VCMM team investigated how some sub-asset classes performed during rising real rate environments and what drove performance. Given Vanguard\\'s expectation that the Fed may raise the nominal rate to 3%, the team focused on similar periods with relatively large rate hikes that also led to spikes in real rates.\\nThe analysis examined a mix of economic environments during which real rate increases occurred, including during an improving economy in 1992–1994 and a period of low growth and low interest rates in 2014–2019.\\n\"It was important to include a wide range of economic cycles to capture as many of the conditions that exist today,\" Kresnak said. \"This allows us to get a better understanding of how and why different sub-asset classes performed.\"\\nThree key findings\\nThe team\\'s research resulted in three key findings:\\n\\nCertain sub-asset classes have consistently outperformed, and some have consistently underperformed. The chart below shows how 13 common sub-asset classes in investors\\' portfolios performed over six periods when real rates rose. The sub-asset classes that outperformed on average also tended to outperform across the six periods. The same was true for those sub-asset classes that on average underperformed, as they consistently underperformed across the different environments when real rates rose.\"Although it is not a perfect relationship, there is a clear pattern that exists between rising real rates and sub-asset class performance,\" Kresnak said. \"When real interest rates are rising, investors tend to prefer the certainty of more immediate cash flows in their equity portfolios, which is what we typically see in high-quality value stocks, the best-performing sub-asset class during rising real rate environments.\"The VCMM team found that the relationship between rising real rates and performance is stronger with bonds than with equities, given the more fixed nature of bonds\\' cash flows.\"Equity cash flows are more uncertain, and performance tends to be influenced more by other factors, such as the business environment,\" he said. \"In general, bonds tend to be adversely affected in a rising real rate environment.\"\\n\\nProlonged and persistent periods of real rate increases favor some sub-asset classes\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bloomberg; CRSP; Kenneth R. French\\'s website, at mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html; Robert Shiller\\'s website, at aida.wss.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm; Standard & Poor\\'s; MSCI; Dow Jones; and Russell, as of December 31, 2021. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\n\\n\\nRising real rates hedge inflation. Despite the current high inflation, it may not be advisable to overweight traditional inflation hedges such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and commodities, Kresnak said. “Traditional inflation hedges have typically underperformed when real interest rates rise, because policymakers are acting with the goal of bringing down inflation, and investors generally believe they will succeed,” he said.\\nThe growth environment is not a distinguishing factor. Rising real rates typically are associated with improving economic conditions and higher inflation. But they can also rise because of excessive monetary tightening or deflation, which causes economic conditions to contract.The chart below compares performance in a rising real rate environment when economic conditions are contracting and when they are improving. It clearly shows a positive slope for most sub-asset classes, suggesting that relative performance is similar whether the economy is expanding or contracting, as long as real rates are rising. If economic conditions were a key driver of relative performance, we would expect the dots to be positioned along the solid diagonal line sloping downward.The analysis revealed three notable outliers—emerging markets, commodities, and high-quality value. Vanguard research shows that valuations for emerging markets stocks are sensitive to local economic environments, which were expanding while the U.S. was beginning to slow in the run-up to the global financial crisis.2\\xa0 The unexpected behavior of commodity returns has more to do with the short-term impact of the late-1970s oil crisis. When that period is removed from the sample, commodity returns are less responsive to changing economic conditions. Finally, high-quality value stocks tend to outperform when economic conditions are strong because investors are less willing to pay a premium for growth when it is plentiful.\\n\\nEconomic conditions don’t matter for most sub-asset classes when real rates rise\\nNote: Each dot represents a sub-asset class listed in the first chart. The dots are plotted based on their historical relative performance rank when economic conditions are expanding and when they are contracting. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, as of December 31, 2021.\\n\\nThe analysis also looked at sub-asset class performance during periods of rising and falling real interest rates. The negative slope in the chart below suggests that changes in real rates are a significant factor in explaining relative performance.\\nThe real interest rate environment is a key determinant of sub-asset class performance\\nNote: Each dot represents a sub-asset class listed in the first chart. The dots are plotted based on their historical relative performance rank when real interest rates are rising and when they are falling. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations; as of December 31, 2021.\\n\\nKresnak added that many sub-asset classes that stand to gain in a rising real rate environment have been out of favor for years. As real rates increase, the risks are that active investors will stick with the best active decisions of the past decade and that passive investors will fail to rebalance.\\n\"The opportunity is that the sub-asset classes that stand to gain the most from normalizing policy are more attractively priced precisely because they underperformed in the last decade,\" he said. \"In that sense, both active and passive investors stand to benefit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nInsights on the current market environment\\nCheck out our market volatility hub for the latest updates for you and your clients.View our insights\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n1 The VCMM is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguard\\'s primary investment research and advice teams.

The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.'},\n",

Then to round out this \"Building of the Agg\" approach, you will need to include an allocation to Mortgage-backed securities through VMBS our mortgage-backed Securities ETF. This set of building blocks will provide you with 97% coverage of the total U.S. bond market.\\nHere are some things to consider when using bond ETFs to build out the fixed income allocation of an investor\\'s portfolio. The longer the average maturity, the more likely you\\'ll see prices move up and down when interest rates change. Credit quality helps assess the chance that the bond will default. The better the credit quality, the less risk there is to your investment, especially during times of economic stress. Investment-grade refers to bonds with higher ratings from rating agencies such as Moody\\'s and S&P.\\nWhichever way you choose to get your bond exposure, make sure you consider Vanguard Bond ETFs.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Editor\\'s note: This research is the product of a team of Vanguard corporate credit analysts affiliated with Vanguard\\'s active taxable bond funds. The team\\'s insights are included in portfolio managers\\' bond selection in Vanguard\\'s actively managed taxable bond funds.\\n\\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 led to a pivot in the health care industry to accommodate the development and rollout of vaccines and therapeutic remedies; address the need for testing, detection, and care; and combat multiple variants of the disease.\\nAt the same time, the pandemic has sped up many secular changes that were already underway, such as telehealth, virtual visits, and online pharmacy distribution. We expect these changes to influence many companies\\' capital allocation and acquisition strategies as they evaluate the impact of secular changes on their core business and look for ways to participate in new growth areas.\\nOur base case is that, over time, health care companies will see a return to pre-pandemic patient utilization levels while continuing to focus on research and development as well as capturing growth opportunities that will come with an aging population.\\n\\nHow health care credit has fared during the pandemic\\nIn general, companies in this sector have had to work through modest fluctuations in demand but have proven resilient throughout the course of the pandemic. Furthermore, while health care labor shortages and supply chain and inflationary pressures are real, ongoing issues, they have not resulted in material credit impacts for the sector overall.\\nPharmaceutical companies have held up particularly well, even in the early days of the pandemic. While many parts of the global economy effectively shut down for a short period of time and experienced a rapid and severe contraction in demand, pharmaceutical companies were able to continue manufacturing their products to meet the largely stable demand for drugs, especially from patients already on medications.\\nFurther, as COVID-19 spread, a number of pharmaceutical companies took the opportunity to research and develop vaccines and treatments such as remdesivir while the rest of their business remained largely unscathed. Then the emergence of variants spurred demand for boosters and new treatments, resulting in material financial benefits.\\nSimilarly, many life sciences companies found opportunities to realize material financial benefits from the pandemic, notably from COVID-19 testing.\\nThat said, uncertainty remains around the magnitude and duration of these benefits, which have not, for the most part, accrued directly to bondholders. However, the added financial flexibility provided by these tailwinds has changed our view of certain credits, particularly those that were already trading at relatively tight spreads.\\nMoreover, it hasn\\'t all been rosy for the sector. At the onset of the pandemic, for example, deferred procedures resulted in an unprecedented deterioration in earnings and cash flow. Given the critical nature of the products and services provided, however, demand bounced back relatively quickly and has remained generally stable, even with the emergence of new variants. In addition, actions taken by both federal and state governments, such as keeping Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled without eligibility redeterminations and providing liquidity to health care providers via loans and grants, provided stability to the sector.\\n\"The chart below shows that pharma sales, which tend to be fairly stable, actually increased significantly in 2021 due in large part to COVID tailwinds,\" said Vanguard senior research associate Victoria Drecchio. \"And even sales for medical devices, a subsector which has had to navigate more headwinds such as deferred procedures, health care labor shortages, and supply chain pressures, held up well, and its sales are coming out of the pandemic stronger than they were going into it.\"\\nSales for pharma and medical devices proved resilient during the pandemic\\nNote: The sales figures shown are the sum of the largest five companies by market capitalization within our coverage as of January 19, 2022.\\nSources: Bloomberg, Company Reports, and Vanguard.\\n\\nQuantifying the sector\\'s resiliency\\n\"As the charts below illustrate, spreads of securities issued by health care and pharma companies over the past decade have generally traded tighter than those of the broader corporate bond market as a whole, whether you\\'re talking about investment-grade or high-yield,\" said Vanguard senior analyst Omar Sanders. \"Given the defensive nature of health care overall and the inelasticity of demand, the spread differential is most prominent during times of market stress, like that seen at the onset of the pandemic.\"\\xa0\\nIn the U.S., health care spreads tend to be tighter than for corporate bonds as a whole, especially in periods of market stress\\nSpreads for health care segments minus the average spread for corporate bonds\\nNotes: The spreads shown are all option-adjusted and as measured by the Bloomberg Corporate Bond Index for investment-grade bonds in the left-hand figure and the Bloomberg High Yield Index for high-yield bonds in the right-hand figure. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Data are from November 29, 2013, through February 9, 2022.\\nSources: Bloomberg and Vanguard.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\"In Europe, the performance story is very similar,\" said Vanguard credit analyst Johnny Will. \"The health care and pharmaceutical sectors have consistently traded inside the Pan-European corporate index, given the higher average ratings of the sector and defensive sector qualities. The same spike in outperformance is visible in the chart below at the start of the pandemic.\"\\n\\xa0\\nIn Europe, health care spreads have traced a similar path versus corporate bonds\\nNotes: The spreads shown are all option-adjusted and as measured by the Bloomberg Pan-European Aggregate Corporate Index. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The data are from November 29, 2013, through January 20, 2022.\\nSources: Bloomberg and Vanguard.\\n\\nThe road ahead for health care\\n\"Even with the widening in bond markets to start 2022, health care continued to outperform broader bond indexes,\" said Vanguard senior credit analyst Jamie Shin. \"We believe the industry\\'s strong fundamentals coupled with a more benign regulatory environment across most subsectors have contributed to the relative strength. For active managers that will make security selection even more crucial going forward.\"\\nAs we look for winners and losers in 2022, we will be focusing on the following themes:\\n\\nAccelerating innovation. Some trends that began or accelerated during the pandemic will continue to drive the direction and pace of innovation in the industry. Pharma and biotech companies will continue to invest aggressively in emerging therapy areas like cell and gene that became more mainstream due to COVID-19 research. This will create strong demand for R&D tools and support services—some provided by life sciences and medical devices companies, others provided by health care services companies. Health care providers are another subsector to watch. After seeing the rapid adoption of telehealth and decreases in ER admissions, health care providers will be looking for ways to offer care outside of the traditional hospital setting.We prefer companies with a track record of successfully sourcing and integrating growth assets and see some interesting opportunities in the life sciences, medical devices, and services subsectors.\\nPartnerships and smaller deals over megamergers. While companies remain interested in finding ways to supplement organic growth and capital markets remain favorable for the sector, most management commentary from a recent industry flagship conference focused on tuck-ins and partnerships rather than transformational deals. With large M&A transactions in 2021 facing regulatory scrutiny (such as UnitedHealth\\'s $13 billion bid for Change Healthcare, which the U.S. Department of Justice is suing to block) and examples of profitable partnerships without a huge investment up front (such as Pfizer and BioNTech partnering to develop a COVID-19 vaccine), companies are incentivized to look for smaller deals or partnerships over megadeals.While this is a favorable trend from a credit perspective as it reduces deal risk, we remain somewhat cautious on select pharmaceutical companies based on their historical preference for larger deals and stronger incentives to buy assets ahead of existing products’ patent expirations.\\nCost management. The emergence and subsequent waves of COVID-19 resulted in an unprecedented level of labor shortages in addition to cost inflation. This puts larger players with negotiating leverage and/or market density at an advantage over competitors.Efforts to manage costs will support demand for services from health IT providers and outsourced service providers (contract research and manufacturing services for pharma and biotech, contract labor for providers). As payors also look to manage increasing costs, there will be more interest in affordable alternatives such as private label products and lower-cost-of-care settings (those outside of hospitals).\\xa0\\nGreater private equity involvement. Private equity will continue to play an important role as both buyers and sellers. In 2021, we saw a private equity consortium strike a $34 billion deal to purchase medical distributor Medline in the largest leveraged buyout since the 2008 global financial crisis. With public companies shying away from larger deals, we could see private equity doing more and bigger deals than in the past. Private equity-driven deals are likely to have higher leverage and weaker creditor protections but can be interesting opportunities to get exposure to emerging growth areas while picking up yield.We expect higher levels of interest in health care services, given the focus on cost management, and will be looking for opportunities there while trying to avoid idiosyncratic risks such as customer concentration and excessively aggressive financial policy.\\n\\n\"At Vanguard, we have a global fixed income team of analysts, portfolio managers, and traders who use a bottom-up, fundamentals-based credit research process and a disciplined, collaborative approach to risk-taking,\" said Sanders. \"So we\\'re well-positioned for an investment environment like this for generating alpha through identifying securities that are likely to outperform and sidestepping those that are likely to disappoint.\"Active fixed income at Vanguard\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$335B\\nTaxable bond AUM 14* funds/1 ETF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$230B\\nMunicipal bond AUM 5 national funds/7 state-specific funds\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30+\\nPortfolio managers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30+\\nTraders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n60+\\nCredit research analysts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n140+\\nDedicated team members\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Includes funds advised by Wellington Management Company LLP.Note: As of December 31, 2021.\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nVanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars.

       "  'content': 'We recently shared our views on potential global economic effects of Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine. We described a situation where rising oil prices and tighter financial conditions would push growth lower and inflation higher.\\nWhy focus on these factors? And why make our forecasts conditional on their movements? Because in fast-moving, uncertain situations, it\\'s best to acknowledge what we don\\'t know and control for what we do know.\\n\"We\\'re the first to admit that we don\\'t know how the war is going to play out,\" said Shaan Raithatha, a Vanguard senior economist on the team researching the war\\'s economic effects. \"What we do know is that it will affect oil prices, and oil prices will affect global growth and inflation. So, we frame it in terms of oil prices in this range or that range. Similarly, the impact of financial conditions, depending on the scenario, is either going to be X, Y, or Z.\"\\nThe table below puts forth our views for a range of oil price and financial conditions scenarios.\\nAs oil prices rise and conditions tighten, global growth slows and inflation accelerates\\nNotes: The table presents just two of the most important factors Vanguard considers related to war in Ukraine—oil prices and financial conditions—and illustrates their expected impact on growth and inflation under four distinct scenarios. Other variables, not depicted, also factor into the analysis. The probabilities shown are as of the date of the analysis and are subject to change.\\xa0\\nSource: Vanguard analysis, as of March 10, 2022.\\n\\nAs the table shows, the scenarios we view as most likely—oil prices settling in around early March levels with limited to moderate tightening of financial conditions (such as increased borrowing costs)—would lead to consumer price inflation remaining elevated in 2022 and economies growing above or below trend but avoiding recession.\\nOur broad scenarios are global, though we do expect economic effects of the war in Ukraine to be felt more profoundly in the euro area than in other developed markets, given the region\\'s greater energy dependence on and proximity to Russia.\\nScenarios make sense today and every day\\nIn contrast to that of some forecasters, our approach acknowledges the significant role of uncertainty, especially in situations of some magnitude. Our focus on oil prices and financial conditions now is akin to our focus on vaccine efficacy and virulence of emerging variants in assessing potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\"With developments such as COVID-19 and now, unfortunately, the war in Ukraine, we think about economic outcomes in terms of scenarios,\" said Andrew Patterson, Vanguard senior international economist. \"Because of the uncertainty involved, we qualitatively and quantitatively work through multiple potential outcomes and try to assign probabilities to them. Our focus is pointed and situational.\"\\nVanguard doesn\\'t employ scenarios only in the context of history-defining events, however. The approach is just as valuable in the context of more commonplace uncertainty, such as that provided regularly by policymakers and the financial markets. For example, we present our long-term asset-return forecasts within a range of potential outcomes rather than as specific-point forecasts. We also present our optimal portfolios in the context of varying economic environments. (The Vanguard economic and market outlook for 2022 includes both our asset-return forecasts and our optimal portfolios.)\\nBut a scenarios-based approach is clearly prudent for the current challenge. \"As we continue to assess developments related to Ukraine under this framework, we will incorporate relevant and timely updates into our perspective,\" Patterson said. \"We took a similar approach during the pandemic, incorporating views on vaccines\\' efficacy, production, and distribution. We hope to incorporate details of a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine in our framework sooner rather than later.\"\\nNote:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Flows into exchange-traded funds have accelerated dramatically across the industry in recent years, making it impossible to ignore that something important is going on in public investment markets.\\nThe buzz clearly goes beyond last year's record ETF inflows of more than $900 billion—a figure that easily eclipsed 2020's record $500 billion. Over the past 10 years, inflows totaled a whopping $3.7 trillion. By comparison, net flows into open-end mutual funds over the same decade were $764 billion, about a fifth of the ETF total.1\\nAnd when you add market appreciation to the new money flowing into ETFs over that period, total ETF assets under management rocketed to $7.3 trillion at the end of 2021, from about $1.4 trillion at the end of 2011.\\nSo what's going on, and why should investors care?\\nTo begin, investors and advisors are waking up to what makes ETFs attractive—namely their trading flexibility, diversification, lower costs, and potential tax benefits. In sum, they're a powerful tool for constructing portfolios with relative ease. After three decades in the making, proof of the ETF concept is here in that ETFs have survived in all kinds of market environments.\\nFigure 1. Industry ETF inflows have soared over the last decade\\nETF annual cash flows in billions\\nNote: Each bar represents total inflows across all U.S.-listed ETFs as of December 31 of the year shown.\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from Morningstar, Inc.\\n\\nCore equities exposure led in 2021\\nThe 2,837 U.S.-listed ETFs at the end of 2021 reflect a wide variety of strategies, from broad total-market funds to factor-based ETFs to finely tuned thematic approaches, such as technology-focused strategies. Even actively managed ETFs are increasingly part of the ETF ecosystem, though investors have yet to fully embrace them.\\nBut sifting through the buzz and innovation around ETFs quickly reveals that inflows are mostly going into low-cost, indexed, core exposures. That was certainly the case in 2021, when 40% of all cash flows went into U.S.-focused ETFs that track the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and into total market index funds. In other words, the rise of ETFs is closely tied to the rise of indexing.\\nIn addition to U.S.-focused ETFs, investors are using ETFs to explore various pockets of the investment universe. For example, interest in international strategies blossomed in 2021—with inflows rising almost sixfold from 2020 levels, to $165 billion—as investors increasingly gravitated to non-U.S. equities amid attractive valuations.\\nFixed income ETFs have also grown more popular, garnering higher proportions of overall flows. Flows last year into bond ETFs—including municipal bond ETFs—were about even with their 2020 inflows, but the accelerating rise of bond ETFs in recent years has become a powerful part of the overall ETF adoption story.\\nFigure 2. Where the record ETF inflows are going\\nCash flows into U.S. equity ETFs were significantly higher in 2021 than for other ETF categories\\nETF net cash flows by asset class in billions\\nNote: Data cover total inflows across all U.S.-listed ETFs for calendar years 2020 and 2021.\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from Morningstar, Inc.\\n\\nThe bond ETF proof point\\nIt's worth noting that the introduction of bond ETFs in 2002 was accompanied by questions. The thinking went like this: Because buying and selling individual bonds can be difficult at the best of times, a bond ETF composed of myriad individual bonds might hit rocky shoals and become extremely difficult to trade when markets turn choppy.\\nBut that hasn't happened, for important conceptual and structural reasons, and a pair of market dislocations loom large as proof points. Bond ETFs weathered the 2007–2009 global financial crisis and, perhaps most important, were crucial components of the investing landscape during the February/March 2020 COVID-19-related crash—and afterward, they continued to thrive.\\nAs bond market liquidity grew scarce in the early weeks of the pandemic, bond ETFs trading in the secondary market ended up playing a vital price discovery role. Although bid-ask spreads on bond ETFs widened, as one would expect in a volatile market, they widened far less than the spreads of individual bonds. And trading never froze. In the end, bond ETFs were a critical source of liquidity, helping to keep the market of underlying bonds from seizing up. It's as if the presumed shortcoming of bond ETFs had been turned on its head. In addition, the Federal Reserve chose to fold corporate bond ETFs into its plans for expanded quantitative easing, signaling something more significant: ETFs are an integral element of contemporary financial markets.\\nETFs are here to stay\\nThe advantages of ETFs are clear—they include convenience and an improved client experience featuring low costs, a breadth of choices, and potential tax efficiencies. ETFs give investors relatively easy access to swaths of the investment universe both broad and narrow, with plentiful liquidity. Many of these conveniences extend to fixed income, and that's significant in that ETFs have made the careful calibration of credit risk, duration, and inflation protection in portfolio construction easier than ever before.\\nThe more assets that flow into ETFs, the more the advantages grow, from improved liquidity to lower costs of ownership.\\nFor advisors, efficient and scalable portfolio construction means more time for developing client relations. That's arguably one of advisors' most important functions, and one that Vanguard aims to help advisors optimize, particularly as ETFs' popularity keeps growing.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Morningstar, Inc., as of December 31, 2021.

       "  'content': 'Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley and Co-head of Emerging Markets Active Fixed Income, Nick Eisinger, discuss the impact of the war in Ukraine on emerging markets and how Vanguard is managing the associated risk.\\n\\nUkraine Crisis: Portfolio Perspectives\\nInsights from London\\nTim Buckley: Hello, I\\'m Tim Buckley, Vanguard\\'s CEO, and I\\'m joined by Nick Eisinger here in London. And Nick is the Co-Head of our Emerging Markets Fixed Income team.\\nNick, with Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, we have the tragic loss of life, of humanitarian crisis. We\\'ve seen extreme sanctions. We\\'ve also seen the markets react. Russian securities, whether equities or fixed income, have plummeted. In the coming days and through next week, we\\'ll see a lot of the Russian securities drop out of the major market indexes, first on the equity side, and then eventually on the fixed income side.\\nIf we go beyond, if we look beyond kind of the immediate impact in the markets, if we look broadly at EM, the world you live in, what are the knock-on effects? You haven\\'t really seen the same reverberations you might have expected with the outbreak of war in Ukraine.\\nNick Eisinger: Yes, thank you, Tim. We\\'re talking contagion to a broader emerging market universe. So far, pretty limited. Much more limited, for example, than the contagion effects post-COVID news. In many ways, much more limited around previous episodes of say taper tantrum from the Fed.\\nNow that doesn\\'t necessarily mean that we\\'re going to stay there because I think what we need to follow is whether there\\'s an escalation of the situation on the ground, how that plays out. That has particular poignance for the Central East European regions, some of the ex-Soviet Union countries, for obvious reasons, for geographical reasons. Economic linkages, obviously, with Russia are very strong there as well, as, indeed, are some political linkages.\\nThe other big factor, which is both in emerging market and the global factor is the price of oil, which is continuing to spike as we speak. That\\'ll help some emerging market countries, oil exporters. But on balance, if it\\'s going up quickly, it has big ramifications for global growth as well. And that\\'s generally not good for emerging markets.\\nSo when we observe the credit universe in EM right now, we see some early signs of contagion. We see some bonds selling off on a risk-adjusted basis. But we certainly don\\'t observe that, a big ramping up of the risk factors that are priced into that market at the moment.\\nTim Buckley: You deal in risk all the time. You deal with emerging markets. You deal with a lot more risk than most fixed income investors. There are always tail risks. The market\\'s got the intentions of Russia wrong in invading Ukraine. How do you think about tail risks, and as you develop a portfolio, because you won\\'t be right on all of them?\\nNick Eisinger: Of course. So tail risks, you know, it\\'s useful to sort of think of the definitions. A remote probability event but has very material implications to, in this case, portfolios.\\nAnd we really like to get away in the way we manage emerging markets from this concept of, \"My base case is this\" or \"My base case is that,\" because, inevitably, those are wrong.\\nBut the tail risk, in this particular instance, you know, is something you could not rule out. And so we spend a lot of our time interrogating alternative scenarios. We try to stress test the portfolio. Most obviously, at its most proximate set of events, so Russia and Ukraine exposures, as well as beyond that; and we come out of those stress tests, big collaboration with the risk group and our team and our own knowledge and our own sort of foresight, if you like, and experience. And we come up with a number, or at least we did back in November, that we thought was unacceptable for our portfolio and unacceptable that our clients should be bearing. And so from around November time, we started to really dial back in some of these exposures.\\nAnd the other interesting angle here is that had we got that wrong, we don\\'t actually think we would have necessarily lost out that much because particular Russian credits at that time were looking pretty expensive, to be frank with you. So there was some asymmetry, if you like, about disengaging from some of those trades.\\nThe other thing that\\'s closely associated with this is how you size trades in portfolios. So there\\'s going to be situations where you think you have to be particularly active. Part of our world, you have to be involved in some of these trades. But you want to size a portfolio based on that downside risk. And really what I mean by that is you don\\'t want a position to destroy your fund to such a degree that you\\'re never going to come back. And more importantly, your clients will never come back. So we spend a lot of our time thinking about concentration, correlated risks, downside scenarios. Of course, we think about upside scenarios as well. But it really shows you, I think, there is a very important consideration. You know, we do this weekly and then, more often than not, under situations like this, we do it with a lot more depth as well.\\nTim Buckley: Nick, your title says Emerging Markets, but I know your expertise goes far beyond that. Let me hit the developed markets. Anything you worry about there? You know, the Fed has stepped back from a 50-basis-point increase. Now that was what the market had priced in, and Chairman Powell essentially committed to a 25, at least his intentions for a 25-basis point increase. Does that worry you at all? Are there fears that we\\'re falling behind of inflation in some of the developed markets?\\nNick Eisinger: Yes, great question, Tim. I think that\\'s currently what the broader global market still focuses on, despite what\\'s going on closer to home, for us at least.\\nSo I think a lot of the rate hikes from the Fed are priced into the market. That would typically imply that as Powell goes in March, 25 basis points most likely, the market shouldn\\'t be overly concerned and trade particularly badly on that.\\nThe next question, of course, is what does it take for Powell to pivot the other way? And so it wasn\\'t very long ago the Fed pivoted to normalization. Sorry, guys, the tide\\'s going out. This is enough. We think it would take a pretty big shock that has the global ramifications for Powell and the FOMC to really step back. The biggest vex is, obviously, the oil price, a big spike and a prolonged spike in oil prices. The issue there really being what that does to the economic cycle.\\nSo we know that one thing you want to avoid when you run risk is recessions, and at the moment, you know, we still feel pretty comfortable; but the recession is a long way out. But, obviously, there are certain global shocks that can happen to bring that forward. So that\\'s the one thing I think at a global level you look at. So that\\'s the Fed\\'s dilemma, and perhaps it\\'s not that much of a dilemma right now.\\nThe ECB, back in Europe, however, I think faces a bigger dilemma. The ECB is much closer to potentially some bigger restrictions on energy, which has big inflation implications, at a time when inflation and core inflation across Europe is already high. We did see a mini pivot from the ECB similar to what the Fed was telling us, that it\\'s coming out of some of this QE. It\\'s going to start normalizing policy over time. That\\'s a much harder battle for it to fight at the moment.\\nNotwithstanding, we would still see the ECB as embarking from a gradual tightening path, less telegraphed perhaps, I\\'m afraid, but nonetheless, I think that\\'s where things are at the moment. And this is a difficult situation because, you know, the monetary support is arguably going out at the margin; and you\\'ve got a whole host of global risk events. But as I said, at the moment are somewhat contained; but we should not dismiss the risk that they could become uncontained in the foreseeable future.\\nTim Buckley: Nick, as always, thank you for the insights; and thank you for taking great care of our clients\\' money. And to all of our clients, thank you for your continued trust in Vanguard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow events in Ukraine change our economic views\\nHigher oil prices resulting from events in Ukraine are likely to trim economic growth and accelerate inflation to levels beyond what was previously expected.View article'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The initial impact on the global economy from the tragic events in Ukraine will be delivered primarily through higher commodity prices, according to a new analysis by Vanguard\\'s global economics team. The higher prices, most notably for energy, will hamper growth and cause broader prices to climb further than previously expected, according to the analysis.\\nTighter financial conditions, diminished consumer and business confidence, and elevated uncertainty will also have an effect, though to a lesser extent. The economic impact is likely to be more profound in the euro area, given its greater dependence on Russian energy, than in the United States or the United Kingdom.\\nPersistently higher energy prices and tighter financial conditions could shave up to a percentage point from previously anticipated 2022 growth for the euro area, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Meanwhile, inflation, as measured by headline consumer price indexes, could accelerate by 1 to 3 percentage points above what Vanguard had previously forecast.\\nInvestors need to appreciate the tremendous uncertainty confronting markets, said Shaan Raithatha, a London-based Vanguard senior economist, part of the team researching possible effects from a range of potential developments. He emphasized, \"The work we\\'re doing is based on conditions at present, and the situation is clearly fast-moving.\"\\nRising energy prices likely to weigh on growth and generate higher inflation\\nNotes: Prices are daily settlement prices for front-month Brent crude futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange in London and for front-month West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\\nSources: Vanguard illustration, using data from Bloomberg, as of March 2, 2022.\\n\\nPrices of benchmark oil futures trading in both London and New York are up more than 45% since the start of the year and more than 20% since a week before Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, reflecting both oil\\'s greater perceived risk and concerns about restrictions on supply.\\nHow long high energy prices persist and to what degree will be vital to informing whether our views move from our baseline case to a downside of even slower growth and higher inflation. For conditions to deteriorate to the point of ushering in a recession, oil prices would need to climb to a range of $130 to $150 a barrel for several quarters and financial conditions would need to tighten broadly, according to the Vanguard economics team\\'s analysis. Vanguard foresees developed-market inflation averaging more than 8% for all of 2022 in such a case.\\nGrowth and inflation effects would be felt more acutely in the euro area, which gets 40% of its natural gas and 25% of its oil from Russia,1 than in the United Kingdom or the United States, which use much less Russian energy.\\nCentral bank policy decisions hang in the balance\\nThe developments in Ukraine present central banks with a pertinent challenge: Do they continue down the path toward tighter monetary policy to fight even higher inflation, or do they pause and take stock given the new risks to growth? Vanguard currently doesn\\'t expect recent developments to materially affect U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England policy stances. The Fed\\'s chair told Congress on March 2 that a hike in the federal funds rate target at the Fed\\'s March 16 meeting remained appropriate, though he did acknowledge concern over events unfolding in Ukraine.\\nThe European Central Bank (ECB), meanwhile, meets sooner, on March 10. Vanguard hasn\\'t changed its expectation for a late-2022 ECB rate hike, though we\\'ll be watching developments closely. \"Our view is that recent events and the accompanying uncertainty have the potential to make the ECB more cautious,\" Raithatha said. \"This will skew the balance of risks toward the Governing Council delaying its normalization of monetary policy.

       "  'content': 'As investing uncertainty triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic continues beyond the 2-year mark, one constant has been the continued adoption of bond ETFs. Investors continue to pour money into bond ETFs—more than $210 billion in 2021 alone—accelerating a trend that began two decades ago.1 Over the five years ended December 31, 2020, bond ETF assets grew at an average annual rate of 25.0%, compared with the 7.3% growth rate for the outstanding value of the overall global bond market in the same period.2\\nWhat\\'s driving bond ETF growth?\\nThere\\'s evidence that many investors are becoming more inclined to use pooled products such as ETFs rather than hold a portfolio of individual bonds. When it comes to bond investing, ETFs hold several potential advantages over a ladder of individual bonds. Bond ETFs may offer greater control, diversification, and improved liquidity.\\nHere are two ways bond ETFs can help amplify your clients\\' portfolios, and a suggested plan for implementation. They can:\\n1. Allow for more precise control and diversification\\nInvesting in a single, near-term bond can be a sound practice provided it fits a defined near-term objective, and laddering a portfolio of, say, 10 to 25 bonds with sequentially longer maturities may seem to be a way to diversify a portfolio while retaining a hands-on approach. However, the laddering strategy can present challenges such as reinvestment risk and excessive sector concentration.\\nIn theory, any bond portfolio carries some level of reinvestment risk, which is the chance that when a bond matures, a bond with a similarly attractive yield may not be available for reinvestment. But this risk is magnified in a laddered bond strategy, where hefty chunks of the portfolio\\'s value must be periodically reinvested (with coupon payments sitting in cash). Because most ETFs track diversified and well-defined indexes, bond ETFs tend to have very stable risk-factor exposures and they can be bought and sold in slices as small as one share.\\nWith individual bonds there is a chance that the portfolio will skew toward high-quality and liquid U.S. Treasuries or municipals, because other types of bonds are more challenging to source. For instance, corporate, securitized, and non-U.S. bonds exhibit credit, prepayment, and liquidity risks that can be daunting for any investor. An allocation to bond ETFs provides more flexible exposure to these markets, making them a highly effective—and simple—way to diversify and enhance yield while maintaining a strong quality profile.\\nYour clients may gravitate toward individual bonds because a \"hold to maturity\" mindset allows them to ignore interim price movements. However, all bonds have dynamic market prices, and whether held in a ladder, a mutual fund, or an ETF, a client who needs to access liquidity prior to a given bond\\'s maturity is subject to the same price risk. Additionally, a typical bond ladder holds far fewer bonds than a diversified bond ETF. As a result, bond ladders carry more default risk—if one bond goes bad, it could meaningfully affect a client\\'s portfolio.\\n2. Reduce costs compared with building individual bond ladders\\nA laddered bond portfolio does not carry an explicit expense ratio. This may have made it more appealing a few years ago when bond mutual funds had an average expense ratio greater than 0.50%.3 Now bond ETF expense ratios are often measured in single basis points. The asset-weighted average expense ratio for bond ETFs was 0.16% as of December 31, 2020,4 and it was just 0.04% for Vanguard\\'s corporate bond ETFs and broad-market bond ETFs.5\\nTransacting in the bond market also has the implicit costs of bid-ask spreads to consider. Because ETFs trade as securities on an exchange and their bonds are sourced by institutional investors, they confer a transparent layer of liquidity that can dramatically reduce spreads, particularly for corporate or securitized bonds.\\nThe table below illustrates an example of quotes available from a range of dealers on February 17, 2021, for a specific large and liquid bond that happened to be a top holding in Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT).6\\n\\nThe spread between the best bid and ask prices that may be accessible to institutional investors—who can readily \"shop around\" among different dealers—was about $0.15.\\nFor investors who might be more limited in their access, and only able to access Dealer A, the bid-ask spread was a little more than $0.50.\\nVCIT traded at a spread of $0.01.7\\n\\nConsidering the spread and expense ratio, ETFs are a very cost-effective way to expand into sectors offering yield premiums and diversification.\\nDepth of a sample corporate bond quote\\n\\n\\n\\nDealer\\nBid ($)\\nAsk ($)\\nBid quantity(thousands)\\nAsk quantity(thousands)\\n\\n\\nA\\n116.118\\n116.646\\n100\\n100\\n\\n\\nB\\n116.314\\n—\\n500\\n—\\n\\n\\nC\\n115.238\\n117.504\\n200\\n600\\n\\n\\nD\\n116.258\\n116.468\\n100\\n100\\n\\n\\nE\\n115.072\\n—\\n100\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Bloomberg.\\nIntegrating bond ETFs into a portfolio of laddered bonds\\nA wholesale shift into a new investment vehicle can be a tall order, so a phased integration of bond ETFs may be an effective first step. Below are two frameworks for reinvesting a maturing bond from the portfolio rather than a sell-down across the portfolio.\\n\"Re-laddering\" option\\nIn a \"re-laddering\" framework, simply reinvest the matured capital in an ETF with a duration that approximates the maturity of the individual bond being purchased at the end of the ladder. In future years, the portfolio may be balanced with intermediate- and short-duration ETFs, transforming the portfolio gradually.\\n\"Liquidity sleeve\" option:\\nInvesting matured capital by choosing one or more ETFs that approximate the actual (or desired) characteristics of the portfolio in the aggregate is another option. The ETF position can be thought of as a “liquidity sleeve” that sits alongside the laddered bonds and grows over time. It could be tapped to source as-needed cash in a cost-effective way, without disrupting the characteristics of the portfolio.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nBond ETFs are an important part of the investing toolkit because many offer liquidity, low cost, and diversified and consistent exposure. Consider adding them as core components of any newly built portfolio or integrate them into existing portfolios—even those dedicated to individual bonds. \\n\\n\\n\\nCheck out our bond ETF lineup\\nLearn how our low-cost bond ETFs provide full coverage of the fixed income universe.Explore Vanguard Bond ETFs®'},\n",

       "  'content': 'As digital \"robo-advice\" offerings have expanded in scope and availability, questions have arisen about the future of traditional advice given by humans. Will digital advice take over?\\nOur research finds that human-advised clients are, in fact, not likely to switch to digital advisors. Quite the opposite, 9 in 10 robo-advised clients are considering switching to a human advisor in the future.\\xa0\\nAt the same time, clients believe that there is some room for automation of services in a practice.\\nFor human advisors, then, perhaps the most useful strategy is to figure out how to incorporate both modes of advice into their practice. We asked 1,500 advised clients in the United States about loyalty and perceptions regarding both types of financial advice.\\xa0\\nAmong our findings:\\n\\nAdvice adds value across the board: Regardless of the method of delivery, investors believe advice provides substantially higher incremental portfolio value versus \"going it alone.\" The perceived value-add to annual performance was 5% for human advice and 3% for digital-only advice.\\nPreference for financial advisors is enduring:\\xa0While more than 90% of human-advised clients say they would not consider switching to a digital service, 88% of robo-advised clients would consider switching to a human advisor in the future. However, time, willingness, and ability to manage investments seem to play a critical role in determining the choice of advice delivery.\\nClients prefer emotional support from human advisors: Investors using human advisors estimate being $160,000 closer to achieving their financial goals. Three times as many investors report having strong peace of mind when working with a human advisor as compared to going it alone.\\nDigital also serves a role for clients: Our findings also uncovered specific areas where investors prefer digital advice, such as for certain portfolio-management services (e.g., diversification and tax optimization).\\nPreference for advice service delivery is not dictated by client age or wealth: Contrary to popular belief, we do not find that millennials have distinct preferences from other generations regarding the automation of service within advice. Across all generations, wealth levels, and advice-delivery types, clients suggest that human advisors should consider automating some portfolio management services. Advisors should leverage technology to scale their business while strengthening their uniquely human value.\\n\\nQuantifying how investors value advice\\nClearly, investors want financial advice and find it valuable. Our survey asked investors to estimate their annual portfolio returns achieved with whichever mode of financial advice they used. It then asked them to estimate what they thought their returns would be over a three-year period without the assistance of their advice service.\\xa0\\nIndividuals working with human advisors estimated that on an annualized basis, they achieved a 15% average return with the help of their advisor, and estimated they would have seen only a 10% return if they had been unadvised—making a perceived value-add to annual performance of 5%.\\nThose with digital-only advice reported perceived average portfolio returns of 24% using their digital advice service. They estimated their return would drop to 21% if they did not use a digital advisor—making a perceived value-add to annual performance of 3%.\\xa0\\nInvestors believe human and digital advisors provide substantial portfolio value\\nNotes: Respondents were asked, \"In your experience with your human (or digital) advisor, what would you estimate your average annual investment returns to be in the past three years? If you have not had an advisor for three years, think about the relationship you have had with your advisor thus far.\"Respondents were also prompted to estimate their average annual investment return while working with their human (or digital) advisor. They were then told to imagine they did not have their advisor and instead managed their investments on their own. Given those circumstances, they were asked, “What would you imagine your average annual investment returns to be in the same period?”\\nSources: Vanguard and Escalent, 2021.\\n\\nHuman advisors still hold an edge\\nWhile the advice landscape is indeed evolving with the breadth and depth of digital offerings becoming available, our research indicates investors maintain significant loyalty to human advisors.\\nSurvey participants were asked, \"If you had to leave your current [human] advisor today, what type of advising relationship would you search for in the future?\"\\nFor investors that already use a human advisor, 93% said they would choose an advice service that includes a human advisor in the future. Despite the common headlines about technology replacing humans, our data suggests that investors have strong loyalty to keeping a human financial advisor.\\nInvestors with a human advisor not likely to switch to robo-only\\nNote: The sample in this figure includes all responding investors who only have human advisors (1,175 in total).\\nSources: Vanguard and Escalent, 2021.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nConversely, such loyalty did not exist when it came to digital-advised investors presented with the potential opportunity to hire a human replacement. When we asked current robo-advised clients about their future preference for advice delivery, 88% of those clients said they would be willing or extremely willing to work with a human advisor in the future.\\xa0\\nWe believe this has strong business-development implications for human advisors: Robo-advised clients could represent an untapped and under-targeted market to convert for human advisors, especially as those investors’ needs become more complex.\\nDigital-advised investors are willing to switch to human advice\\nRespondents were asked, \"on a scale of one to seven, how willing would you be to work with a human financial advisor in the future?\"\\nNote: The sample in this figure includes all responding investors who only have digital advisors (135 in total).\\nSources: Vanguard and Escalent, 2021.\\n\\nKnow what type of value you provide\\nInvestors did tend to favor one mode of advice—human or digital—for different types of advice tasks and services. For instance, investors said they preferred a human advisor when it came to:\\n\\nKnowing clients—feeling that they and their retirement goals are understood.\\nDeveloping a connection and relationship with clients.\\nWorking in clients\\' best interests—taking good care of them.\\nMaking clients feel listened to and understood.\\nDemonstrating empathy for clients\\' personal situations and needs.\\n\\nWhen it came to activities with a strong emphasis on portfolio construction and more functional tasks, investors preferred the service delivery be digital and automated:\\n\\nManaging taxes and capital gains efficiently.\\nGathering accurate inputs for clients by helping them understand how to answer.\\nAccounting for scenarios of different market conditions or life events (what-ifs).\\nPreventing details, or entire accounts, from being overlooked.\\nDiversifying investments.\\nSimplifying for organized, cohesive management.\\n\\nImplications for your practice\\nHuman advisors can take away a number of action items from this research in order to remain competitive in the evolving advice landscape.\\n\\nForemost, be sure to highlight your emotional value. As our research affirmed, this is the top benefit investors attach to a human advisor. Do you convey effectively that you will partner with clients long-term to reach their financial and life goals? If not, perhaps your marketing or other aspects of your business are in line for a review. Upskilling for you or your team on “soft skills” might also be appropriate.\\nYou can also thoughtfully review your client-acquisition and onboarding, with an eye toward attracting digital-only investors who are willing to switch to a human advisor. Digital advice users expect a friction-free experience. Make it easy for potential clients to find you, learn about your offer, and sign up with you.\\nReferring back to our list on investor preferences—how are you and your team aligned with them? If you haven’t already done so recently, now would be a good time to inventory all of the services and activities you perform on behalf of clients.\\nAlign your resources to most appropriately fit the business tasks where investors perceive they provide the greatest value. In other words, are people aligned to the emotional and financial outcome value tasks? Is technology assigned to the portfolio tasks that can be automated? If not, a good action step might be to investigate tools that can make you more efficient.'},\n",

This event featured Vanguard ESG experts Sarah Hersh, head of ESG Product Management, and Doug Grim, a senior investment strategist focused on portfolio research.\\nHere are four takeaways from their discussion:\\nWe approach ESG from an engage, allocate, and avoid framework.\\nVanguard does this in three ways: through engaging with the portfolio companies in our internally managed equity funds, through allocating capital to portfolio companies in our active funds, and through developing products that allow investors to mitigate exposure to certain ESG risks.\\nThen, the final category we call avoid. We offer ESG products that enable investors to avoid exposure to certain risks or issues that violate their preferences. We currently offer four exclusionary index ESG products across equity and fixed income. These include our ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV), ESG International Stock ETF (VSGX), ESG U.S. Corporate Bond ETF (VCEB), and FTSE Social Index Fund Admiral™ Shares(VFTAX).\\nRead more about our approach to ESG investing.\\n\\xa0\\nBeware of the performance-price myth when implementing ESG products.\\nIt\\'s a commonly held misconception that there is a trade-off between ESG considerations and investment returns. In reality, ESG strategies can be incorporated into diversified portfolios without compromising their risk and return characteristics.\\nOur research observations are truly all over the place. Historically, we identified ESG products that showed less risk, products that showed more risk, products with higher returns, and products with lower returns. We found no consistent risk and return characteristics of these products versus the broad market.\\nLearn more about our research findings by reading, Is there a performance price for ESG investing?Contrary to conventional wisdom, U.S. ESG equity funds are cost-competitive\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you look at it on an equally weighted basis, whether from the index side or the active side, ESG specific funds are not necessarily more expensive than conventional index or active funds. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t individual funds that may be more expensive or possibly cheaper. Our research has found that, on average, we don’t necessarily see all ESG funds as being more expensive.\"\\n\\n\\n—Doug Grim\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage annual expense ratios\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, based on data from Morningstar, Inc., as of December 31, 2020.\\nNotes: Our sample includes all open-ended equity mutual funds and ETFs with a U.S. investment focus that were available for sale in the U.S., as of December 31, 2020, including all share classes of each fund. We removed funds with an industry investment focus. From this sample, we separated ESG-focused funds from other funds using Morningstar\\'s \"Sustainable Investment Strategies\" classification.\\n\\nESG is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all approach.\\nWe believe that you should follow a four-step process when it comes to prudent ESG decision-making. You need to determine your goals, or define; understand your options, or evaluate; decide on and document an approach that best fits the unique ESG concerns and investment needs of your client; and, finally, make sure to continually assess and maintain this strategy.\\nOnce you know what your client is looking for, how do you help them evaluate the different ESG options available, while also keeping their goals in mind?'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Editor\\'s note: This research is the product of a team of Vanguard corporate credit analysts affiliated with Vanguard\\'s active taxable bond funds. The team\\'s insights are included in portfolio managers\\' bond selection in Vanguard\\'s actively managed taxable bond funds. \\nShortages of semiconductor chips are contributing to severe global supply-chain disruptions and higher consumer prices for everything from cars to toothbrushes. Those disruptions are unlikely to ease in the near term.\\nThe pandemic has accelerated some secular trends, including remote work and cloud computing, that are likely to translate into permanent increases in chip demand. However, COVID-related pent-up spending and overordering by manufacturers to avoid production shutdowns should normalize.\\nFrom a credit perspective, we are cautious on semiconductor companies. \"Bond valuations have become extremely tight, driven by excellent operational performance metrics and plentiful free cash flow,\" said Vanguard Senior Credit Analyst Scott Miles. \"Looking ahead, though, chip supply is likely to eventually overshoot demand growth—the semiconductor industry is prone to boom and bust cycles. We see more value among their customers, industrial OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), many of which have proven adept at navigating both the chip shortages and inflationary pressures.\"\\nHow we got here\\nDemand for chips initially fell sharply at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Government-mandated lockdowns and dire predictions of a prolonged recession led to sharp cuts in industrial manufacturing and a buildup in chip inventories. Auto production in the United States, for example, fell by 23% in the second quarter of 2020 even though chip sales to that end market only declined by 6%.\\nThen the economy began to recover far more quickly than anticipated, and a surge in demand followed. Chip manufacturers struggled to respond accordingly due to both the length of the manufacturing process and the inelasticity of supply.\\nIn addition, U.S. chip customers have felt the effect of global shipping logjams since the start of the pandemic. Chips are usually shipped by air, so the loss of belly space in commercial flights due to drastic cuts to plane travel reduced air freight capacity by as much as 75% in April 2020.\\nLooking ahead, demand will be key\\n\"We\\'re expecting a permanent increase in chip demand from PCs and other semiconductor end markets like networking equipment for remote work and learning,\" said Mr. Miles. \"Cloud computing apps and associated data center equipment should remain growth vectors as well. On the other hand, demand related to pent-up spending on consumer electronics is likely to prove more transitory.\"\\nAn even more worrisome development will be the winding down of widespread overordering and inventory hoarding on the part of distributors and OEMs—behavior that has aggravated chip shortages. The AlphaWise survey of chip distributors showed that inventory-building was prevalent throughout 2021, and even the latest reading shows that more than half of their customers are continuing to amass inventory. The survey results, shown in the figure below, fit with reports of double- or even triple-ordering on the part of OEMs. Such widespread overordering is a trend that is unlikely to end well for chip manufacturers.\\nAn end to inventory hoarding by OEMs could lead to a sharp downturn in demand\\nNote: Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding.\\nSources: AlphaWise and Morgan Stanley Research.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOur credit outlook for semiconductor manufacturers and industrial OEMs\\nCurrent credit valuations of semiconductor chip manufacturers\\' securities reflect supportive market trends. The future is unlikely to be as bright as 2021, however.\\nAs chip shortages persist into 2022, they will continue to add to global inflationary pressures. Double-ordering and inventory hoarding are likely to contribute to significant oversupply when the cycle turns. So, too, will recent substantial capacity expansion efforts.\\nWe see more value downstream in the securities of industrial OEMs, many of which have managed to successfully navigate supply shortages and rising input costs, including for labor. Moreover, supply constraints have enabled OEMs to raise prices to protect their margins, adjust their product mix to focus on their most profitable offerings, and improve their cash flow.\\n\"Auto manufacturers and many other industrial OEMs are also in the midst of a cyclical upturn thanks to strong demand coming out of the pandemic,\" said Vanguard Credit Analyst Andreas Nagstrup, \"And we would expect production volumes to accelerate as the semiconductor shortages eventually normalize.\"Vanguard active taxable bond funds with corporate credit exposure include the following.

That's why we set a goal in 2019 to return an additional $1 billion in value to shareholders by the end of 2025.\\nSince we set this ambitious goal, Vanguard has already reduced expense ratios and lowered fees across our investment lineup. That includes more than 225 fee reductions across Vanguard's active and index mutual funds, ETFs, and trusts.\\nHow Vanguard investor savings stack up\\nExpense ratio reductions are just one tool Vanguard uses to return value to shareholders. We've also lowered investor costs through multiple other channels, including by broadening access to lower-cost share classes and expanding access to commission-free brokerage transactions.\\nThrough these channels, Vanguard has saved investors more than $450 million from 2019 through 2021, and we expect to reach $650 million in savings by the end of 2022.\\nIn short, Vanguard is well on its way to the $1 billion goal.\\nHow Vanguard is progressing toward $1 billion in shareholder cost savings\\nNote: Chart shows returned shareholder value realized and projected since 2019.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhy costs matter so much\\nIn the end, aggressive cost savings can increase an investor's overall chance of success.

FTSE Russell is the benchmark provider for our two equity ESG ETFs and our FTSE Social Index Fund.\\nIn Part 1 of this two-part blog post, we highlighted the findings from our recently published research paper, focusing on the performance statistics of an index-based solution employing a rigorous, rules-based ESG-centric screening and exclusion process. Here we show the impact of that process in more detail, again using the FTSE US All Cap Choice Index to illustrate.\\nAs this case study shows, the results are intuitive in that the screening can have a significant impact on specific industries or sectors directly related to the screened products and activities. However, the overall composition of the index is not greatly affected.\\nWhile the screening process varies across the Global Choice series, the FTSE US All Cap Choice Index excludes stocks using the entire suite of product- and conduct-related screens. These range from such vice products as gambling and tobacco, to weapons manufacturing to governance issues such as a company's diversity and anti-corruption policies and procedures, as detailed in our research paper.\\nRead more about the construction of our ESG Indexes in our Ground Rules for Global Choice Index Series.\\nAs shown in the charts below, while the number of stocks in the US Choice Index fell across industries (gray bars) compared to that in the benchmark (teal bars), industry weights were fairly similar between the two.\\nNumber of stocks—FTSE USA All Cap benchmark versus FTSE US All Cap Choice Index\\nSource:\\xa0FTSE Russell.

For example, Energy went from 63 stocks to eight stocks and ended up with a weight close to zero. Of course, other industry weights will tend to rise: In this example, the US Choice exposures to Technology, Consumer Discretionary and Health Care stocks increased modestly versus those of the benchmark.\\nA look at the more granular sector classification level shows that the Oil, Gas, and Coal sector was completely eliminated, while the Alternative Energy sector dropped by only one stock.

As such, we continue to see full-year 2022 growth around 4%.\\nGrowth appears to have stabilized in the fourth quarter; we continue to see fourth-quarter growth around 5.5%.\\n\\nEuro area\\nCOVID-19-related restrictions on activity continue in many countries in the euro area, although the toughest of them, in the Netherlands, are being scaled back.\\n\\nThe recent surge in daily virus cases to more than 2,000 per million is likely to continue to weigh on growth in the first quarter of 2022.\\nThis development is part of Vanguard\\'s base case and, as such, we maintain our full-year 2022 forecast for growth around 4%.\\n\\nChina\\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) for all of 2021 increased by 8.1%, according to preliminary National Bureau of Statistics estimates. For all of 2022, we anticipate GDP growth around 5%, a level that would likely be below an official growth target that we expect will be set in a range of 5% to 6%.\\n\\nHeadwinds include a \"zero-COVID\" policy that continues to result in broad lockdowns ahead of the forthcoming Lunar New Year and Beijing Winter Olympics.\\nGiven these headwinds, we expect below-consensus growth around 3.5% in the first quarter of 2022, followed by above-consensus growth around 5% in the second quarter on the strength of anticipated policy stimulus and tweaks to zero-COVID.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nCOVID-19 and developed-market central banks may influence how economies in emerging markets perform in 2022.\\n\\nCountries with a combination of high vaccine-acquired and infection-acquired immunity to COVID-19, largely in Latin America but also in emerging Europe, will be supported simply by being able to keep their economies open.\\nCountries primarily in emerging Asia with less immunity could be hampered by continued virus vulnerability.\\nWe foresee emerging-market growth around 5.5% in 2022, with diminished global liquidity a potential downside risk.\\n\\nInflation will remain elevated through the first half of 2022\\nThe Consumer Price Index in the United States rose by 7% in December compared with December 2020, the largest 12-month increase since June 1982. The gauge rose by 0.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis in December compared with November, less than November\\'s 0.8% rise.\\n\\nVanguard estimates that the effects from supply constraints will persist into 2022 before inflation normalizes gradually toward the pre-pandemic trend.\\nWe foresee inflation remaining elevated before slowing in the second half of 2022, bringing the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) for year-end 2022 in the range of 2.3%–2.6% year-over-year.\\n\\nA revised outlook for when the FED will hike rates\\nAmid heightened inflation, falling unemployment, and increasing wage pressures, we believe the Fed will begin a rate-hike cycle in the first half of 2022, and perhaps as early as its March meeting depending on wage and inflation data in the interim.\\n\\nWe anticipate at least two quarter-point hikes in 2022 to the Fed’s target range for its federal funds rate, with additional policy-tightening likely warranted, whether through balance sheet reduction or one or two additional policy rate hikes.\\nVanguard believes that the Federal Reserve may need to raise its target for short-term interest rates to 3% from its current range of 0%–0.25%. That would require steady rate hikes over the next few years, to a degree that markets haven’t priced in beyond 2022.\\nThe delicate position for the Fed is to tighten policy enough to moderate inflation pressures without doing so too aggressively and ending the business cycle prematurely, according to a new Q&A with Vanguard economists Josh Hirt, Asawari Sathe, and Adam Schickling.\\nBond investors should welcome the prospect of higher interest rates. Although rising rates may produce modest negative returns for a time, they’re a long-term positive.\\nIn a recent commentary, Vanguard Global Chief Economist Joe Davis noted that, “In my view, markets are underestimating the degree to which central banks will need to use their powerful tools to pull inflation back to acceptable levels.”\\n\\nLabor demand begins to push wages up\\nA second straight below-consensus headline job-creation figure in the United States once again underestimated the labor market\\'s strength. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 199,000 jobs were created in December and the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%.\\n\\nVanguard anticipates further labor market tightening with continued upward wage pressure amid strong demand for workers.\\nWe expect the unemployment rate to fall below its pre-pandemic level toward the end of summer in 2022.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInflation won’t come down magically\\nOur global chief economist explains why central banks will need to act decisively to rein in accelerating inflation.View article\\n\\n\\n\\nThe thinking behind the Fed\\'s coming rate-hike cycle\\nWith inflation at multidecade highs, see why the Federal Reserve appears prepared to raise its key interest rate target.View article'},\n",

       "  'content': \"At Vanguard, we've always emphasized the importance of investing for the long term. The example of two recent U.S. equity market trading days helps reinforce that message.\\nOn January 20, the markets rose solidly throughout the day, with the Nasdaq, best-known for technology stocks, up nearly 2% at its highest point. But the gains evaporated in a flurry of late selling. Just two business days later, on January 24, the situation presented itself in reverse. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of the largest U.S. companies was down by as much as 4% yet finished in positive territory after a late-day surge.\\nAnyone who hadn't paid attention to the wild swings may have thought that stocks' daily movements were unremarkable. We've always believed that, for long-term investors, not paying attention to the day-to-day is a wise strategy.\\nSeveral factors suggest more volatility ahead\\nIt hasn't been possible, of course, to avoid the developments that have so roiled the financial markets in 2022. Two of the biggest—accelerating inflation and a pandemic that just won't quit—we're living with every day. Throw in a Federal Reserve that we believe will need to act decisively to contain inflation, as Vanguard's global chief economist, Joe Davis, recently wrote, and it's not hard to imagine more volatility ahead, along with the potential for losses in a stock markets that low interest rates have fueled.\\nBut it remains possible to maintain perspective through understanding history. Volatility, as the illustration shows, is a constant that tends to spike when stock markets endure valleys.\\nA history of volatility and long-term gains\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, using data from Refinitiv Datastream through January 21, 2022. Data accessed on January 24, 2022.\\nNotes: Intraday volatility is calculated as the daily range of trading prices ([high-low]/opening price) for the S&P 500 Index. Periods of extended volatility above historical averages have at times resulted in sharp losses during the period, as shown. The index value has also risen during periods of extended high volatility.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhat investors should keep sight of is that, over time, these inevitable valleys have given way to higher peaks. It's why we continue to invest to finance our long-term goals, such as retirement. And it should be our goals that govern our approach to investing. These goals, as Vanguard's principles for investing success emphasizes, should be built on realistic assumptions for investing returns.\\nA time to embrace balance and discipline\\nThe Vanguard Economic and Market Outlook for 2022 notes our guarded, though not bearish, long-term equity return outlooks. The course of the year ahead will be influenced by how policymakers remove from still-growing economies the strong fiscal and monetary support that had been required to withstand the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nOur outlook for fixed income is more sanguine; although interest rates remain historically low, modest rises since 2020 have moved our return outlooks commensurately higher.\\xa0\\nPolicymakers face a balancing act in the months ahead, one that could carry significant implications for economic growth, inflation, and investment returns. Their jobs won't be easy. Investors, meanwhile, may find their discipline challenged by markets that have approached or already entered corrections, or falls of 10% or more from recent highs.\\nOur message for investors, as always: Maintain perspective, tune out the day-to-day noise that can lead to impulsive decisions, be true to your goals, and put your faith in a history that has rewarded those who embrace the long term.\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.\\nInvestments in bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'With inflation at multidecade highs, the Federal Reserve appears prepared to raise its key interest rate target, perhaps as early as March. In this Q&A, Vanguard economists Josh Hirt, Asawari Sathe, and Adam Schickling discuss inflation, labor, and the risks of the Fed’s hiking rates either too aggressively or not aggressively enough.\\nIn a related commentary, Vanguard global chief economist Joe Davis discusses why central banks need to use their powerful tools to rein in inflation and why, long-term, that can be good for investors.\\nWhat challenges does the Fed face in deciding when to raise rates and by how much?\\nJosh: The Fed\\'s mandate from Congress is to ensure price stability and maximum sustainable employment. The broadest U.S. inflation measure is higher than it\\'s been in nearly 40 years, and the unemployment rate is falling fast toward a pre-pandemic level that was itself at a 50-year low.\\nThe Fed\\'s biggest challenge is the lack of clarity in key areas of the economy. Beyond the immediate impact on activity, the effects of the COVID-19 Omicron variant on the labor market and inflation are unknown. Omicron also has the potential to exacerbate global supply-chain issues. The Fed ideally would want a clearer read into the underlying strength of the economy as fiscal support wanes before deciding to tighten conditions.\\nWhat is Vanguard\\'s view on when the Fed will raise rates and by how much?\\nJosh: We\\'ve just revised our view on when the Fed will likely need to raise rates, from the second half of 2022 to the first half, perhaps as early as March. Wage inflation data will be important to that timing. We believe the Fed will initiate at least two quarter-point rate hikes in 2022, and that additional policy tightening will likely be warranted, either through a reduction in the Fed\\'s bond holdings or through one or two more policy rate increases.\\nHow will inflation expectations likely play into the Fed’s interest rate decisions?\\nAsawari: Inflation expectations shouldn\\'t change much in response to the latest data. If they do and continue to push higher, they\\'ll have become unanchored, which would allow wages and prices to begin to spiral out of control. We haven\\'t reached that point, but even before more recent concerns materialized about wage inflation—which tends to indicate more persistent inflation—we saw shorter-term and then some longer-term inflation expectations rising. We\\'re far away from saying inflation expectations have become unanchored, but the Fed won’t want to risk that and is likely prepared to act to fend it off.\\nWhat is the Fed looking for regarding the other portion of its mandate—\"maximum sustainable employment,\" also called \"full employment\"?\\nAdam: The Fed will want to see in the January employment data what the Omicron wave has meant for the labor market. But the traditional definition of full employment, in its rawest sense, is that everyone who wants a job has one or can easily get one. By almost every labor market metric, we\\'re very close. There are still a couple of million unemployed people who say they want a job, and that cohort is about 600,000 larger than it was pre-COVID. That includes some who can be very selective in the job and wages they accept. We expect that cohort to contract quickly.\\nGiven these insights, what does the Fed need to consider about the pace and duration of the forthcoming hiking cycle?\\nJosh: Our view is that, over the next few years, the Fed will ultimately need to raise rates to a level that restricts the economy sufficiently to contain inflation—by our estimates likely around 3%. That is roughly 100 basis points higher than where the market has been pricing.1\\nOur view considers our estimate of the neutral rate and inflation around the Fed\\'s target level.2\\nThe delicate position for the Fed is to tighten policy enough to moderate inflation pressures without doing so too aggressively and ending the business cycle prematurely. But being too easy at this point likely invites a greater risk. If the Fed were to lose control of inflation or inflation expectations, there\\'s a range of potential outcomes that could have negative effects on the real economy, the value of assets, and people\\'s standards of living. We expect these considerations to be part of Fed policy debates.\\n\\xa0\\n1 A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\\n2 The neutral rate is the rate at which policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive.\\n\\n\\n\\nWebcast replay: 2022 economic outlook and portfolio opportunities Recorded January 12 at 1 p.m., Eastern time\\nHear fresh perspectives on key economic issues and market forces, plus practical suggestions for using those insights to make portfolio-construction decisions for your clients.Watch the replay\\n\\n\\n\\nVanguard economic and market outlook: 2022\\nGet Vanguard\\'s perspectives on key economic issues and market forces, as well as practical suggestions for how you can apply those perspectives to the portfolio-construction and product choices you make for your clients.Read the outlook'},\n",

       "  'content': 'To appreciate the strength of economic recovery from the sharp 2020 COVID-19 recession, look no further than the labor markets. Unemployment rates around the world have fallen toward pre-pandemic lows. In most developed markets, pretty much anyone who wants a job can find one.\\nFewer workers are participating in the labor force than before the pandemic, and the higher wages they can secure as employers compete for them threaten to take already accelerating inflation to a new, more worrisome level. Wage inflation is \"sticky.\" Although it takes time for wages to climb in tandem with broader prices, when they do, they\\'re fully along for the ride and ready to jump into the driver\\'s seat.\\nCentral banks have underestimated this strength in labor markets and the growing wage pressures. In my view, markets are underestimating the degree to which central banks will need to use their powerful tools to pull inflation back to acceptable levels.\\nHigher rates are in the U.S. economy\\'s best interest, a point I emphasized in a previous commentary. Vanguard believes that the Federal Reserve may need to raise its target for short-term interest rates to 3% from its current range of 0%–0.25%. That would require steady rate hikes over the next few years, to a degree that markets haven\\'t priced in beyond 2022.\\nIn a Q&A, Vanguard economists Josh Hirt, Asawari Sathe, and Adam Schickling discuss labor, inflation, our 3% figure, and the potential risks of the Fed moving too aggressively or not aggressively enough.\\nWhy higher rates can be a good thing\\nBond investors should welcome the prospect of higher interest rates. Although rising rates may produce modest negative returns for a time, they\\'re a long-term positive. We recently wrote about the silver lining in rising rates—how investors with a longer horizon than their portfolio\\'s duration stand to benefit.1 Raising short-term rates should also forestall a rise in long-term bond yields because expectations of future inflation should not rise further.\\nEquity investors may feel less hopeful, and that\\'s understandable. In recent years they\\'ve come to enjoy some heady returns, fueled by negative after-inflation interest rates. The removal of such stimulus as central banks address inflation suggests turbulence ahead.\\nBut negative real interest rates and the higher equity valuations they\\'ve promoted have come at a cost of future returns. That\\'s why our long-term outlook for equities, as we discuss in the Vanguard economic and market outlook for 2022, is so guarded.\\nThe theme of our annual economic outlook, \"Striking a better balance,\" acknowledges the challenges that policymakers face in removing monetary and fiscal support that propped up economies during an unprecedented crisis. Surging inflation won’t come down magically. The path for central banks is clear.\\nAccelerating inflation is a threat to economies that otherwise remain fundamentally sound.

       "  'content': \"ETFs are enjoying explosive growth (Figure 1) because they offer potential advantages that include flexibility, diversification, lower costs, and potential tax benefits. These advantages have continued to provide advisors and their clients with an excellent chance of achieving investment success. To understand why the ETF market is so efficient and so resilient at a time of record inflows, exploding assets, and market volatility, it's necessary to explore a process that includes a number of market participants working together to meet investor demand.\\nThis elaborate process involving investors, issuers, exchanges, and market makers helps produce more favorable outcomes for ETF investors by increasing liquidity and lowering costs through tighter bid-ask spreads. As ETFs continue to evolve, investors and advisors can benefit from a closer look to help them understand how these key players shape the ETF landscape and help drive efficiencies.\\nFigure 1. ETF trading volume has exploded over the last 20 years\\nSources: Bloomberg, Morningstar, and Vanguard, 2022.\\n\\nThe ETF ecosystem explained\\nETFs offer multiple layers of liquidity that benefit investors and markets. One layer is the secondary market, or the trading of ETF shares between two market participants on ETF exchanges or other trading venues. An additional layer of liquidity comes from the primary market, where ETF shares are created or redeemed in exchange for the underlying basket of securities. The primary market is what helps keep ETF prices in line with their fair value and directly influences the ETF liquidity profile that clients experience when trading ETFs in the secondary market.\\nTo facilitate these layers of liquidity, there are a number of participants in the ETF ecosystem, including investors, issuers, exchanges, and market makers (Figure 2).\\nFigure 2. A deeper look at the key ETF participants\\nSource: Vanguard, 2022.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nInvestors place orders to buy and sell ETFs on exchanges and often interact with the other key players. Demand from investors helps shape the ETF products that come to market.\\nETF issuers are asset management firms such as Vanguard that develop, register, and distribute ETFs. Issuer responsibilities include:\\n\\nStructuring the ETF product. This includes selecting the benchmark, setting fees, and determining the investment approach for each ETF. The way the product is structured will directly affect the transaction costs that investors pay when trading the ETF in the secondary market.\\nControlling ETF creation and redemption activity. Issuers are responsible for the process that allows new ETF shares to both enter and be removed from the market. This creation/redemption process is referred to as the primary market; it allows ETFs to trade efficiently and ensures significant liquidity for ETF investors trading in the secondary market.\\n\\nThere are three ETF exchanges in the United States: NYSE Arca, CBOE, and Nasdaq. In addition to providing a listing venue for ETF products, these exchanges create orderly markets by ensuring that investor limit orders (which investors use to specify a trade price) are held to the national best-bid and best-offer price. Exchanges also incentivize market makers to provide liquidity in listed ETF products, which helps ensure that there will be someone on the other side of an investor's order to buy or sell an ETF.\\nETF market makers consist of firms that provide two-sided (buy and sell) quotes in ETFs and execute investor transactions. By constantly posting orders to buy and sell ETF shares to meet investor demand, they are the primary providers of liquidity for ETFs.\\nAuthorized participants (APs) are a type of market maker. They are financial institutions that have contracts in place with ETF issuers that enable them to create and redeem ETF shares. There is often a misconception that investors need to transact with an AP when placing large block ETF orders, because, they believe, the AP is better positioned to trade the ETF. This may not always be the case and in many instances, a market maker that is not an AP is better suited to trade a large ETF block. It's important to consult with the issuer's capital markets desk to understand which market makers may be better suited for large ETF trades. This decision often depends on the product type and asset class.\\nIf demand is heavy for a particular ETF, the price of that ETF may increase slightly above its fair value. In such cases, market makers will naturally be on the other side of the trade selling ETF shares to meet investor demand. If a market maker doesn't have enough shares in its inventory to meet client purchases, it will short or sell the ETF and look for ways to hedge risk, while contacting the ETF issuer to create new shares. This activity results in three positive developments:\\n\\nIt injects new ETF supply into the market, helping keep investor executions close to fair value;\\nIt allows market makers to minimize risk by covering their short positions.\\nIt provides market makers with an arbitrage opportunity to buy the underlying basket of securities slightly below the ETF price, which helps drive competition for ETF order flow and anchors the ETF price to the true value of the fund.\\n\\nThe four key players of the ETF ecosystem create an interdependent framework that shapes the ETF trading experience and makes the ETF market much more liquid and efficient. Investor demand helps shape the ETF products that come to market. Issuers structure ETF products, which directly affects investor transaction costs. Market makers post quotes on exchanges to satisfy ETF investor demand and work with ETF issuers to create and redeem shares to offset their risk, driven by investor trading. The dynamic between market makers and issuers helps keep the ETF price in line with fair value through the creation and redemption process. Exchanges create an orderly market for investors to interact with market makers.\\nThe result of this intricate process is lower costs, enhanced liquidity, and greater trading efficiencies—all of which benefit investors.Notes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs,\\xa0obtain a prospectus\\xa0(or summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-997-2798 to request one.

Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

These findings offer investors the confidence that these indexes can serve as close substitutes for their underlying benchmarks while allowing them to express their ESG values in portfolios.\\nFor illustrative purposes, we present the performance statistics for the FTSE US All Cap Choice Index, which uses the FTSE USA All Cap benchmark as a starting universe, for the six-year period ended March 31, 2021. As shown, US Choice outperformed the underlying benchmark\\'s annualized gain of roughly 13.7% by 1.40 percentage points, with comparable volatility. The tracking error over this period was 1.26%.Performance statistics—April 2015 to March 2021\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nUSA All Cap\\nUS All Cap Choice\\n\\n\\nAverage return (annualized)\\n13.68%\\n15.07%\\n\\n\\nVolatility\\n15.40%\\n15.35%\\n\\n\\nReturn/Vol ratio\\n0.89\\n0.98\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nExcess return\\n\\xa0\\n1.40%\\n\\n\\nTracking error\\n\\xa0\\n1.26%\\n\\n\\nInformation ratio\\n\\xa0\\n1.11\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: FTSE Russell.

During the long climb upward of bull markets, portfolios can easily skew out of balance as outperforming holdings make up an increasingly larger portion of a client\\'s assets and create larger potential tax liabilities. Plans may require adjusting in light of new information.\\nA down market affords clients a chance to redeploy their capital in ways that, potentially, could more efficiently advance them toward achieving their financial goals.\\nThe starting point for your conversation with each client will vary. You can prioritize your area of focus by applying a \"three As\" (assess, address, audit) framework to the client\\'s situation. But, generally speaking, your cleaning up of client portfolios and plans should include reviews of their:\\n\\nAsset allocation and related issues.\\nTax efficiency via asset location and other means.\\nRetirement strategies.\\n\\nAsset allocation\\nAssessing this dimension includes rebalancing—an activity that under ordinary market conditions might seem routine. Amid a downturn, however, clients\\' questions or concerns about rebalancing may open the door to a broader conversation about their risk tolerance. Has their appetite for risk changed since you originally helped them build a portfolio and accompanying financial plan? Has volatility revealed a gap between clients\\' previously stated risk tolerance and their actual appetite for risk in the moment?\\nOther considerations include evaluating the portfolio for the merits of active versus passive holdings; opportunities to swap high-cost funds and ETFs with low-cost replacements; and the chance to dilute and diversify concentrated equity positions, when share prices (and, thus, the possibility of adverse tax implications) are lower.\\nTax efficiency\\nYou can examine the tax efficiency of a client’s account both at the fund level and at the account level.\\n\\nFund level: Are funds (or the holdings in them) tax-efficient? If any are not (for example, a fund with a high turnover rate), can they be replaced with something that is?\\nAccount level: This might be the time to consider rebalancing a client\\'s accounts in a way similar to rebalancing their assets. At the outset, you may have advised the client to hold a certain percentage of assets in tax-advantaged accounts and the remainder in taxable accounts. Over time, as certain investments and asset classes outperform others, that ratio will increasingly skew from the original policy asset location. Thus, an opportunity arises to shift assets to once again align with the agreed-upon policy.\\n\\nFor some clients, it could make sense to consider a Roth conversion. In converting a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA, an investor shifts the timing for the payment of taxes on their investments.\\nWith traditional retirement savings accounts, the investor makes tax-exempt contributions in the accumulation stage and pays taxes on distributions in retirement. Conversely, with a Roth, the investor makes contributions with after-tax dollars; the investor can take distributions tax-exempt, if certain time-of-ownership and age requirements are met.\\nWhen converting a traditional account (or a portion of it) to a Roth, taxes must be paid upfront on the amount being converted. During a downturn, when most asset prices are depressed, the tax bill will probably be lower than it would be were the assets trading at their \"normal\" valuations. Assuming those assets eventually rise in value again, performing a Roth conversion in a down market can provide a significant tax savings immediately. But it can also prove beneficial down the road, when the investor can potentially realize market gains and spend from the account tax-exempt, as well as enjoy other advantages.*\\nDetermining if a Roth conversion is appropriate involves weighing trade-offs and making assumptions about future taxation levels, among other calculations. As an advisor, you\\'re uniquely suited to help clients navigate such a complex choice.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Vanguard's Tax-Planning Series explores how advisors can deepen their client relationships as they help clients minimize the burden of taxes and more efficiently reach their financial goals.\\nIt's the end of the year, and many clients might be in the giving spirit when it comes to causes they support and believe in. That generosity probably stops, however, at giving the government more than is absolutely necessary in taxes.\\nA well-planned charitable giving strategy can help clients support their causes and reduce income and capital gains taxes. Given the resilient stock market and tax provisions enacted through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, many charitably inclined clients can be particularly well served by an effective giving strategy.\\nUnder the 2017 tax act, the standard deduction available to taxpayers increased substantially, while other deductions were eliminated or rendered moot. For example, the standard deduction available to a single person rose from $6,350 in 2017 to $12,550 in the 2021 tax year; and for a married couple filing jointly, it rose from $12,700 in 2017 to $25,100 in 2021. Other deductions less than those amounts were eliminated or rendered moot under the aforementioned act.\\nGiving ahead of schedule\\nOne work-around is for taxpayers to accelerate their charitable giving.\\nTaxpayers can roll several years' worth of contributions into one, in order to exceed the higher standard deductions brought into force by the tax act.\\nIt may seem like a lot at once, but at least a portion is then tax-deductible for that year, and the taxpayer is funding a charity.\\nTaxpayers also might consider engaging a donor-advised fund, a vehicle which gives taxpayers greater flexibility in how to meet their charitable giving goals.\\nThe challenge is that many charities depend on recurring gifts and factor them into their operating budgets. A donor-advised fund, such as one of the options offered by Vanguard Charitable, allows a donor to make a large, tax-deductible gift in one year, and then regulate its disbursement over ensuing years. Meanwhile, the dollars have the potential to grow tax-free in the account.\\nSay, for example, a client gave $50,000 to Vanguard Charitable in a donor-advised fund.\\nThen, in each of the next five years, they could indicate which charities were to receive an allotted $10,000 from the donor-advised fund. In the meantime, if the market were to go up, any invested money would grow as well. Hypothetically, the $50,000 fund investment could become $60,000 with market appreciation—and the growth would be tax-free.\\nPotential advantages of using a donor-advised fund\\nThe following example assumes that the persons involved are single and take the standard deduction for federal income taxes, except in the first year for the person who donated $50,000 to a donor-advised fund. The money in the donor-advised fund is projected to grow at 6% a year. Any taxes saved on capital gains realized by donating appreciated securities or property are in addition to any tax savings shown below.\\nSee how much gifts of different sizes will save you in taxes in the first year using Vanguard Charitable's Tax Savings Calculator.\\n* Each year.\\nNotes: The assumed 6% rate of return is not guaranteed. It is an illustrative example of a long-term average return on a balanced investment of stocks and bonds. Market returns are not constant and will fluctuate annually. Lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains may make the first scenario more favorable and the difference between the first- and second-scenario balances less. Any future changes in the tax treatment of investment earnings or a rate of return that is lower than the assumed rate of return may further affect the comparison. Investors should consider their time horizon and current and expected future tax rates before making an investment decision.\\nSource: Vanguard\\n\\nShowing appreciation … with appreciated securities\\nThere’s another potential benefit as well: a reduction in capital gains taxes. Tax-deductible gifts can include appreciated securities. Even complex assets such as hedge funds, LLCs, or even art or real estate can be donated.\\nBy donating an appreciated security or property in-kind, the donor receives full value for the tax deduction and pays no capital gains on the appreciation. Meanwhile, the charity, or donor-advised fund, can sell the security or property, and it pays no capital gains taxes.\\xa0\\nFor instance, a client could decide to give $50,000 in appreciated stock to a donor-advised fund. The donor-advised fund could then sell it tax-free, invest the proceeds in a diversified portfolio, and allow the portfolio to grow. The client could then give to charity a percentage or dollar amount every year. The fund can be used flexibly to meet the client's charitable needs and goals: Perhaps they want to use the fund for immediate needs, such as disaster relief; or maybe they want to use it to save for a longer-term purpose, such as creating a scholarship fund or funding a hospital wing.\\nThe advisor advantage\\nThere are other giving options that many eligible investors might not consider without being informed of them by an advisor. For instance, qualified charitable donations, or QCDs, allow individuals aged 70½ and older to give IRA funds to charity rather than taking them as IRS-mandated required minimum distributions. In so doing, up to $100,000 of the IRA funds are exempt from taxes annually. It’s worth noting that donor-advised funds, however, currently cannot accept QCDs.\\nHaving conversations on such matters can go a long way toward helping you better understand your clients. Asking why making charitable contributions matters to them is a uniquely human—and meaningful—gesture that builds trust and deepens your relationship.\\nOn a practical level, reviewing these types of giving options can increase clients' satisfaction with their charitable giving efforts, increase the amount they're able to give, and save them tax expenditures in the process.\\n\\xa0\\nFounded by Vanguard in 1997 as an independent 501(c)(3) organization, Vanguard Charitable strongly aligns with Vanguard's principled investment philosophy and believes in the importance of long-term, strategic charitable planning through a donor-advised fund. \\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal.\\nWe recommend that you consult a tax or financial advisor about your individual situation.\"},\n",

This has led to ESG becoming the topic of many of your client conversations.\\nAs investor appetite for ESG increases, clients may wonder how such a shift to ESG investments will impact their risk and return expectations. Have Investors Paid a Performance Price? Examining the Behavior of ESG Equity Funds (PDF), a research paper published by Vanguard Investment Strategy Group\\'s Jan-Carl Plagge and Doug Grim in The Journal of Portfolio Management examines whether ESG equity fund strategies come with a cost in the form of lower expected returns, higher volatility, or both.\\nESG fund performance varies\\nMr. Plagge and Mr. Grim looked at ESG mutual funds and ETFs focused on U.S.-listed stocks and investigated differences in their gross returns and volatility (standard deviation of returns) over a 15-year period compared with the FTSE USA All Cap Index. They distinguished between index and active funds and between funds that apply explicit exclusions and those that do not. Dividing the sample period into three five-year periods, they found a high level of dispersion for both risk and return among ESG strategies. (See chart below.)\\n\"We found funds with higher returns and higher risk, lower returns and lower risk, higher returns and lower risk, and lower returns and higher risk than their investment universe,\" Mr. Grim said. \"Overall, our findings suggest that ESG funds have neither systematically higher nor systematically lower raw returns or risk than the broader market.\"\\nESG funds produce mixed risk and return results versus the broad market\\nNotes: The data points reflect the annualized five-year standard deviation and gross return of each fund minus the broad U.S. equity market as proxied by the FTSE USA All Cap Index. ESG fund categories include index funds, active funds, exclusion based, and nonexclusion based.

To control for factor tilts, they evaluated the performance of ESG strategies against that of each of the factors in the Fama-French five factor model: market, size, valuation (value/growth), profitability (quality), and capital investment.\\nThe market factor proved, as one would expect, highly significant across the entire fund universe. The influence of style factors, on the other hand, was much less consistent. Some ESG funds had statistically significant and positive exposures to a given factor, while others had a significant but negative exposure to the same factor—and some had no noteworthy exposure to that factor at all.\\nMany of the funds performed quite differently compared with the market-capitalization-weighted U.S. equity market. \"However, after controlling for the impact of known sources of risk—that is, market- and style-factor exposures—the majority of ESG funds did not produce statistically significant positive or negative gross alpha,\" Mr. Plagge said. \"Return and risk differences of ESG funds can be significant, but they appear to be mainly driven by fund-specific criteria rather than a homogeneous ESG factor.\"\\nBecause ESG funds often favor new technologies and avoid certain sectors, such as those relating to fossil fuels, the researchers were interested in the effects of such systematic deviations in industry exposures. Funds in the sample tended to be slightly underweighted in finance, energy, minerals, and consumer services and slightly overweighted in health and technology. However, the authors found the effects of these deviations on relative fund performance to be very small in median terms when sampled on a quarterly basis across the 15-year period with all funds observed.\\nMr. Grim and Mr. Plagge then calculated net (after cost) alphas and analyzed their relationship to expense ratios. There was again a significant dispersion in the results (See chart below). Consistent with other research, higher expenses generally were associated with lower (or negative) net alphas.\\nHigher ESG fund management expenses tend to be associated with lower net alpha\\nNotes: Relationship between net alpha and average over monthly expense ratios. Mostly expense ratios are calculated as the difference between gross and net returns. The exhibit includes data from the five-year periods: 2004 to 2008, 2009 to 2013, and from 2014 to 2018.

Just as important, the year\\'s end presents a chance for clients to shore up possibly depleted accounts, plan for tax-advantaged contribution deadlines, and tend to health care tasks that have a significant financial component.\\nThis article provides a partial checklist of items to review with clients in assessing the year that\\'s concluding and preparing for the one that lies ahead.\\nOne way to start is by acknowledging to clients that things still might not feel like \"normal.\" The end of 2021 finds the world still emerging from a global health crisis and the United States bracing for potential changes in tax policy. These are factors you might consider in the course of your planning.\\nIf we revisit the three As (assess, address, audit) framework of financial advisor action, the most relevant step to year-end planning is the audit phase. In this step, you evaluate the results of actions taken during the year and discuss them with clients—demonstrating your value in the process.

It was a sobering reminder of the importance of having quickly accessible emergency savings. Depending on clients\\' circumstances, now could be a good time to talk to them about rebuilding savings they may have used during the pandemic or paying back early distributions from retirement accounts, as they were permitted under the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act (more on the act below).\\nHealth care planning\\nHealth Savings Account (HSA)\\nAre clients enrolled in an HSA as part of an eligible high-deductible health plan taking advantage of the potential triple tax benefit by investing their contributions? Are they properly prioritizing their contributions among their HSA and other investing accounts?\\nMedicare\\nAre clients near the eligibility age of 65 for receiving Medicare insurance benefits? If so, you should ask them about their plans for enrolling before their 65th birthday—lifelong premium penalties may apply if they sign up after turning 65.\\nIf clients already participate in Medicare, are their current coverage elections—including those for prescription drugs—still adequate and appropriate? (Each year, Medicare’s October 15–December 7 open enrollment period for current enrollees offers a chance to make changes.) Vanguard provides a \"prioritize, evaluate, choose\" to help you and your clients streamline the potentially confusing process of selecting a Medicare plan.\\n\\nPrioritizeAsk a client: What do you want out of your coverage? Consider the trade-offs between affordability, flexibility, cost certainty, and worst-case protection.\\nEvaluateClients should map the features they find most important to the strengths and weaknesses of different coverage types.\\nChooseResearch specific policies. Ensure that clients enroll on time to avoid penalties and coverage gaps.Charitable giving\\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the standard deduction available to taxpayers increased substantially. For the 2021 tax year, it is $12,550 (for persons filing individually) or $25,100 (for persons who are married and filing jointly). Other deductions less than those amounts were eliminated or rendered moot under the aforementioned act.\\nAccelerated giving\\nOne work-around is for taxpayers to accelerate their charitable giving—taxpayers can roll several years\\' worth of contributions into one, in order to exceed the higher standard deductions brought into force by the 2017 tax act.\\nFor instance, a donor-advised fund (DAF)—such as the options offered by Vanguard Charitable1—allows a donor to make a large, tax-deductible gift in one year and then regulate its disbursement over ensuing years. Meanwhile, the dollars have the potential to grow tax-exempt in the account.\\nTo see your potential savings with this method, try Vanguard Charitable’s Tax Savings Calculator.\\nCARES Act, and Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Relief Act deductions\\nUnder the CARES Act, which was made law in 2020, additional deductions became available—up to $300 per taxpayer ($600 for a married couple) in annual charitable contributions. This is available only to people who take the standard deduction (for taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions). (This temporary provision was extended through tax year 2021 by the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Relief Act of 2020.) As an “above the line” adjustment to income, it will reduce a donor’s adjusted gross income (AGI), and thereby reduce taxable income. A donation to a DAF does not qualify for this deduction.\\nHigher charitable deduction limits extended\\nAs part of the law, individuals and corporations that itemize can deduct much greater amounts of their contributions. Individuals can elect to deduct donations up to 100% of their 2021 AGI (up from 60% before the CARES Act). Corporations may deduct up to 25% of taxable income, up from the pre-CARES limit of 10%. The newer deduction is for gifts that go to a public charity. The old deduction rules apply to gifts to private foundations. The higher deduction does not apply to donations directly to a DAF (more on the CARES Act below).\\nQualified charitable donations (QCDs)\\nQCDs allow individuals aged 70½ and older to give traditional IRA funds to charity rather than taking them as IRS-mandated required minimum distributions (RMDs). In so doing, up to $100,000 of the traditional IRA funds may be exempt from taxes. It\\'s worth noting that donor-advised funds, however, currently cannot accept QCDs.\\nOther contributions\\nRetirement accounts\\nYou can remind clients that, generally, the deadline for making 2021 contributions to 401(k) accounts is December 31, depending on their employer\\'s retirement investing plans (the IRS, however, permits contributions to retirement accounts until the filing deadline—for the 2021 tax year, it\\'s April 15, 2022).\\n529 plans\\nMost states set December 31 as the deadline—for state-tax-benefit purposes—for contributions to 529 education accounts, although six states (Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin) set deadlines of April 15 of the following year.\\nImportant rules changes\\nRMDs\\nStarting in 2020, clients are no longer required to take RMDs on qualified retirement accounts at age 70½. For account holders who turn 70½ after December 31, 2019, RMDs don’t become mandatory until they reach age 72. The CARES Act affects RMDs this year even further (see below).\\nThe CARES Act\\nIn addition to its charitable giving features mentioned above, the CARES Act introduced several provisions with potential planning implications. With those provisions expiring, it\\'s worth reviewing the changes with clients:\\n\\nWaiver of the early withdrawal penalty on eligible retirement accounts—to put money in the pockets of individuals affected by the pandemic, the act suspended the 10% penalty for early withdrawals of coronavirus-related distributions up to $100,000 made between January 1 and December 31, 2020. While the penalty-free early withdrawal ability disappeared in 2021, individuals still have the opportunity to spread the tax on those withdrawals over three years; and they have three years from the time of distribution to return the money to their accounts.\\nTemporary waiver for RMDs—this temporary waiver applied to both 2020 RMDs and RMDs of those who turned 70½ in 2019 with RMDs that ordinarily would have come due in April 2020. The RMD was restored in 2021, so remind affected clients to take distributions as applicable. Anyone age 72 or older as of December 31, 2021, must take their RMD by year-end to avoid the 50% penalty―unless this is their first RMD, in which case they have until April 1, 2022.\\nFor small business employers and the self-employed, the act permitted a deferral of payroll taxes in 2020 to help businesses affected by the pandemic; those deferred taxes were to be repaid through the end of 2021 (and the IRS requires employers to collect and pay the 2020 payroll taxes even for former workers).\\n\\nRemember the people behind the portfolios\\nBy any measure, the extended uncertainty of the past couple of years has proven challenging. Your year-end check-in with clients serves as a valuable touchpoint. Clients want to know that you\\'re helping to efficiently grow their wealth. But it\\'s especially important to hear out other concerns clients may express:\\n\\nThey may feel exhausted after nearly two years of living and coping with the coronavirus pandemic.\\nThey might be dealing with, or at least worried about, the effects of longer-than-expected inflation that has accompanied global supply shortages.\\nThey may have concerns about how other issues—the ones in news headlines or more personal ones—could affect their well-being and their ability to reach financial and life goals.\\n\\nIt\\'s times like these when your role as a listener first, and emotional circuit breaker second, can deliver tremendous value and build trust. The Vanguard Advisor\\'s Alpha® framework is built around providing you with the tools to help unlock your value to clients, communicate that value to them, and strengthen client relationships.\\n1 Founded by Vanguard in 1997 as an independent 501(c)(3) organization, Vanguard Charitable strongly aligns with Vanguard\\'s principled investment philosophy and believes in the importance of long-term, strategic charitable planning through a donor-advised fund.\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal.

We foresee growth of around 4% for 2022.\\nConditions for continuing U.S. growth look favorable, even relative to pre-pandemic conditions.\\nUnlike the abrupt shutdown of the economy early in the pandemic, the reopening has been a more drawn-out process and, as such, the near term will continue to be excessively volatile, adding a high degree of uncertainty to the longer-run implications (see figure).\\n\\nThe key drivers of U.S. inflation are sending mixed signals\\nNotes: The chart depicts the absolute difference in standard deviation of observed readings from the 2019 trend. Dotted lines represent Vanguard forecasted values.\\nSources: Vanguard forecast and calculations, based on Refinitiv data. As of November 12, 2021.\\n\\nEuro area\\nVanguard expects the pace of growth to moderate, a natural slowing at this stage of economic recovery from the pandemic.\\n\\nCOVID-19 continues to be a concern—new cases topped 50,000 in Germany for the first time on November 11—and high energy prices weigh on household finances.\\nA rapid unwinding of supply bottlenecks that would boost manufacturing represents a risk to the upside, one especially pertinent to the euro area.\\nVanguard continues to see full-year 2021 euro area growth around 5% and 2022 growth around 4%.\\n\\nChina\\nWe foresee growth in the fourth quarter of around 1% compared with the third quarter, below trend, and of around 5% for all of 2022, below market expectations for growth around 5.5%.\\n\\nWe expect consumption recovery to remain muted, the property downturn to deepen and infrastructure investment to accelerate only after the National People's Congress in March.\\nWe expect the government to target growth around 5.5% for 2022; as such, we anticipate that it will need to tolerate an undershooting of its target or to introduce further stimulus measures.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nPositive health developments lead Vanguard to hold an above consensus view on 2022 growth in emerging markets of around 5.5% in 2022.\\n\\nWe anticipate that Latin America and emerging Asia, regions with high vaccine acceptance, will have vaccinated almost all eligible individuals who want to be vaccinated by the end of 2021.\\nWe expect the percentage of the vaccinated population to lag significantly behind in emerging Europe, where vaccine acceptance is low.\\nWe foresee vaccination rates in Africa, which have consistently lagged those of other regions, surpassing those in emerging Europe in the first half of 2022.\\n\\nThe Fed begins its tapering program\\nThe gradual removal of pandemic-era monetary policy accommodation in the United States has begun with the Federal Reserve’s announcement on November 3 that it would start to scale back its bond-buying program.\\n\\nThe Fed said it would reduce its purchases of Treasury securities by $10 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion per month so that November purchases total $70 billion and $35 billion, respectively, with a similar monthly reduction in purchases thereafter.\\nAt such a pace, the Fed's asset-purchase program will have wound down by the middle of 2022. The Fed said it was prepared to adjust the pace of purchases—up or down—as the economic outlook warranted.\\nThe move sets the stage for what Vanguard believes will be a late 2022 interest rate hike. If inflation evolves as Vanguard forecasts, it likely has already met its lift-off test and the Fed will turn its attention to the labor market to gauge the appropriate time for a rate hike\\n\\nWhat's next for U.S government funding?\\nThe threat of a U.S. government shutdown, a U.S. debt default, or both could arise in early December.\\n\\nTo avoid a shutdown in December, an omnibus appropriations bill funding the discretionary portion of the budget for the remainder of the fiscal year or another continuing resolution would need to be signed.\\nMeanwhile, Congress passed and the president on October 14 signed legislation to raise the U.S. debt ceiling by $480 billion, an amount expected to allow the government to pay its bills until at least December 3.\\nThe consequences of a U.S. debt default would be enormous—although Vanguard believes a U.S. debt default is unlikely.\\n\\nInflation likely to stay above 2%\\nVanguard’s medium-term outlook for inflation in the United States hasn’t materially changed despite a stronger-than-expected reading in October, although near-term inflation is likely to be pressured higher.\\n\\nCore Consumer Price Index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, reached 0.6% in October and 4.6% year-on-year. Strong readings over recent months have increased the possibility that supply constraints, labor shortages, and the effects of the economy’s reopening will take further time to normalize.\\nWe foresee inflation persisting above 2% toward the end of 2022. A risk that inflation persists at or above 3% by year-end 2022 would depend on broad wage gains taking hold.\\nVanguard sees the likelihood of strong wage gains in certain pandemic-affected sectors such as leisure and hospitality, but we see the risk of such strong gains across all industries as low.\\n\\nUnemployment continues falling\\nWith inflation likely to have already met the Federal Reserve’s criterion for an interest rate hike, we expect labor market developments to command attention in the coming months.\\n\\nThe unemployment rate fell from 4.8% to 4.6% in October, but we don’t expect the Fed to rely solely on that indicator in determining when to raise interest rates.\\nVanguard expects the unemployment rate to continue to fall, to just above 3% by the end of 2022, with labor-force participation peaking perhaps a full percentage point below its pre-pandemic level.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"Even during periods of strong market performance, not every investment will outperform market benchmarks. When clients' investment performance does not meet their expectations, it presents a great opportunity for advisors to incorporate holistic wealth and tax-planning discussions into client portfolio reviews.\\nBy developing a customized tax-loss harvesting (TLH) strategy in line with the profile of clients’ estimated capital gains, the market environment, and clients' personal tax situations, you can help to improve clients' after-tax returns.\\nHarvesting losses to offset gains\\nTLH involves realizing portfolio losses immediately and deferring expected capital gains. The value of TLH is twofold: potentially minimizing taxes over the investment horizon and deferring a current tax liability, with the extra cash flow earning a compounded market return over the investment horizon (see the following figure).\\nThe potential difference TLH can make\\nSource: Vanguard.\\nNote: This hypothetical illustration does not represent the return on any particular investment, and the rate is not guaranteed.\\n\\nFor many advisors and their clients, TLH is a year-end tactic to maximize portfolios' tax efficiency. However, by taking an annual approach, advisors may be missing attractive opportunities to harvest losses throughout the year. Additionally, using TLH software makes it possible to look for harvesting opportunities on a daily basis, which could result in a more sizable impact than monthly, quarterly, or year-end screening.\\nLooking across several wealth segments, the TLH value varies considerably among clients owing to differences in the market environment, tax rates, and capital gains. While TLH opportunities frequently present themselves during market declines, the strategy can also serve as a tactic in years when markets perform well.\\nThe next illustration shows that by evaluating a client's portfolio for losses on a daily basis, the potential TLH benefit is about 8 and 18 basis points (bps) greater, respectively, than with monthly and quarterly screening.\\nFrequency makes a difference in TLH benefit\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, using data from Qontigo.\\nNotes: Illustration depicts the annualized TLH benefit from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2019. The frequency on the x-axis indicates how often the portfolio was scanned for harvesting opportunities, which were identified as tax lots with at least a 10% loss relative to their cost basis. This analysis assumed quarterly cash flows of 25%, capital gains availability of 5% of the portfolio value, an eventual liquidation of 50%, a harvest tax rate of 32%, a liquidation tax rate of 15%, individual security-level harvesting, and a relative transaction cost of 25 bps. This hypothetical illustration does not represent the return on any particular investment, and the rate is not guaranteed.\\n\\nConsider direct indexing to save more\\nUsing a case study, Vanguard researchers explored the suitability of direct indexing for investors seeking daily tax-saving opportunities.1 Direct indexing (sometimes called personalized indexing) is a technology-driven investment solution that lets you offer high-net-worth clients custom portfolios at scale. This separately managed account strategy allows you to replicate an existing index while offering high-net-worth clients the expanded TLH opportunities that come with owning individual stocks and realizing losses daily to offset gains.\\nDifferent investors, different levels of TLH benefit\\nIn the following two illustrations, we use the example of four hypothetical investors to show how the TLH benefit differs across two different TLH strategies: one using index funds and the other using direct indexing.\\nFour TLH investor profiles\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, based on Federal Reserve Bulletin data (Neil Bhutta, Jesse Bricker, Andrew C. Chang, Lisa J. Dettling, Sarena Goodman, Joanne W. Hsu, Kevin B. Moore, Sarah Reber, Alice Henriques Volz, and Richard A. Windle, 2020.

(Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.)\\nNote: The results are for hypothetical investor profiles, are for illustrative purposes only, and are not a guarantee. TLH benefit (alpha) differential indicates the difference in the annualized TLH benefit between direct indexing (higher benefit) and index-fund harvesting scenarios.\\n\\nWhile the potential benefit of TLH depends on the investor's tax profile and level of income they can offset, the research revealed that for ultra-high-net-worth investors with sufficient income to offset capital gains up to $3,000 of ordinary income in a tax year, direct indexing can add significant value (~100 bps, over the time period analyzed).\\nWhen it comes to TLH, remember that one size does not fit all. By understanding your clients' complete financial pictures, you can help them determine if TLH is appropriate for them. If it is, you can develop a TLH strategy best suited for them, without introducing uncompensated risks into their portfolios.\\nLooking to operationalize TLH and other tax-planning strategies?

The index provider's assessment of a company, based on the company's level of involvement in a particular industry or the index provider's own ESG criteria, may differ from that of other funds or of the advisor's or an investor's assessment of such company. As a result, the companies deemed eligible by the index provider may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor and may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics. The evaluation of companies for ESG screening or integration is dependent on the timely and accurate reporting of ESG data by the companies. Successful application of the screens will depend on the index provider's proper identification and analysis of ESG data.\"},\n",

Effective tracking of such indexes typically can be achieved with minimal portfolio turnover—especially for equity indexes—and low-turnover strategies are inherently tax-efficient.\\nFurthermore, tax efficiency is built into the ETF ecosystem. Because ETFs trade on exchanges much like the way individual stocks do, the vast majority of trading in ETFs takes place between investors on the secondary market, with no impact on the ETFs\\' underlying securities.\\nA much smaller share of ETF trading occurs on the primary market, where ETFs create or redeem shares through transactions with financial institutions known as authorized participants. For most primary market transactions, ETF shares are exchanged for a basket of securities rather than cash. Such \"in-kind\" transactions are not considered taxable events and thus also contribute to ETFs\\' tax efficiency.\\nDraft legislation recently unveiled in the Senate proposes changes to the tax treatment of in-kind transactions. Vanguard opposes these changes and believes that the current tax treatment of in-kind transactions is in investors\\' best interest. We continuously work with policymakers to advocate for policies that give investors the best chance for investment success.\\nETFs are tax-efficient but not tax-free\\nInvestors should keep in mind that, although ETFs are highly tax-efficient, they may occasionally distribute capital gains. The primary goal of index-based ETFs is to track the target index as closely as possible. Maintaining tax efficiency is another important goal for Vanguard\\'s portfolio managers, but that\\'s ultimately one of multiple secondary objectives—which include managing transaction costs and adding benchmark-relative value—that Vanguard balances in the best interest of our diverse shareholder base.\\nAlthough the ETF creation/redemption process described earlier improves tax efficiency, realized capital gains distributions remain possible. Redeeming ETF shares in kind can minimize the ETFs\\' need to sell securities at a taxable gain, thereby reducing the need for realized gains to be distributed to ETF shareholders. But this process does not eliminate capital gains for shareholders, who will generally realize a taxable gain or a loss when they sell their ETF shares. Furthermore, ETFs may engage in taxable transactions to buy and sell securities, such as when a target index is rebalanced and certain securities are added to or removed from it.\\nAlthough several factors can contribute to ETFs\\' realization of capital gains, perhaps the most important is the consistent appreciation of an ETF\\'s holdings over an extended period. Global equities have generally enjoyed significant gains, with only brief interruptions, for more than a decade. As a result, many ETFs hold securities with unrealized capital gains that can become realized through the normal course of portfolio operations.\\nWhat investors should know\\nFor most investors, ETF capital gains distributions are simply a marginal reduction in the control that investors have over timing the realization of gains. Capital gains distributions by an ETF bring forward the payment of taxes that would otherwise be embedded in the ETF\\'s net asset value and therefore might be realized when the shares are eventually sold. Put another way, when an ETF distributes capital gains to its shareholders, taxes are paid on those gains now rather than at a future time when an investor sells the ETF shares at a gain.\\nKeep in mind that capital gains distributions generally have no impact on an ETF\\'s performance. Once the capital gains are distributed, the price of the ETF is generally reduced by the amount of the distribution. Note, too, that investors in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and retirement plans are generally unaffected by capital gains distributions.\\nA commitment to transparency\\nVanguard provides transparent and timely estimates of capital gains for all our mutual funds and ETFs. Estimated realized and unrealized gains for Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs are published and updated monthly on our website, and clients can expect to see an estimate of annual gains distributions published on the website each year in late November.\\nNotes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs, obtain a prospectus (or summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-997-2798 to request one. Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other important information are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing.\\nVanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'My first childhood memory is of sitting in the back of a station wagon with my brother. My mother was at the wheel, and we were in a long line waiting for gasoline. It might have been 1974; I learned, at some point, that an embargo by oil-producing nations had created shortages that led to even-and-odd-day rationing. The last number on our license plate was 8, so we could buy gasoline only on an even-numbered date.\\nI\\'ve thought about this recently because shortages of various goods and services, coupled with inflation like we\\'ve not seen in ages, have some observers wondering: Are we about to revisit the 1970s? I understand the concerns. Rapidly rising inflation eviscerated the economy then. The unemployment rate rose dramatically. It was a terrible environment for investors for two or three years.\\nI can tell you that, no, we\\'re not about to enter a period of stagflation—stagnant economic activity amid high unemployment and inflation—like the 1970s. We continue to anticipate economic growth and, unlike in the 1970s, demand for workers is high. Among several challenges, the most significant factor holding back the economy now is a lack of workers.\\nFigure 1. Supply, labor shortages act as a drag on growth\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, using data through September 30, 2021, from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nThe brown bars in Figure 1 represent economic output lost because of a shortage in the supply of goods—kitchen cabinets or whatever you want to buy—losses that have intensified since the pandemic started early in 2020. If you\\'re looking to buy a new or used car or trying to complete a home repair, you\\'ve likely experienced supply shortages firsthand. If you\\'ve been successful in your efforts, you may have paid more than you expected. Such supply tightness shouldn\\'t come as a surprise; for many workers, although their lives were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, their paychecks weren\\'t. Online demand grew incredibly strong at the same time production was disrupted globally.\\nNow, though, the shortage of workers, represented by the bluish-green bars in Figure 1, is starting to influence our forecasts more significantly. Although we still anticipate significant growth, we\\'ve lately downgraded growth forecasts for many countries and regions, and it\\'s not because demand is weak.\\nFigure 2. A crackdown on debt in China adds to growth pressures\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, using data from the People’s Bank of China and the U.S. Federal Reserve through 2019.\\n\\nAt the same time, China is working to mitigate leverage in the financial system, specifically in the property market. China is intentionally and permanently changing its business model, and I think the market underestimates this. China is no longer focused solely on driving real estate expansion and leverage to become a middle-income economy. When it fixates on a problem, it doesn\\'t let go, and now China is repivoting its growth model again.\\nReal estate has accounted for roughly 30% of China\\'s growth. In the United States, it accounted for, at most, from 10% to 15% before the global financial crisis. So there\\'s a concerted slowdown in China, although nothing alarming in the sense that we\\'d see a hard landing. But it\\'s coming at the same time that we\\'re seeing constraints on U.S. and European economies that want to run faster but can\\'t because of a lack of availability of goods and services.\\nFigure 3. Job openings per unemployed worker are at an all-time high\\nSource: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 30, 2021, through the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED database.\\n\\nSo how does this play out? We have growth slowing in the United States and China. We have oil prices shooting higher again. Is it going to be like 1974? The answer is clearly no. The one big difference—and it\\'s a material difference—between the environment in 1974 and the environment today is that demand for workers now is extremely high, as Figure 3 shows.\\nThe reason we have supply and labor shortages is because incomes have been growing, policy support from the federal government has been as large as it was in World War II, and now we have the economy coming back online. We\\'ve underestimated supply chain disruptions but demand wants to go further still. It\\'s why we\\'ll see higher inflation, but not a stagflationary environment.\\nFigure 4. Labor market red-hot in \"non-COVID\" sectors\\nSource: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 30, 2021, through the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED database.\\n\\nFigure 4 breaks down the number of openings per unemployed worker in three sectors—information technology; financial services; and professional services, such as law firms—that were not engaged in the face-to-face activities so disrupted by the pandemic. The ratio of job openings to unemployed or marginally employed workers in professional services? Two to one. I added the lighter-shaded bars to show the last time the labor market was ever this tight, and we\\'ve surpassed that.\\nThere is a genuine significant pressure on demand and we will continue to see it. Among the reasons these conditions have become so acute so quickly is that a number of workers have stopped looking for work. Part of this pressure will be relieved. Wages are starting to go up, which will draw workers back, and this is very positive news given some of the profound shocks that had hit the global economy. But this introduces different risks to the forecast. The risk in the next six months is growth that\\'s perhaps a little bit weaker than expected in the United States and some weakness in China with its real estate clampdown.\\nBut the darker-shaded bars in Figure 4 aren\\'t coming down very quickly, which means we have a shift in risk in the next 12 months. If in the near term there\\'s a modest downside risk to the markets, if they\\'re vulnerable to a downside risk to growth, the further-out risk is when the supply chain disruptions start to moderate. When all those cargo containers off the port of Los Angeles can finally be offloaded, we\\'ll have another issue: The Federal Reserve will need to normalize policy.\\nFigure 5. Monetary policy remains historically accommodative\\nNotes: Vanguard\\'s proprietary monetary policy measurement examines the effect of the policy rate, central bank asset purchases, and inflation relative to the neutral rate of interest to gauge how \"tight\" or \"loose\" policy is.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Laubach and Williams (2003), and Wu-Xia (2016). Accessed via Moody’s Data Buffet as of September 30, 2021.\\n\\nFigure 5 reflects Vanguard\\'s assessment of whether monetary policy is stimulative or tight. The higher the line, the tighter the conditions, which you tend to see if inflation is out of control and the labor market is already at full employment. The shaded areas represent recessions. The COVID-19 recession was deep, but it was so short that it barely registers on the chart. You can see how stimulative that monetary policy was—appropriately so—during the recovery from the global financial crisis. But monetary policy is more stimulative today than it was during the global financial crisis, and this isn\\'t a debt-deleveraging recovery. This chart doesn\\'t reflect fiscal policy, but if it did, we\\'d need another floor.\\nPolicymakers have been extremely successful in arresting a horrible shock. It\\'s a reason many companies didn\\'t go under. In one sense it was a heroic effort. But the critic in me says: Be careful of fighting the last war. If we wait too long to normalize, we\\'re going to have another issue on our hands, the potential for strong wage growth to fuel more persistent inflation. If we get past the supply chain issues, which I think we will, the Fed will have to be adept. It should not raise interest rates now in the face of a profound supply shock. But when those conditions are ameliorated, the Fed will need to have the conviction to raise rates in an environment where the inflation rate may be coming down and the labor market continues to tighten.\\nThe time of 0% interest rates should soon come to an end. That will help keep the growing risks of more permanent inflation at bay.\\n\\xa0\\nI’d like to thank Vanguard Americas chief economist Roger Aliaga-Díaz, Ph.D., and the Vanguard global economics team for their invaluable contributions to this commentary.'},\n",

For 2022, we expect growth around 3.5% to 4.0%.\\nAlthough health outcomes remain important, we expect the most severe outcomes to be mitigated by high vaccination rates among the most vulnerable individuals, and for economic sensitivity to virus spikes to wane through the fourth quarter.\\nGDP growth was a weaker-than-originally-expected 6.7% in the second quarter, according to the third and final estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\\n\\nEuro area\\nA consumption impulse whose timing trailed that of the United States and the United Kingdom is buoying growth and consumer confidence in the euro area.\\n\\nDespite some signs of an easing in momentum, we continue to foresee full-year GDP growth around 5%, which would put the euro area on track to reach its pre-pandemic level of growth in the fourth quarter.\\nWe foresee 2022 growth around 4%, lower than in the United Kingdom, where the pandemic-induced fall-off in growth was larger and there\\'s more ground to recover.\\nWe foresee the euro area reaching its pre-pandemic growth trajectory around the start of 2023.\\n\\nChina\\nThe economy in China grew by just 4.9% in the third quarter compared with a year earlier, below market expectations, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.\\n\\nWe foresee growth in the fourth quarter of around 1.0% compared with the third quarter, below trend and down from our earlier forecast of just above 1.5%.\\nSuch a more modest fourth-quarter rebound would come amid a backdrop of tightened controls in the property and energy sectors, which we see as representing fundamental shifts in China’s policy priorities that we expect to continue into 2022.\\nReflecting this more persistent nature of policy-related supply shocks and uncertainty, we\\'ve downgraded our view on China\\'s growth from a range of 8.0% to 8.5% to slightly below 8.0% in 2021 and to around 5.0% in 2022, both of which remain below consensus.\\nThe magnitude of the consumption and export-driven rebound in the fourth quarter and in 2022 will hinge critically on policy actions, both micro regulation and macro easing.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nGrowth in emerging markets is likely to depend in the medium term on inflation and central bank actions, including actions taken in developed markets that could spur some emerging markets to follow suit.\\n\\nWhere inflation is running high, such as Latin America, interest rate hikes have occurred and may not be finished—a headwind to growth.\\nWhere growth is the more immediate concern, however, including some markets in central Europe, rate hikes are less likely, and economic recovery from the pandemic is likely to have fewer obstacles.\\n\\nEmployment headed for a rebound?\\nWe anticipate monthly job gains averaging 700,000 the rest of the year.

       "  'content': 'Recessions can sorely test consumers. Unemployment rates generally rise and financial conditions deteriorate, leaving many less able to pay their bills and weakening their balance sheets.\\xa0\\nThe latest recession sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, though, was different. It led to an unprecedented spike in layoffs, but the finances of consumers actually improved as they spent less and—thanks in part to government stimulus relief—saved more.\\n\"Another differentiator this time around is how broad the consumer recovery has been,\" said Vanguard Principal and Co-Head of Structured Products Bob Behal. \"Our research shows that consumer credit profiles have improved in all income brackets, and the magnitude has been fairly large.\"\\nIn fact, consumers have accumulated \"excess\" savings of around $2.6 trillion—savings on top of what they would typically have had on hand—and that bodes well for the economy. If they open their wallets and spend more, they could fuel faster economic growth. And even if consumers remain cautious, they should be able to provide some cushion for the economy when activity inevitably slows.\\nCredit metrics tell the story\\n\"We looked at historical debt burdens, loan performance, and savings rates to develop a real-time picture of consumers\\' financial condition,\" said Mr. Behal. \"Unlike in past recessions when job losses caused households to draw from their savings, the opposite happened.\" Figure 1 shows the personal savings rate in the U.S. as a percentage of disposable income since 2000. While it was well below 10% during much of that period, it recently climbed to multiyear highs. Peaks in 2020 and 2021 roughly coincide with payments of government stimulus checks.\\nThe same figure shows the financial obligation ratio, a broad-based measure of the ratio of household debt payments to total disposable income. (Debt payments include estimates for revolving and installment debt, mortgage and rent payments, auto lease payments, homeowners\\' insurance, and property tax payments.) It has declined from levels above 16% throughout the 2000s and is currently sitting at a 20-year low of about 13%.\\nFigure 1: U.S. consumers have been saving more and avoiding debt\\nNotes: Data are from January 2000 through June 2021. The personal savings rate is a three-month rolling average.Source: Vanguard calculations using data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\\n\\nThese positive trends can be explained in large part by low interest rates, government stimulus, wage growth, and more stringent lending requirements. Consumer behavior may also be a contributing factor as households have shown some reluctance to take on debt since the global financial crisis.\\nOther metrics we track to gauge the health of the consumer include the unemployment rate and the rate at which credit card companies write off bad debt. Figure 2 shows that while the unemployment rate climbed to over 14% as large swaths of the economy were shuttered, the rate of bad loan charge-offs during the pandemic actually declined.\\nThat stands in sharp contrast to the more typical pattern during recessions, including the global financial crisis, when charge-offs tracked the rise in unemployment. In this recession, generous unemployment benefits and stimulus checks likely helped.\\nFigure 2: Credit card write-offs trended lower even as unemployment spiked during the pandemic\\nNote: Data are from January 2000 through July 2021.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations based on data from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nConsumers across the income spectrum are faring well\\nOne way we have attempted to quantify the breadth of the positive trajectory of consumer finances is by evaluating cash balances stratified by income. To do that, we used a measure tracked by the Federal Reserve, which is the sum of checkable deposits and currency, time deposits and short-term investments, and money market fund shares. This data series is a good proxy for the change in consumer savings, although it does not capture data for people outside the banking system.\\nFigure 3 shows that the change in cash equivalents has been increasing even during the pandemic for all three income cohorts. That stands in sharp contrast to the previous recession in 2007–2009, when we saw the more typical pattern—savings increased among higher-income earners but decreased among lower-income earners. The nature of the latest crisis, government stimulus payments and supplementary unemployment benefits, and the stability of other assets such as real estate and financial assets, appear to have left the consumer in better financial shape than expected at this point in the cycle.\\n\"While it\\'s good to see the credit profiles of higher-income cohorts improving,\" said Mr. Behal, \"the fact that lower-income cohorts are on the same trajectory is more unusual and could support a broader and longer-lasting economic upswing.\"\\nFigure 3: Consumers at all income levels are adding to their savings\\nNotes: Data are for the first quarter of 2000 through the first quarter of 2021 and show the trend in year-over-year change in cash equivalents. “Low income” represents the 1st to 40th percentiles of income earners, “medium income” represents the 41st to 80th percentiles, and “high income” represents the 81st to 100th percentiles according to U.S. Federal Reserve income data.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations based on data from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\\n\\nThe additional capacity, ability, and willingness of consumers at all income levels to keep current on their payments given the rise in savings levels may be translating to better credit performance. Figure 4 shows the percentage of all auto loans in the public securitized asset-backed securities market with payments that are at least 30 days overdue. The data is segmented by FICO credit score bands to quantify trends by consumer risk levels. Higher FICO scores signal less risk of default and increased capacity to pay. Lower scores would be expected to correspond to higher delinquency rates.\\nSeveral interesting findings can be gleaned from this data. In the initial stages of the pandemic, lenders offered loan payment relief that seems to have reduced delinquencies in all three risk cohorts. As each round of stimulus was distributed, delinquencies declined further. Finally, the highest-quality cohort, loans with a FICO score of 670 or more, performed in line with historic expectations. That\\'s important because it represents the cohort with the largest amount of outstanding loans and therefore provides further support that overall the U.S. consumer is in good financial health.\\nMarked drops in auto loan delinquencies coincide with the stimulus payments that were made, and subsequent increases appear as that effect wears off and the situation normalizes. It is encouraging that we\\'re not seeing a complete reversal, however, and delinquencies are still well below historical averages.\\nFigure 4: Past-due auto loans by FICO score are well below their historical average\\nNotes: \"Past due\" is defined as at least 30 days overdue. Data are from January 1, 2018, through June 1, 2021.\\nSources: Elicient SEC EDGAR filings and Vanguard.\\n\\nThe upshot of a strong U.S. consumer for the credit market and the economy\\nIn the credit market, the fundamentals of consumer-focused areas of the economy such as auto lending, unsecured credit, mortgage lending, banks, and retailers are strong and therefore favorable for risk taking. This trend could lead to expansion of credit if banks, as well as auto and other consumer lenders, broaden credit risk criteria to extend loans to lower-quality borrowers.\\nAsset-backed securitizations should do well because their structural protections are designed for recessions and current loan performance is well below these stresses. \"Our positioning in various credit funds reflects these views,\" said Mr. Behal. \"We have been generally overweight asset-backed securities and the U.S. financial services, consumer, and media/communications sectors. In addition, we have selective positions in sectors and companies that were hardest-hit by the pandemic and have benefited from the economy reopening.\"\\nPent-up demand for travel, hospitality, and leisure activities or even a reversion to the norm would suggest that consumers are going to spend more, and they have a lot of savings to do just that. On the other hand, the trend we\\'ve seen since the global financial crisis of consumers saving more and shying away from taking on debt could prevail.\\nWhile there are some signs indicating which way the situation might go—air travel has picked up and revolving loan balances have been increasing—it\\'s probably too early to call whether consumers are going to unleash a spending spree that would boost economic activity or keep more in reserve to fall back on in tougher times.\\nOther variables such as the Delta variant may also factor into the pace of normalization, but overall it does appear the consumer is better positioned going forward.\\nActive Fixed Income at Vanguard\\n* Includes funds advised by Wellington Management Company LLP.\\nNote: Data are as of June 30, 2021.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Markets weren\\'t too surprised to see a run-up in inflation in much of the world in 2021, aware that prices in a reopening economy would be compared with the low year-earlier prices that prevailed during COVID-19 lockdowns. But readings have been hotter than forecast as supply in a range of goods and even in labor has failed to keep up with resurgent demand.\\nWith accommodative monetary and fiscal policies expected to remain in place for some time, could inflation at rates we\\'ve seen in 2021 persist in 2022 and beyond?\\nIt\\'s not our base case. Our proprietary inflation forecast model, described in the recently published Vanguard research paper The inflation machine: How it works and where it\\'s going, tells us that the U.S. core Consumer Price Index (CPI) will likely cool from recent readings above 4% toward the U.S. Federal Reserve\\'s 2% average inflation target by mid-2022. Our model then foresees a further uptick toward the end of 2022, assuming fiscal stimulus of about $500 billion is enacted this year.\\n\"Fiscal stimulus, though, is a wild card,\" said Asawari Sathe, a Vanguard U.S. economist and the paper\\'s lead author. \"If we see $1 trillion or more in additional, unfunded fiscal spending enacted this year, core inflation could pick up more sustainably toward the end of 2022 or in 2023. This risk of persistently higher inflation is not fully anticipated by either the financial markets or the Federal Reserve forecasts and could lead the Fed to start raising short-term rates sooner than its present timetable of 2023.\"\\nWhat\\'s been driving U.S. inflation higher\\nOur research Vanguard economic and market outlook for 2021: Approaching the dawn envisioned a possible \"inflation scare\" as spare capacity was used up and recovery from the pandemic continued. Ensuing supply constraints affected a wide range of goods, however, contributing to a greater-than-expected surge in inflation. (The surge in 2021 is reflected in the first panel of Figure 1 below.)\\nNevertheless, most economists (including ours) believe that recent inflation readings that have more than doubled the Fed\\'s 2% target will prove transitory as supply issues are resolved and year-earlier numbers fade out of comparisons.\\nThe second panel of Figure 1, which shows key inflation drivers pointing in different directions, supports that view. Although solid economic growth and accommodative Fed and government fiscal policies would argue for inflation staying persistently high, significant labor market slack and stable measures of inflation expectations—what businesses and consumers expect to pay in the future—suggest that price increases may ease.\\nFigure 1. The key drivers of U.S. inflation are sending mixed signals\\nNote: Data cover the 50 years ended June 1, 2021.\\nSources: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Federal Reserve, using information from Refinitiv.\\n\\nThe challenges in forecasting inflation\\nInflation forecasting is a complex endeavor that must consider broad inputs whose relative importance can vary over time. They include:\\n\\nCyclical factors such as growth and labor market slack.\\nSecular forces such as technology and globalization, which tend to keep costs—and, by extension, prices—from rising.\\nFiscal and monetary policy.\\n\\nWith significant further stimulus being considered in Washington, fiscal policy is a particularly important factor right now in forecasting inflation.\\nOur model\\'s outlook for inflation: Higher than before the pandemic, but not runaway\\nWe used our model to identify the potential impact of rising fiscal spending on inflation through the end of 2022. For that purpose, we have assumed that both the policy decisions and inflation expectation “shocks” originate in the third quarter of 2021.\\n\"The output of all the scenarios we looked at suggest that risks are toward core inflation running higher than its pre-pandemic level of 2%, but that runaway inflation is not in the cards,\" said Maximilian Wieland, a Vanguard investment strategist and co-author of the research paper.\\nIn our baseline scenario, shown in Figure 2, we assume an additional $500 billion in fiscal stimulus and an increase of 20 basis points (bps) in inflation expectations. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) Our model suggests that would push core CPI to a year-over-year rate of 2.9% by the end of 2021. Continued stimulus and moderately greater inflation expectations would further push inflation—offset by stronger base effects (year-over-year comparisons with higher 2021 prices)—to 2.6% by year-end 2022.\\nIn our downside scenario, we envision no additional stimulus and a minimal rise in inflation expectations; in our upside scenario, we bump up our estimate for additional fiscal stimulus to about $1.5 trillion and for inflation expectations by 25 bps; and our \"Go Big\" scenario factors in substantial net additional fiscal stimulus (about $3 trillion spent over a year) and a marked jump (about 50 bps) in inflation expectations.\\nIn all our scenarios, the second and third quarters of 2022 suggest some weakness from baseline effects. But none of the scenarios results in the kind of runaway, 1970s-style inflation that some fear.\\nFigure 2. Scenarios for inflation based on potential fiscal stimulus\\n* The Fed’s 2% average inflation target is based on the core U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, which considers a more comprehensive array of goods and services than CPI does and can reweight expenditures as people substitute some goods and services for others.\\nNotes: The scenario data for the core CPI are Vanguard’s inflation machine model estimates for alternative fiscal stimulus spending. The downside scenario factors in $1.9 trillion in enacted fiscal stimulus and anticipates a 5 bps increase in the break-even inflation rate. The baseline scenario factors in $1.9 trillion in enacted fiscal stimulus and anticipates $500 billion in additional fiscal stimulus and a 20 bps increase in break-even inflation. The upside scenario factors in $1.9 trillion in enacted fiscal stimulus and anticipates $1.5 trillion in additional fiscal stimulus and a 25 bps increase in break-even inflation. The “Go Big” scenario factors in $1.9 trillion in enacted fiscal stimulus and anticipates $3 trillion in additional fiscal stimulus, a 50 bps increase in break-even inflation, and growth upside. All scenarios assume no change in the Fed’s monetary policy through 2022. We use the correlation between break-even inflation and long-term inflation expectations to adjust impacts in the model.\\nSources: Estimates as of September 1, 2021, using data from Thomson Reuters Datastream, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, and Moody’s Data Buffet, based on Vanguard’s inflation machine model.\\n\\nKey takeaways for investors\\nAlthough persistently higher inflation is not our base case, our model suggests that the consensus is too sanguine about inflation settling into its pre-pandemic trend of 2% in 2022.\\nIf inflation readings continue to come in higher than expected, it could lead the Fed to move up its schedule for raising short-term interest rates. That might be good news for investors, as today\\'s low rates constrain longer-term portfolio returns.\\nIncreased uncertainty about inflation highlights the importance of building a globally diversified portfolio, which gives investors exposure to regions with differing inflation environments.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Investment products with an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) focus are not new. The first such mutual funds go back decades, and Vanguard\\'s first ESG fund, Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund, was launched in 2000. What is new is the rapid recent growth in the array of ESG strategies and product offerings.\\nIn the year ended June 30, 2021, U.S. ESG assets under management grew 79%, to $313 billion, with index-based products taking in 67% of net cash flows. The number of products available surged the same year by 23%, to 454, across mutual funds and ETFs.\\nESG assets in U.S. mutual funds and ETFs\\nNote: Figures show the number of ESG-focused mutual funds and ETFs in the U.S. market and their aggregate assets under management as of June 30 each year since 2017. Source: Morningstar, Inc., as of June 30, 2021.\\n\\nSome investors have wondered why Vanguard\\'s ESG product lineup hasn\\'t grown at the same pace as the industry\\'s. While our ESG assets under management (AUM) have grown significantly during this time, we\\'ve introduced only one new ESG product for U.S. investors, Vanguard ESG U.S. Corporate Bond ETF, since the beginning of 2020.\\nBut the small number of new Vanguard products shouldn\\'t be interpreted as a statement on ESG investing. Our methodical approach to ESG product development has primarily to do with our ownership structure and core purpose. The ESG U.S. Corporate Bond ETF launch followed a multiyear research process that predated the recent surge.\\nTo be sure, all companies seek to do right by their owners—whether they are public shareholders or private shareholders. Vanguard is owned by our U.S. funds, which are owned by their investors. To do right by our owners, we strive to stand for all investors and give them the best chance for investment success. Therefore, one of our greatest responsibilities is the development of the products we put in the marketplace. Because of that, all product research follows a time-tested set of product design principles.\\nWhat are Vanguard\\'s product design principles?\\nOur product design approach rests on four essential questions:\\n\\nDoes the proposed product have enduring investment merit? We must have conviction a product is capitalizing on an investment thesis that has the potential to thrive for decades to come.\\nDoes it fulfill the long-term needs of its targeted clients? Because our investors are our owners, the product must contribute to their success as part of a well-diversified portfolio.\\nCan we deliver a compelling advantage over competitors? We assess how a Vanguard product can stand out in the marketplace. We look at factors such as in-house investment management capabilities across our indexing and active fixed income teams and our ability to secure the best external active equity managers at an advantageous price.\\nIs it feasible to launch the product? Finally, we assess all potential legal, regulatory, and operational constraints to ensure that the product is viable.\\n\\nA rigorous process guides every product launch\\n\\nProduct ideas are winnowed in a multitier approval process. It begins with our Portfolio Review Department, which is responsible for all aspects of product research, strategy, management, and manager search and oversight. Product proposals then go through due diligence review by our Global Investment Committee, led by Vanguard\\'s CEO. Ultimately, all approved product proposals move to our board of directors, which makes the final decision whether to proceed with a launch.\\nHow ESG figures into product design\\nAn ESG focus brings additional considerations into the product design process, focusing on how best to measure a strategy\\'s progress toward its objectives. Some ESG strategies place high priority on avoiding certain sectors or businesses while others actively seek to drive specified social outcomes or sustainability. ESG strategies may also hinge on whether companies are governed by a diverse board and demonstrate strong stewardship.\\n\"When considering new ESG products, we assess factors such as variations in index providers\\' methodologies or active managers\\' approaches, and general investor motivations and expectations,\" says Sarah Hersh, senior ESG product manager in the Portfolio Review Department. \"We also ask whether the product would be broadly diversified and how it may perform on investment and ESG outcomes, relative to an unconstrained parent index.\"\\nAs of today, Vanguard\\'s ESG lineup for U.S. investors consists of five products:\\n\\nFour are exclusionary index products, three equity and one fixed income, which are broadly diversified and seek to track benchmark indexes that are reasonably constructed and have transparent definitions of the sectors or business practices they seek to exclude.\\n\\nVanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV)\\nVanguard ESG International Stock ETF (VSGX)\\nVanguard FTSE Social Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFTAX)\\nVanguard ESG U.S. Corporate Bond ETF (VCEB)\\n\\n\\nThe fifth, Vanguard Global ESG Select Stock Fund (VESGX), is an active inclusionary product managed by Wellington Management Company LLP. The advisor seeks to identify companies that, among other characteristics, demonstrate ESG leadership and the potential for higher-than-average returns on equity.\\n\\n\"Our exclusionary products give investors a range of options for avoiding exposure to certain ESG risks or expressing their values,\" Ms. Hersh says. \"Our active product enables investors to access companies with a strong return on capital and leading stewardship practices, a combination the advisor expects to deliver alpha over the long term.\"\\nWhat\\'s next?\\nThe U.S. mutual fund and ETF industry is evolving to include a wider range of approaches. For example, impact investing is an active approach that explicitly seeks to generate positive total return and a real measurable social or environmental outcome. Thematic investing can use active or passive strategies to target companies with mandates such as encouraging energy transformation or addressing climate change. Inclusionary index products are often based on an ESG ratings provider\\'s assessment of company management of ESG issues.\\n\"ESG strategies are a significant focus area in our current research efforts,\" says Ms. Hersh. \"We have confidence in the merit of ESG investing broadly, and the thoroughness of our research process reflects our commitment to deliver enduring, compelling products to our clients.\"\\nWhile ESG investing is continually evolving, Vanguard\\'s commitment to our product design principles remains constant. We believe those principles will help ensure that any product we offer will benefit our investors—our owners.Notes: \\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs, obtain a prospectus (or summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-997-2798 to request one.

       "  'content': 'Crossover bonds are often seen as an attractive risk bucket on the credit-rating continuum. They tend to have lower credit risk than the broad high-yield market while providing more yield than higher-rated investment-grade bonds. As Figure 1 shows, over the long term they have produced attractive risk-adjusted returns—a measure of the return earned for the amount of risk taken. From April 2006 through August 2021, the average annualized risk-adjusted return for crossovers was 2.2%, compared with 2.0% for high yield and 1.2% for BBBs, based on data from Bloomberg.\\nFigure 1: Over time, crossovers tend to generate higher risk-adjusted returns than BBBs or high-yield\\nNotes: Data are two-year averages from April 2006 through August 2021.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from Bloomberg.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns.\\n\\nDuring times of economic stress, fallen angels are more prevalent. They typically underperform the debt of companies that get downgraded but remain within the investment-grade universe, in part because the buyer bases for investment-grade and high-yield bonds differ.\\nPrices rise more for rising stars\\nAnd when the economy is in a recovery phase, ratings upgrades tend to be more numerous, leading to a higher proportion of BB bonds migrating to investment grade. These rising stars typically see their spreads tighten and prices rise more than would be the case for an upgrade within the high-yield universe, in part because of their different buyer bases.\\n\"The price dislocations that occur with bonds crossing the dividing line between investment grade and high yield present opportunities for active bond managers,\" said Michael Chang, a U.S.-based Vanguard senior portfolio manager. \"Vanguard has a large, seasoned team of corporate credit analysts who work collaboratively across geographic regions to assess issuers\" credit profiles and, more importantly for our clients in this segment, where they may be headed.\"\\nEconomic downturns: Each time is different\\nThe recession we are just coming out of created a more challenging environment in some ways for crossovers than previous downturns did. It arrived after a decades-long run-up in the size of the corporate debt market. Figure 2 shows that growth was particularly strong in BBB debt in the decade after the global financial crisis, in part because of low interest rates and companies taking on debt.\\n\"Investors were concerned and cautious regarding the growth in outstanding BBB debt pre-COVID,\" said Michael Pollitt, a U.K.-based Vanguard senior credit analyst. \"Given where we were in the credit cycle, there were fears that an economic slowdown would trigger a wave of downgrades to high yield that the junk bond market might not be able to absorb easily and forced selling by institutions and index funds with investment-grade-only mandates.\"\\nFigure 2: Outstanding BBB debt has grown even faster than investment-grade debt overall\\nNote: Data cover outstanding debt from August 31, 2011, through September 8, 2021, and show the total outstanding debt for investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds and pan-European corporate bonds.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from Bloomberg.\\n\\nDowngrades for large issuers offered opportunity\\nThose fears proved overblown. The onset of the pandemic initially produced fallen angels at an unprecedented pace. During the first seven months of 2020, the S&P Global Ratings credit-rating agency downgraded 40 issuers of a collective $340 billion in debt to junk status globally, including big companies such as Occidental Petroleum, Kraft Heinz, Carnival, Delta Air Lines, Renault, and Ford. However, the major dislocation anticipated by the markets pre-pandemic didn\\'t materialize.\\nThis recession was also unusual in being largely caused by efforts to rein in a health crisis, not by more typical culprits such as an overheating economy, a bursting asset bubble, or an unexpected external shock. Sectors that are more sensitive to travel restrictions and other social-distancing measures—such as transportation, leisure, hospitality, and retail—were hit much harder than in other downturns and produced a larger proportion of fallen angels.\\nIn other ways, however, the latest recession has played out better than might have been expected. Unlike during the global financial crisis, many governments and central banks provided swift and unprecedented support to help lessen the pandemic\\'s blow by injecting liquidity into some of the most affected sectors. In the United States, for example, Congress provided three rounds of grants and loans totaling nearly $80 billion to airlines; regulators showed flexibility in airport slot usage and lease payments on toll roads; and the Federal Reserve made investment-grade bonds eligible for its asset-purchase program and set up several corporate credit facilities to provide a financing backstop that helped stabilize the market and support a swift recovery in bond spreads.\\nHolding onto some fallen angels\\nCredit-rating agencies responded positively to these developments and to a surprisingly fast recovery in corporate earnings overall. We have seen multiple positive rating actions this year from rating agencies. The fallen angel ArcelorMittal, for example, recently completed a round trip back to investment grade in just a little over a year.\\n\"In this environment, we were able to add significant value with crossovers,\" said Min Fang, a U.S.-based Vanguard credit analyst. \"We held on to some fallen angels that were fundamentally solid, which limited the potential loss from fire sales and resulted in outsized returns when those companies began to recover. We also provided liquidity to some corporations that were expected to recover over time—including airlines, cruise lines, and hotels—by purchasing new debt issued during the pandemic at very attractive levels.\"\\nWhere crossover opportunities stand now\\nHistorically, the ideal time to invest in fallen angels has been immediately after a downgrade to high yield. That\\'s because often most of the bad news has typically been priced in by the time of the downgrade. Since another wave of downgrades is unlikely at this point in the credit cycle, active managers still have the opportunity to try to add value by identifying potential rising stars well ahead of their being upgraded to investment-grade.\\nBy sector, prospects too have shifted. For industries and companies that were facing long-term decline before the pandemic, business conditions could deteriorate further. For example, nonessential brick-and-mortar retailers are likely to face more difficulties as online shopping has accelerated in popularity during the pandemic. As a result, some fallen angels in those industries may remain in high-yield territory.\\nOn the other hand, although some hard-hit industries such as airlines, hospitality, and leisure may see some structural damage to long-term demand for business travel, new demand spurred by global economic growth could provide some offsets. Fallen angels in these industries should recover over time to pre-COVID levels, enabling them to migrate back to investment grade.\\nNew trends in a post-COVID world\\nAnd industries that are well-positioned to benefit from new trends emerging in the post-COVID world—including digitization, remote working, and supply-chain reconfiguration—may also see benefits to profitability and thus potentially more rising stars.\\n\"The opportunity set within the crossover universe has narrowed as the global economy recovers from the recession, and the spreads of risk assets have meaningfully tightened over the past 12 months,\" said Bradley Marr, a U.S.-based Vanguard senior high-yield credit analyst.\\n\"We still have a number of avenues at our disposal, though, to add value: by avoiding fallen angels, as they can experience severe price declines; by taking advantage of market inefficiencies, whereby investing in these fallen angels has proven to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns; and by identifying rising stars, to take advantage of their potential for price appreciation in the event of an upgrade to investment grade.\"'},\n",

Premiums they must pay seem to be ever-escalating; the coronavirus pandemic has heightened health concerns. Such concern can be particularly acute for individuals who do not yet meet the age 65 minimum for Medicare eligibility.\\nHealth Savings Accounts (HSAs) provide a hedge against some of that uncertainty by providing a tax-sheltered, tax-deductible savings and investment vehicle. While the main purpose of HSAs is to defray health care costs, their flexibility also makes them a versatile and powerful tool for building wealth.\\nYou and your clients can learn more about HSAs; how to use them optimally; and important, recently enacted changes from a research paper in Vanguard's Financial Planning Perspectives series—HSAs: An-off-label prescription for retirement planning.\\nThe HSA basics\\n\\nWhat are they? HSAs are tax-sheltered savings accounts available only to those enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). An HSA provides tax benefits intended to defray the higher deductibles and out-of-pocket maximum costs of an HDHP.\\nWhy use them? In tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k) plans, you can pay taxes up front or defer them—either way, taxes will eventually come due. With an HSA, you are able to never pay tax—contributions and earnings are tax free. The tax savings can compound to produce higher returns than those available from other accounts.\\nHow to use them? How best to use an HSA depends on how much clients can afford to save. If they have enough savings ability, it’s best for them to treat their HSA as a long-term investment. In other words, they should pay for current medical expenses out of pocket. The more limited their ability to save, the more complex the decision.\\n\\nIt's difficult to overstate how powerfully an HSA can augment an individual's saving power, through the combined effects of tax-free contributions and compounding when invested.\\nWhile the funds are earmarked for qualified health-related expenses, in practice they can be used at any time for any purpose—provided the account owner has receipts for qualified health expenses that offset the withdrawal amount. Any individual health expense can only be claimed once. Therefore, accurate and organized recordkeeping is paramount. Note that withdrawals without offsetting, qualified expenses are subject to ordinary income tax and a 20% federal penalty tax for those under 65.\\nSo theoretically, a client could withdraw HSA money—tax-free—to pay for a semester of a child's college tuition; or for emergency house repairs. The only requirement would be to have enough documented, qualified, health-related expenses to offset the distribution amount.\\nOver the years individuals move, throw things away, and inevitably lose track of items they don’t use on a daily basis—such as deductible receipts. As an advisor, you can add significant value by helping clients to digitize and securely archive eligible health-related receipts (along with other important financial information).Taxes now, taxes later, or with an HSA, maybe never\\n\\n\\n\\nSavings account\\nContributions\\nInvestment growth\\nWithdrawals\\n\\n\\nHealth savings account\\nPre-tax\\nTax-deferred\\nTax-exempt*\\n\\n\\nRoth IRA or employer plan\\nTaxable\\nTax-deferred\\nTax-exempt\\n\\n\\nTraditional IRA or employer plan\\nPre-tax\\nTax-deferred\\nTaxable\\n\\n\\n529 plan\\nTaxable\\nTax-deferred\\nTax-exempt*\\n\\n\\nTaxable investment accounts\\nTaxable\\nTaxable\\nTaxable gains\\n\\n\\n\\n*Distributions must be offset by qualified expenses.\\nNotes: When taking withdrawals from a tax-deferred retirement\\xa0plan before age 59½, you may have to pay ordinary income tax plus a 10% federal penalty tax.

       "  'content': \"Markets are bracing for two near-term challenges related to U.S. government funding. Investors can be sure of one thing: We're in for a period of heightened, enveloping uncertainty.\\nThe immediate challenge is the potential for a government shutdown. That happens—frequently around the October 1 start of the fiscal year—when Congress hasn't authorized the approximately one-third of U.S. spending classified as discretionary. Absent a resolution to temporarily authorize spending, parts of the government will be shut down. It's never pleasant, especially for workers directly affected through the loss of a paycheck. But investors, the markets, and the economy have endured shutdowns before, and no doubt can do so again.\\nA second and potentially greater challenge could materialize around October 18 when, the Treasury Department has warned Congress, the government will no longer be able to pay all its bills unless the $28.5 trillion statutory debt ceiling is increased or suspended.\\nIncreases to the debt ceiling aren't new either. They've occurred dozens of times over the last century, mostly matter-of-factly, a tacit acknowledgement that the bills in question are for spending that Congress has already approved. Episodes in 2011 and 2013, however, were more contentious, leading a major ratings agency to downgrade U.S. debt in the 2011 instance. Failure to address the current challenge could shake global markets even before the Treasury has exhausted its available measures to pay bills.\\nA potential government shutdown: 21 and counting\\nA government shutdown would be the 22nd in 45 years. One was resolved within hours. The last one, in 2018–2019, was the longest on record, at 35 days. Interestingly, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has gained ground more times than it has lost during government shutdowns. And investors who have stayed the course have benefited from the market's penchant to rise over the long term. A greater risk may be that investors give in to the cloud of uncertainty, abandon a well-considered investment plan amid volatility, and lock in losses or miss out on gains.\\nEffects on the economy, meanwhile, typically are related to the duration of a shutdown. The 2018–2019 partial shutdown shaved $3 billion, or 0.02%, off U.S. GDP, after accounting for forgone activity later recouped.1\\nA potential U.S. debt default: Tarnishing a stellar credit history\\nA U.S. debt default, meanwhile, whether through delayed payments on interest owed on U.S. Treasuries or—more likely—on other obligations, would be unprecedented. Its broadest but not intangible effect would be one of perception. We don't doubt for a second the ability of the United States to pay for its obligations. Vanguard's assessment of the minimal credit risk posed by the United States is supported by its strong economic fundamentals, excellent market access and financing flexibility, favorable long-term prospects, and the dollar's status as a global reserve currency.\\nBut perception is tied to the reality that someone isn't going to be paid on time, whether it be government contractors, individuals who receive entitlement payments, or someone else. The damage to U.S. credibility would be irreversible. Even if a default were only technical—if payments other than interest on debt were delayed—the United States could no longer fully reap the benefits bestowed on the most reliable debtors.\\nInterest rates would likely rise, as would financing costs for businesses and individuals. Debt ratings would be at risk. The government's own financing costs, borne by taxpayers, would increase. Stock markets would likely be pressured as higher rates made companies' future cash flows less predictable. Such developments occurring while economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remains incomplete makes the potential scenario all the more important to avoid.\\nStaying the course continues to matter\\nVanguard is well-prepared from an operational standpoint in the event that a default can't be averted. We've taken measures to mitigate risk across the business. The course of events will depend in large part on how long any impasse may endure.\\nMarkets, meanwhile, may turn quickly, in either direction, and with each new development. They're forward-looking and don't like uncertainty, and that combination can result in sharp, sudden swings. Despite the uncertainty—but really, because of it—we continue to recommend that investors be guided by Vanguard's Principles for Investing Success, particularly to have the discipline to focus on a long-term plan even during periods of short-term upheaval.\\nWe don't believe, despite the degree of opposing views, that policymakers will allow a debt default to occur. The stakes are too high. We hope that resolution doesn't occur so late in the process that it inflicts lasting damage on the U.S. economy.\\nStay the course. It's what successful Vanguard investors have done for decades.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Congressional Budget Office, January 2019.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.\\nPast performance does not guarantee future results.\\nWhile U.S. Treasury or government agency securities provide substantial protection against credit risk, they do not protect investors against price changes due to changing interest rates. Unlike stocks and bonds, U.S. Treasury bills are guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest.\"},\n",

We maintain our view of full-year GDP growth of around 5%.\\n\\nOn September 9, the European Central Bank revised its full-year euro area growth forecast from 4.6% to 5.0%, bringing its view in line with ours.\\nGross domestic product grew by a seasonally adjusted 2.2% in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, according to the most recent estimate by Eurostat.\\n\\nChina\\nRisks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside in China, despite the most recent outbreak of the COVID-19 Delta variant appearing to be under control. Given the highly contagious nature of the Delta variant and the relatively low efficacy of China’s vaccine, the risk of further outbreaks and lockdowns remains elevated.\\n\\nWe continue to anticipate full-year economic growth in China at just below 8.5%.\\nChinese government data released September 15 showed slowing growth in both industrial production and retail sales.\\nAugust export data were stronger than expected, helped by a temporary diversion of orders from Southeast Asian nations dealing with COVID-19 and resilient demand from developed markets for tech-related and capital goods.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nCOVID-19 continues to have a divergent story in emerging markets. Emerging Asia, which we had anticipated at the start of the year would be the strongest emerging region for growth, has been beset by low vaccination rates and—given its many \"zero-COVID\" lockdowns—a low rate of infection-acquired immunity as well. The region has struggled with rising case counts.\\n\\nLatin America, which had been hit hard by the coronavirus around midyear, has continued to see case counts fall in recent weeks.\\nWe\\'re watching for the degree to which some of the world\\'s more developed emerging markets, such as South Korea, might be able to use their relatively higher vaccination rates to move away from zero-COVID lockdown approaches, which can weigh on growth.\\n\\nThe Feds asset-purchase tapering may begin sooner\\nMinutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s (FOMC\\'s) July 27–28 meeting suggest the Federal Reserve plans to start to reduce the pace of its asset purchases this year. We\\'ve changed our estimate of when such asset-purchase tapering may begin from the first quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2021.\\n\\nWe believe the Fed will want to see further strong labor market reports before formalizing a tapering plan. (A strong jobs report for July was followed by a relatively weak August report.)\\nThe July meeting minutes show that while most FOMC members believe the Fed has met its price-stability goal for initiating the removal of its policy recommendations, it hasn\\'t met its maximum-employment goal.\\n\\nInflation may not settle down as soon as expected\\nThe inflation environment is likely to be more volatile in coming years than we’ve come to expect recently. Vanguard’s view is that the consensus is too sanguine about inflation in the United States settling into its pre-pandemic trend of 2.0% in 2022.\\n\\nIn our base case, we anticipate that the core Consumer Price Index (CPI)—which excludes volatile food and energy prices—will come in around or above 3% through the first quarter of 2022, settle back just below 2% for some time, and end 2022 above the Federal Reserve\\'s target of 2%.\\nRisks for higher inflation include the potential that current supply-and-demand dislocations could prove less transitory than expected and that inflation expectations could become dislodged and put upward pressure on actual inflation.\\nGlobally, prices have risen as demand has returned to normal levels amid supply shortages in goods, services, and even labor.\\nWe foresee core inflation exceeding central bank targets in the United States and the United Kingdom in the months ahead and settling below the targets in China and the euro area.\\n\\nResurgent demand and supply constraints push up prices\\nNote: Data and Vanguard forecasts are for year-over-year percentage changes in the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Actual inflation is through July 2021 for the United States and the euro area and through June 2021 for the United Kingdom and China. Vanguard forecasts are presented thereafter.

Vanguard believes the number belies the strength of the U.S. labor market.\\n\\nVanguard continues to foresee the unemployment rate falling toward the mid-4% range by year-end.\\nProvided the rate of new COVID-19 Delta variant cases doesn’t require interventions that could change the trajectory of the economic recovery, we foresee a number of forces aligning that should spur a strong upswing in employment in the coming months.\\nThree-month average job growth stands at 750,000, and we anticipate average monthly job growth of around 700,000 for the rest of the year given businesses’ significant need for labor and the expiration of pandemic-related unemployment insurance benefits.\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal.\\nDiversification does not ensure a profit or protect against loss.\\nInvestments in bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.\\nInvestments in stocks or bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk.

The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Why should long-term investors care about market forecasts? Vanguard, after all, has long counseled investors to set a strategy based on their investment goals and to stick to it, tuning out the noise along the way.\\nThe answer, in short, is that market conditions change, sometimes in ways with long-term implications. Tuning out the noise—the day-to-day market chatter that can lead to impulsive, suboptimal decisions—remains important. But so does occasionally reassessing investment strategies to ensure that they rest upon reasonable expectations. It wouldn\\'t be reasonable, for example, for an investor to expect a 5% annual return from a bond portfolio, around the historical average, in our current low-rate environment.\\n\"Treat history with the respect it deserves,\" the late Vanguard founder John C. \"Jack\" Bogle said. \"Neither too much nor too little.\"1\\nIn fact, our Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM), the rigorous and thoughtful forecasting framework that we\\'ve honed over the years, suggests that investors should prepare for a decade of returns below historical averages for both stocks and bonds.\\nThe value of market forecasts rests on reasonable expectations\\nWe at Vanguard believe that the role of a forecast is to set reasonable expectations for uncertain outcomes upon which current decisions depend. In practical terms, the forecasts by Vanguard\\'s global economics and markets team inform our active managers\\' allocations and the longer-term allocation decisions in our multiasset and advice offers. We hope they also help clients set their own reasonable expectations.\\nBeing right more frequently than others is certainly a goal. But short of such a silver bullet, we believe that a good forecast objectively considers the broadest range of possible outcomes, clearly accounts for uncertainty, and complements a rigorous framework that allows for our views to be updated as facts bear out.\\nSo how have our market forecasts fared, and what lessons do they offer?\\nSome errors in our forecasts\\nNotes: The figures show the forecast and realized 10-year annualized returns for a 60% stock/40% bond portfolio, for U.S. equities and for ex-U.S. equities (all U.S. dollar-denominated). On each figure, the last point on the darker line is the actual annualized return from the 10 years beginning October 1, 2010, and ended September 30, 2020, and covers the same period as the Vanguard Capital Markets Model (VCMM) forecast as of September 30, 2010. The last points on the dashed line and the surrounding shaded area are our forecasts for annualized returns at the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of VCMM distributions as of July 31, 2021, for the 10 years ending July 31, 2031. VCMM simulations use the MSCI US Broad Market Index for U.S. equities, the MSCI All Country World ex USA Index for global ex-U.S. equities, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index for U.S. bonds, and the Bloomberg Global Aggregate ex-USD Index for ex-U.S. bonds. The 60/40 portfolio consists of 36% U.S. equities, 24% global ex-U.S. equities, 28% U.S. bonds, and 12% ex-U.S. bonds.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, using data from MSCI and Bloomberg.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\nIMPORTANT: The projections\\xa0and\\xa0other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM) regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. The distribution of return outcomes from the VCMM\\xa0is derived from 10,000 simulations for each modeled asset class.\\xa0Simulations for previous forecasts were as of September 30, 2010. Simulations for current forecasts are as of July 31, 2021. Results from the model may vary with each use and over time. For more information, please see Important information below.\\n\\nThe illustration shows that 10-year annualized returns for a 60% stock/40% bond portfolio over the last decade largely fell within our set of expectations, as informed by the VCMM. Returns for U.S. equities surpassed our expectations, while returns for ex-U.S. equities were lower than we had expected.\\nThe data reinforce our belief in balance and diversification. We believe that investors should hold a mix of stocks and bonds appropriate for their goals and should diversify these assets broadly, including globally.\\nYou may notice that our long-run forecasts for a diversified 60/40 portfolio haven\\'t been constant over the last decade, nor have the 60/40 market returns. Both rose toward the end of the decade, or 10 years after markets reached their depths as the global financial crisis was unfolding. Our framework recognized that although economic and financial conditions were poor during the crisis, future returns could be stronger than average. In that sense, our forecasts were appropriate in putting aside the trying emotional strains of the period and focusing on what was reasonable to expect.\\nOur outlook then was one of cautious optimism, a forecast that proved fairly accurate. Today, financial conditions are quite loose—some might even say exuberant. Our framework forecasts softer returns based on today\\'s ultralow interest rates and elevated U.S. stock market valuations. That can have important implications for how much we save and what we expect to earn on our investments.\\nWhy today\\'s valuation expansion limits future U.S. equity returns\\nValuation expansion has accounted for much of U.S. equities\\' greater-than-expected returns over a decade characterized by low growth and low interest rates. That is, investors have been willing, especially in the last few years, to buy a future dollar of U.S. company earnings at higher prices than they\\'d pay for those of ex-U.S. companies.\\nJust as low valuations during the global financial crisis supported U.S. equities\\' solid gains through the decade that followed, today\\'s high valuations suggest a far more difficult climb in the decade ahead. The big gains of recent years make similar gains tomorrow that much harder to come by unless fundamentals also change. U.S. companies will need to realize rich earnings in the years ahead for recent investor optimism to be similarly rewarded.\\nMore likely, according to our VCMM forecast, stocks in companies outside the United States will strongly outpace U.S. equities (PDF)—in the neighborhood of 3 percentage points a year—over the next decade.\\nWe encourage investors to look beyond the median, to a broader set between the 25th and 75th percentiles of potential outcomes produced by our model. At the lower end of that scale, annualized U.S. equity returns would be minuscule compared with the lofty double-digit annual returns of recent years.\\nWhat to expect in the decade ahead\\nThis brings me back to the value of forecasting: Our forecasts today tell us that investors shouldn\\'t expect the next decade to look like the last, and they\\'ll need to plan strategically to overcome a low-return environment. Knowing this, they may plan to save more, reduce expenses, delay goals (perhaps including retirement), and take on some active risk where appropriate.\\nAnd they may be wise to recall something else Jack Bogle said: \"Through all history, investments have been subject to a sort of Law of Gravity: What goes up must go down, and, oddly enough, what goes down must go up.\"2\\n\\xa0\\n1 John C.

The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.\\nCFA® is a registered trademark owned by CFA Institute.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"With the popularity of ETFs on the rise, trading volumes continue to beat records year over year. As a result, those of us on the Capital Markets desk are having numerous conversations about ETF structure and trading dynamics, with our goal being to help as many clients as possible achieve trading success through the best possible execution.\\nOne topic that keeps coming up is the trading of ETFs during the opening and closing auctions. For some of you more accustomed to traditional mutual funds, you find yourself wanting to place trades over the weekend, after the market has closed, or first thing in the morning. While that timing may work for mutual funds that strike a net asset value (NAV) only once a day at 4 p.m., Eastern time, it's not the best for ETFs. Trading ETFs in this manner results in the trade occurring during the opening auction, causing an unnecessary risk of trading the ETF at a larger premium or discount to its fair value, or NAV.\\nBy shining a light on the imbalances that can occur in the opening auction, we hope to provide the keys to help ensure clients have the best possible trading experience.\\nUnderstanding the mechanics of opening auctions can lead to better execution\\nWhen it comes to trading ETFs, the opening price can be dictated by the volume occurring in the auction rather than the price of the underlying securities that make up the ETF. Any trade submitted after the prior trading session ends but before the next begins is queued up for the opening auction, which can expose the trade to additional risks. If there is a large buy imbalance or large sell imbalance, the ETF price can swing to large premiums and discounts.\\nYou don't have to place a large order to receive a poor execution in the opening auction. If an imbalance exists in the opening auction created by other market participants, even the individual that submits a single-share order will participate in the collective execution that could be at a significant premium or discount to the ETF's fair value.\\nWhile exchanges tend to have orderly ETF opening and closing auctions and extreme imbalances with significant price impacts are rare, it's important to understand that the risk does exist, and pricing can be more volatile during ETF auctions without the creation/redemption mechanism. Remember that the creation/redemption mechanism helps ETFs remain close to fair value because new shares can be created or redeemed by liquidity providers who have clear insight into the value of the underlying securities in the fund.\\nWhat an orderly opening auction looks like\\nHere's an example where the opening auction operates in an orderly fashion. There are 10 investors attempting to buy varying share quantities of an ETF valued at $100 using a combination of market orders and limit orders. Simultaneously, there are 10 investors attempting to sell the same ETF. All 20 investors' orders are eligible for the opening auction. This example demonstrates an orderly opening with ETF buy orders perfectly matched against ETF sell orders.\\n\\n\\nETF opening auction (example 1)\\n\\n\\nBuy orders\\nSell orders\\n\\n\\nShare quantity\\nOrder type\\nLimit price\\nShare quantity\\nOrder type\\nLimit price\\n\\n\\n15,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n12,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n\\n\\n3,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n8,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n\\n\\n2,500\\nMarket\\n—\\n3,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n\\n\\n1,500\\nMarket\\n—\\n1,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n\\n\\n1,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n8,000\\nLimit\\n$ 100.01\\n\\n\\n500\\nMarket\\n—\\n4,100\\nLimit\\n$ 101.25\\n\\n\\n500\\nMarket\\n—\\n2,500\\nLimit\\n$ 102.00\\n\\n\\n1,000\\nLimit\\n$ 99.99\\n1,000\\nLimit\\n$ 102.50\\n\\n\\n500\\nLimit\\n$ 99.00\\n1,000\\nLimit\\n$ 103.00\\n\\n\\n200\\nLimit\\n$ 98.00\\n500\\nLimit\\n$ 104.00\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTotal shares: market buy orders\\nTotal shares: market sell orders\\n\\n\\n24,000\\n24,000\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nOpening imbalance\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Vanguard. This hypothetical example does not represent any particular investment.The 24,000 ETF shares would execute at an official opening price of $100, which is in line with the fair value of the fund. This happens because the 24,000 shares on the buy side are offset with the 24,000 shares on the sell side (market orders). As a result, there is no imbalance in the opening auction and the exchange is able to execute all orders without an impact on price.\\nWhat happens when there is an imbalance in the opening auction\\nIn this example, there are 10 investors attempting to buy varying share quantities of an ETF valued at $100 using a combination of market orders and limit orders. Simultaneously, there are 10 investors attempting to sell the same ETF. Again, all 20 investors' orders are eligible for the opening auction. However, this example denotes an opening imbalance that has surprising price ramifications for the ETF.\\n\\n\\nETF opening auction (example 2)\\n\\n\\nBuy orders\\nSell orders\\n\\n\\nShare quantity\\nOrder type\\nLimit price\\nShare quantity\\nOrder type\\nLimit price\\n\\n\\n50,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n3,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n\\n\\n3,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n1,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n\\n\\n1,000\\nMarket\\n—\\n25,000\\nLimit\\n$ 100.05\\n\\n\\n500\\nMarket\\n—\\n10,000\\nLimit\\n$ 100.25\\n\\n\\n100\\nMarket\\n—\\n8,000\\nLimit\\n$ 100.50\\n\\n\\n10,000\\nLimit\\n$ 99.95\\n4,100\\nLimit\\n$ 101.25\\n\\n\\n4,000\\nLimit\\n$ 99.50\\n2,500\\nLimit\\n$ 102.00\\n\\n\\n1,000\\nLimit\\n$ 99.25\\n1,000\\nLimit\\n$ 102.50\\n\\n\\n500\\nLimit\\n$ 99.00\\n1,000\\nLimit\\n$ 103.00\\n\\n\\n200\\nLimit\\n$ 98.00\\n500\\nLimit\\n$ 104.00\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTotal shares: market buy orders\\nTotal shares: market sell orders\\n\\n\\n54,600\\n4,000\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nOpening imbalance\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n50,600\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Vanguard. This hypothetical example does not represent any particular investment.In this example, 54,600 shares would execute at an official opening price of $102.50—250 basis points above the ETF's fair-value price of $100.\\nThe exchange executes all market orders—buy and sell—that participate in the opening auction (with certain exceptions).1 There are market sell orders for only 4,000 shares to try to offset the market buy orders for 54,600 shares, resulting in an opening imbalance of 50,600 shares.\\nThe imbalance forces the exchange to execute limit orders on the sell side starting at the lowest price until it is able to execute all the market buy orders that are part of the opening auction. Therefore, a single investor trying to buy 50,000 shares of an ETF can cause all other participants in the opening auction to trade at a price above the ETF's fair value.\\nGiven the risks of trading in the auctions, consider these best practices:\\n\\nAvoid trades (especially larger-sized trades) during the opening and closing auctions if possible.\\nIf you decide to trade in the auctions, consider using a limit order or marketable limit order to avoid unexpected price movements.\\nBe mindful about placing orders outside of normal market hours for thinly traded ETFs since the opening prices can be significantly affected.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Auction collars and exchange halts are a few examples when market orders may not receive execution in the opening auction.\\n\\xa0\\nNotes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs,\\xa0obtain a prospectus (or summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-997-2798 to request one.

Unexpected inflation, on the other hand, can erode portfolios\\' purchasing power, a challenge especially for investors with a shorter investment horizon, such as retirees.\\nDo certain asset classes weather unexpected inflation, like we\\'ve seen recently, better than others? Recent Vanguard research suggests that commodities stand apart as a vehicle for hedging against unexpected inflation.\\nOver the last three decades, commodities have had a statistically significant and largely consistent positive inflation beta, or predicted reaction to a unit of inflation. The research, led by Sue Wang, Ph.D., an assistant portfolio manager in Vanguard Quantitative Equity Group, found that over the last decade, commodities\\' inflation beta has fluctuated largely between 7 and 9. This suggests that a 1% rise in unexpected inflation would produce a 7% to 9% rise in commodities.1\\nCommodities’ inflation-hedging power has been strong and consistent\\nNotes: The blue line represents the rolling 10-year beta to unexpected inflation of the Bloomberg Commodity Index. The chart\\'s shading reflects the significance of the inflation beta, with darker shades corresponding to greater significance. Inflation beta significance is a statistical measure determined by both the magnitude and volatility of the beta. Inflation beta with greater significance has a larger potential impact as a hedging mechanism.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, using data from Bloomberg and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers through March 31, 2021.\\n\\nDo other asset classes offer hedges against inflation? Nominal bonds certainly don’t, as a simple fact of mathematics. \"You may not be able to predict the direction of interest rates, but the moment interest rates move, you know exactly what’s happening with your bonds,\" Ms. Wang explained. \"There\\'s not much uncertainty. Increases in inflation lead to higher rates, and bond prices decrease.\"\\nInflation-protected bonds are by their nature intended to hedge against inflation. But with a far lower beta to unexpected inflation (around 1), they would require a significantly higher portfolio allocation to achieve the same hedging effect as commodities.2 \\nThe discussion about equities as an inflation hedge is trickier. Our research reveals a sharp contrast in the hedging power of equities compared with that of commodities. \"Equities have a love-hate relationship with unexpected inflation,\" Ms. Wang said. The contrast presents itself as an inconsistency manifested in three distinct stages over the last three decades.\\nBroad stock index is not a consistent hedge against unexpected inflation\\nNotes: The blue line represents the rolling 10-year beta to unexpected inflation of the Russell 3000 Index. The chart\\'s shading reflects three distinct stages in the last three decades where unexpected inflation beta has undergone a marked shift.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, using data from FTSE Russell and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers through March 31, 2021.\\n\\nThe 1990s marked the \"hate\" stage of the love-hate relationship, Ms. Wang said. More than a decade after the Federal Reserve under then-Chairman Paul Volcker raised interest rates to double digits to combat inflation, the Russell 3000 Index, which represents about 98% of the U.S. equity market, had an unexpected inflation beta ranging from around negative 2 to around negative 9. That means a 1% rise in unexpected inflation would equate to a 2% to 9% decline in the index.\\nThe index\\'s unexpected inflation beta increased and at times turned positive in the 2000s, after the dot-com bubble burst. In the low-growth, low-inflation era of the 2010s, the markets determined that a little inflation wouldn\\'t be a bad thing, and the unexpected inflation beta turned positive and stayed there. \"Any signs of inflation after the global financial crisis were a positive signal for equities,\" Ms. Wang said. The beta has remained positive but has weakened in recent years, suggesting a market less sanguine about what inflation might mean for returns in the years ahead.\\nThe Vanguard research additionally finds that U.S. equities\\' hedging power is likely to decrease in the future, as commodity-related sectors including energy and materials constitute far less of the equity market, and sectors such as technology and consumer discretionary—not effective inflation hedges—constitute more relative to three decades ago.\\n\\xa0\\n1 The Vanguard research is based on the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which reflects futures price movements of commodity sectors including energy, grains, precious metals, industrial metals, livestock, and \"softs,\" such as coffee, cocoa, and sugar.\\n2 The total return of the Bloomberg Commodity Index consists of commodity return and the returns on collateral used in futures contract purchases. The Vanguard research found that using Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (as opposed to three-month Treasury bills) as collateral increased the unexpected inflation beta of the Bloomberg Commodity Index.Notes: \\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

Mobility data suggest activity may be leveling off, though not reversing, as case counts accelerate in some parts of the country. And even where vaccination rates are low, they're robust among those over age 65, who would otherwise most likely have the most adverse health outcomes.\\n\\nWe're watching the economy's resiliency closely, as U.S. output would need to hold around current levels to achieve full-year growth in our forecast range of 7.0% to 7.5%.\\nGDP increased at an annual rate of 6.5% in the second quarter, according to an advance estimate by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).\\n\\nEuro area\\nGrowth momentum remains strong, though high-frequency indicators suggest a modest softening in activity, particularly where cases of the COVID-19 Delta variant have risen.\\n\\nVanguard continues to expect growth in the third quarter to be slightly stronger than in the second, and that full-year growth could reach 5%.\\nGDP remains 3% below its pre-pandemic level, a gap that may be erased late this year.\\n\\nChina\\nIndicators of economic activity in China weakened in July, hit by the COVID-19 Delta variant, flooding in central China, and lagged effects of recent policy tightening. And given that much of the effect of the COVID-19-related lockdowns isn’t reflected in the July numbers, the worst may be yet to come in August.\\n\\nVanguard has downgraded its expectation for third-quarter GDP growth from 1.0% to 0.5%.\\nWe anticipate China's full-year economic growth at just below 8.5%.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nLow COVID-19 vaccination levels have put any impulses toward accelerated growth in emerging markets on hold likely until late this year or early next year, when an anticipated ramp-up in vaccine production is likely to bolster supply.\\n\\nVanguard foresees full-year growth for emerging markets above 6%, with COVID-19 management playing an important role.\\nCountries that have had the most success in warding off COVID-19, notably in Asia, may be at greatest risk of having to initiate further restrictions on economic activity.\\n\\nThe Fed continues to hold the line on rates\\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted on July 28 to leave the target range for its federal funds rate unchanged at 0%–0.25% and its bond buying program unchanged. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that the two components of the Fed’s dual mandate—price stability and maximum sustainable employment—have been “in tension” lately, with inflation having risen higher than the Fed had expected, but with further recovery still to come in the labor market.\\n\\nAlthough the Fed sees inflation at recent levels as transitory, it sees risks as skewed to the upside.\\nVanguard believes the Fed will want to see further labor market gains in the months ahead before it starts paring its pace of asset purchases—and we believe the Fed will indeed see those gains.\\n\\nWatching inflation closely\\nThe most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) release in the United States was consistent with Vanguard's view that prices would begin to moderate after running high in recent months. Still, we're watching closely to determine whether recent higher inflation figures are likely to persist.\\n\\nWe believe that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE), the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure in considering interest rate targets, will remain above the Fed's 2% inflation target until the spring of 2022.\\nPCE differs from CPI in that it measures prices of a broader array of goods and can reweight expenditures as consumers substitute some goods and services for others. Core PCE and CPI exclude volatile food and energy prices.\\n\\nThe potency of commodities as an inflation hedge\\nFinancial markets expect a certain level of inflation and factor it into the asset prices they set, a condition theoretically neutral for investment portfolios. Unexpected inflation, on the other hand, can erode portfolios’ purchasing power, a challenge especially for retirees.\\n\\nRecent Vanguard research suggests that commodities stand apart as a vehicle for hedging against unexpected inflation.\\nOver the last three decades, commodities have had a statistically significant and largely consistent positive inflation beta, or predicted reaction to a unit of inflation.\\n\\nCommodities’ inflation-hedging power has been strong and consistent\\nNotes: The green line represents the rolling 10-year beta to unexpected inflation of the Bloomberg Commodity Index. The chart's shading reflects the significance of the inflation beta, with darker shades corresponding to greater significance. Inflation beta significance is a statistical measure determined by both the magnitude and volatility of the beta. Inflation beta with greater significance has a larger potential impact as a hedging mechanism.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, using data from Bloomberg and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers through March 31, 2021.\\n\\nThe stage is set for stronger job gains\\nWe see a number of forces aligning that should spur a strong upswing in employment in the coming months and pave the way for a full labor-market recovery by mid-2022.\\n\\nSeveral factors contribute to our optimistic outlook. Vaccination rates by September should near their peak. Schools are set to reopen with in-person classes, making more stay-at-home parents available to take jobs.\\nThere's the looming expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits and CARES Act unemployment coverage for workers not traditionally covered by unemployment insurance.\\nVanguard expects monthly job gains to average around 650,000 for the rest of the year, and for the unemployment rate, currently at 5.4%, to fall toward the mid-4.0% range by year-end.\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal.\\nDiversification does not ensure a profit or protect against loss.\\nInvestments in bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.\\nInvestments in stocks or bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk. These risks are especially high in emerging markets.\\nFunds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility.\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. VCMM results will vary with each use and over time.\\nThe VCMM projections are based on a statistical analysis of historical data. Future returns may behave differently from the historical patterns captured in the VCMM. More important, the VCMM may be underestimating extreme negative scenarios unobserved in the historical period on which the model estimation is based.\\nThe Vanguard Capital Markets Model is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguard's primary investment research and advice teams. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data from as early as 1960. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time. The model generates a large set of simulated outcomes for each asset class over several time horizons. Forecasts are obtained by computing measures of central tendency in these simulations. Results produced by the tool will vary with each use and over time.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"Faced with a market environment of historically low bond yields and interest rates, advisors may be struggling to find a suitable bond portfolio construction approach for their clients. Lower yields mean the bond portion of a portfolio generates less income. It also means that it is increasingly difficult for investors to hit certain yield targets without taking on a greater level of portfolio risk.\\nYour search for yield may lead you to consider an overweight to dividend-paying stocks or differentiated fixed income investments such as high-yield and emerging markets bonds. However, dividend strategies come with a higher level of risk than most bond offerings while not diversifying equity risk. And the aforementioned fixed income investments can meaningfully change the risk profile of a client’s bond allocation.\\nCorporate bond ETFs can enhance the income potential of a bond allocation\\nU.S. investment-grade corporate bonds, particularly when accessed via ETFs, are a good way to enhance the income potential in a bond portfolio in a risk-aware, low-cost manner, while also potentially improving long-term risk-adjusted returns.\\nCurrently, the yield to maturity on a broad-market investment-grade corporate bond ETF such as Vanguard Total Corporate Bond ETF (VTC), is 2.09%, a premium of 0.59% over the yield to maturity on the U.S. aggregate bond market and 1.14% premium over the yield to maturity on the broad U.S. Treasury market.1\\nIt's important to keep in mind that credit risk—the risk that companies may be downgraded or default on their debt—is what mainly drives the yield premium. While this credit risk leads corporate bonds to have a higher return correlation to stocks than to U.S. Treasuries, corporate bonds still offer risk-reduction benefits relative to an equity allocation. And most U.S. investment-grade bonds tend to be of high quality, having an average credit-quality rating of A–.\\nWhy ETFs for corporate bond exposure?\\nETFs have become an established vehicle for investing in the corporate bond market given their diversification, low-cost, versatility, and tax efficiency. We've seen explosive growth in U.S. investment-grade corporate bond ETFs over the past 10 years in both assets under management (AUM) and product count.\\nGrowth of corporate bond ETFs\\nSource: Vanguard, using Morningstar data, as of June 30, 2021.\\nNote: Based on U.S.-listed, ex-ETN (exchange-traded note) issues only. Corporate bond ETF AUM and product count are inclusive of Morningstar’s Corporate Bond category as well as ETFs in the Short Bond and Long Bond categories that have at least 80% of assets invested in corporate bonds.\\n\\nEvaluating corporate bond ETFs\\nWhen evaluating corporate bond ETFs, here are three important things to consider:\\n1. The exposure offered by the ETF\\nUnderstanding the index methodology behind the ETF is critical to help ensure it fits as an appropriate component in the portfolio. Corporate bond ETFs can be differentiated by their maturity/duration exposure (for instance, broad market or short-, intermediate-, or long-term), their credit quality (for instance, some focus on bonds rated at or above one particular rating), or the types of companies they focus on (e.g., sub-sectors or companies that pass certain ESG [environmental, social, and governance] screens).\\xa0\\n2. The ability of the fund manager to tightly track the index\\nUnlike in most equity index ETFs, it is nearly impossible for a bond ETF to own every bond in the index in its precise weight. This is especially true when it comes to the corporate bond market.\\nIn order to tightly track a benchmark, the manager must employ a sophisticated process of optimization.\\nOur optimization process entails replicating the risk factors of a bond ETF’s benchmark. Every day, we match the ETF’s exposures to duration, credit quality, sector exposure, and many more factors to those of the benchmark, within a fraction of a basis point. We strive to own 90%-plus of the bonds in each benchmark, meaning there are thousands of bonds in our diversified index ETFs.\\n3. Investment costs\\nETFs have lowered the cost of investing in the corporate bond market dramatically. In 2010, the average corporate bond mutual fund expense ratio was 0.97%.2 Compare that with the 2020 average corporate bond ETF expense ratio of 0.18%, and you can see the impact ETFs have had on lowering costs in this segment of the bond market.2\\nETFs also confer transaction-cost liquidity. Because it trades on an exchange, the bid-ask spread for a bond ETF depends not only on the liquidity of its underlying bonds but also on its own trading volume. Many corporate bond ETFs are among the most traded ETFs in the world, trading at spreads that are a tiny fraction of the basket spreads, or implicit cost of investing in all the bonds they hold.\\xa0\\nVanguard corporate bond ETFs trade at a fraction of the cost of their underlying bonds\\nSource: Vanguard, using Bloomberg data as of June 30, 2021.\\nNote: Vanguard estimated the underlying bond bid-ask spread using Bond Liquidity Analysis, a proprietary calculation that uses Bloomberg data to estimate an aggregated bid-ask spread for the underlying portfolio of bonds for the 20 trading days ended June 30, 2021.\\n\\nOur corporate bond ETFs offer a maturity-segmented approach\\nAs one of the largest managers of corporate bond ETFs, including Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT)—the largest corporate bond ETF in the world, we bring a wealth of bond-indexing expertise and experience to our lineup.3 \\nVanguard ETF® (ticker) and expense ratio4\\nTotal Corporate Bond ETF (VTC)\\xa0 \\xa00.05%\\nShort-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCSH)\\xa0 \\xa00.05%\\nIntermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT)\\xa0 \\xa00.05%\\nLong-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCLT)\\xa0 \\xa00.05%\\nESG U.S. Corporate Bond ETF (VCEB)\\xa0 \\xa00.12%\\n\\xa0\\n1 Source: Bloomberg Barclays indexes as of June 30, 2021.\\n2 Source: Vanguard, using Morningstar, Inc., data as of December 31, 2020.\\n3 Source: Morningstar, Inc., as of June 30, 2021.\\n4 As reported in each fund's most recent prospectus.

While the markets have calmed and the global economy—despite ongoing public health challenges— continues to emerge from a short but severe recession, it\\'s a good time to reflect on the pandemic\\'s impact on the markets, particularly fixed income.\\nThe \"dash for cash\"\\nFixed income investors responded to the economic shock of the pandemic by rapidly selling assets to bolster their liquidity positions in a dash for cash. This broad divestment overwhelmed traditional channels, leading to a liquidity crunch and price dislocations across multiple fixed income sectors. Even the traditional safe haven of the U.S. Treasury markets experienced notable pressures. The volatility quickly spread to other fixed income sectors across the U.S. and Europe, including commercial paper, corporate bonds, variable-rate demand notes, mortgage-backed securities, and municipal bonds.\\nCauses of the liquidity crunch\\nSeveral factors influenced the strain on the fixed income markets. The general size and complexity of global fixed income markets, the magnitude of selling pressure in certain asset classes, dealers\\' willingness or ability to warehouse assets, and the evolution of fixed income market structure over time all contributed to the breakdown in dealer intermediation. Swift and comprehensive intervention by central banks and policymakers helped restore normal market functioning, with central banks acting as a key liquidity provider and market-maker of last resort.\\nWhat\\'s to be done?\\nAs our research points out, to reduce the likelihood of future intervention by central banks, any policy response should consider ways to enhance the market structure for U.S. Treasury securities, such as ensuring that policymakers have the data necessary to properly surveil the U.S. Treasury market, facilitate market functioning under stress, and inform future regulatory actions. Further, reforms that would foster continuous market-making and improved transparency should be considered. The market for U.S. Treasury securities is a vital part of our global fixed income markets and must be resilient during times of market stress.'},\n",

Government programs, including enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks delivered directly to lower-income earners, have supported consumer spending.\\n\\nThe first estimate of second-quarter GDP in the United States by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is likely to show strong growth, though perhaps below the double digits that some market participants may expect. Vanguard looks for the pace of growth to slow in the second half, though remain strong as positive health outcomes drive a broader reopening of the economy.\\nWe continue to foresee full-year growth of at least 7%, with activity likely peaking late in the second quarter and early in the third.\\n\\nEuro area\\nHigh-frequency indicators, including aggregate purchasing managers\\' indexes near 15-year highs, support Vanguard\\'s view that growth in the euro area hasn\\'t yet peaked. We expect that peak to occur in the third quarter, and we continue to anticipate that the region will experience full-year growth around 4% to 5%.\\n\\nWe expect the recovery to be led by a substantial rebound in consumption in the coming months. The global economic recovery, meanwhile, is supportive of export growth in Germany and Italy.\\nVanguard believes euro area GDP will reach its pre-pandemic level in the first quarter of 2022.\\n\\nChina\\nGrowth momentum in China has faded in recent months in response to tighter fiscal and monetary policy and slowing export growth. We expect support from the export sector to wane and consumption growth to normalize slowly, given sporadic virus outbreaks and an initially slow vaccination rollout.\\n\\nChina\\'s composite purchasing managers\\' index remains above the 50 level that signifies growth, but the reading has fallen for two straight months, evidence of the slowing momentum.\\nThat slowing momentum recently led Vanguard to cut its full-year forecast for China growth from 9% to just above 8.5%.\\n\\nEmerging markets\\nVirus resurgence, particularly in emerging Asia, has slowed first-half 2021 growth. Vanguard remains optimistic that emerging markets will post full-year 2021 growth above 6%, which is above consensus.\\n\\nWe believe that emerging markets could get a bounce in 2022, as well, from strengthening developed markets.\\nOur view depends to no small degree on the pace to which emerging markets can accelerate their vaccination efforts.\\n\\nA strong but uneven global recovery\\nThe degree to which economic activity can resume depends on the staying power of COVID-19 and its variants.\\n\\nVaccination progress suggests an uneven global economic recovery. Consumers are more likely to engage in face-to-face economic activity where vaccination rates are greatest.\\nEmerging markets remain at greater risk from COVID-19 and its variants than developed markets given the pace of vaccinations.\\n\\nPercentage of population with at least one vaccine dose\\nNotes: Levels that constitute herd immunity will vary by region, depending on vaccine efficacy. Higher vaccination rates generally permit greater economic activity.\\nSources: Vanguard projections, based on data from Our World in Data, the University of Oxford, and the Australian federal government as of June 1, 2021. No projections are available for Canada and Mexico.\\n\\nPersistent inflation remains a risk\\nProspects for stimulative fiscal policy and only a gradual readjustment of a supply-and-demand imbalance increase the likelihood of moderately higher inflation more persistently. We don\\'t, however, foresee a return to 1970s-style runaway inflation. There is a risk that significantly more fiscal spending on the order of $2 trillion to $3 trillion—our \"go big\" scenario in the chart below—could lead inflation to significantly overshoot the Fed\\'s target later this year and into 2022.\\n\\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States rose by a greater-than-expected 0.9% in June compared with May, and 5.4% since June 2020, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday, July 13.\\nThe rises were the greatest for both readings since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.9% compared with May and 4.5% compared with June 2020.\\nThe index for used cars and trucks, up 10.5% in June, accounted for more than a third of the seasonally adjusted all-items increase.\\nVanguard sees a risk that inflation could be more persistent if sectoral drivers of inflation remain strong. The Federal Reserve\\'s preferred measure of inflation, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), moderated somewhat in May, rising 0.4% compared with a month earlier after a revised 0.6% gain in April.\\nCompared with a year earlier, core PCE increased by 3.9% in May, higher than the 3.6% increase in April.\\nVanguard expects year-on-year readings of core PCE to remain above 2% into 2022 amid supply constraints that could push sector-level prices higher.\\n\\nInflation: Up, up … but not away in 2021\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from January 1995 through April 2021 from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nFed likely to remain dovish\\nWe foresee accommodative policy remaining in place the rest of the year, though talk of reducing the pace of asset purchases will ramp up in the second half. We don\\'t foresee conditions meeting the Federal Reserve\\'s rate-hike criteria until the second half of 2023.\\n\\nThe U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted on June 16 to leave the target range for its federal funds rate unchanged at 0%–0.25% and its bond-buying program unchanged. A survey of FOMC members, however, suggested the Fed now foresees the timing of its first post-pandemic rate hikes in 2023, rather than in 2024 as per the previous survey, in March.\\nVanguard expects the Fed\\'s balance sheet guidance to ramp up in the second half of 2021 amid economic uncertainty that remains high.\\nWe expect policy largely to remain dovish, with the Fed tolerating above-target inflation over the medium term.\\nGlobally, we find that central bank policy rates and interest rates more broadly are likely to rise, but only modestly, in the next several years.\\nOur view that lift-off from current low policy rates may occur in some cases only two years from now reflects, among other things, an only gradual recovery from the pandemic’s significant effect on labor markets.\\nAlongside rises in policy rates, Vanguard expects central banks, in our base-case \"reflation\" scenario, to slow and eventually stop their purchases of government bonds, allowing the size of their balance sheets as a percentage of GDP to fall back toward pre-pandemic levels.\\nWe expect higher policy rates and smaller central bank balance sheets to cause only a modest lift in yields.\\n\\nUnemployment rate expected to fall\\nThe job market in the United States gained momentum in June, as 850,000 non-farm jobs were created.\\n\\nVanguard expects monthly job gains to average around 650,000 for the rest of the year, and for the unemployment rate, currently at 5.9%, to fall toward the mid-4% range by year-end.\\nIn the leisure and hospitality sector, job-churning (workers\\' leaving one employer for another) is at 20-year highs amid fierce labor competition. We see that situation normalizing in the months ahead.\\nLabor force dynamics could change noticeably around September as enhanced unemployment benefits and CARES Act unemployment coverage of workers not traditionally covered expire, as schoolchildren return to classrooms allowing parents to return to workplaces, and as vaccination rates near their peak.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The outlook for the global economy continues to hinge on health outcomes. In our annual economic and market outlook published at the end of 2020, Vanguard economists expected that the path to recovery would be uneven and varied across industries and countries, even once effective vaccines for COVID-19 became available.\\nFast forward half a year. The pandemic is still far from over as new virus variants surface where vaccination rates lag and as the human toll continues to mount, especially in less developed economies. Yet macroeconomic indicators signal that the global economy is rebounding faster than many had expected from its sharpest contraction in modern history. That rebound is reflected in our current full-year GDP growth forecasts, which remain roughly in line with our optimistic projections at the start of 2021. In some places, we've upgraded our forecasts; in others, we've downgraded them.\\xa0\\nCountries that have contained the virus more successfully, whether through vaccinations, lockdowns, or both, have tended to see their economies hold up better, said Andrew Patterson, senior international economist in Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group. As economies open up, demand—supported in many countries by government spending—will promote growth and, by extension, underlie our outlooks for inflation and monetary policy. Given Vanguard’s focus on return expectations over the long term, revisions to our investment return outlooks remain a function of valuations and risks informed by current and expected future macroeconomic conditions and policy.\\nVaccination rates and fiscal support are driving the economic recovery\\nThe extraordinary global response to the pandemic has set the stage for a strong economic recovery. Vaccines were developed, tested, and made available faster than many anticipated. By our estimates, shown in the chart below, about 75% of the world's population will have received at least one vaccine dose by the end of 2021, putting herd immunity in the largest economies within reach.1 The reaction of governments and central banks has also been impressive, as many moved swiftly to provide unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary support.\\nPercentage of population with at least one vaccine dose\\nNotes: Levels that constitute herd immunity will vary by region, depending on vaccine efficacy. Higher vaccination rates generally permit greater economic activity.\\nSources: Vanguard projections, based on data from Our World in Data, the University of Oxford, and the Australian federal government as of June 1, 2021. No projections are available for Canada and Mexico.\\n\\nAt the same time, the chart shows that vaccination rates have differed significantly by country and region. So have outcomes from policymakers' efforts to blunt COVID-19's economic impact. Both factors are likely to contribute to the recovery’s continued unevenness for the rest of this year and beyond.\\nOur full-year GDP growth forecasts still reflect how far we’ve had to climb back to approach pre-pandemic growth. In the United States, for example, where positive health care developments and strong fiscal support are driving growth, we’ve raised our full-year forecast to at least 7%. Vaccination programs accelerated after a somewhat slow start, paving the way for the reopening of segments of the economy that depend heavily on face-to-face interaction. Government programs, including enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks delivered directly to lower-income earners, have supported consumer spending.\\nFor the euro area, our forecast for 2021 growth of around 5% is unchanged. A halting start to vaccination rollouts and repeated lockdowns tipped the bloc back into recession early this year, but supportive policy, an easing of travel restrictions, and consumption that remains 10% below its pre-pandemic trend could underpin a strong bounce-back.\\nFor China, we have lowered our 2021 forecast to around 8.5%. The country has largely contained the pandemic and was the first to return to its pre-COVID GDP level, but consumption is taking time to normalize amid slow vaccination rollouts and sporadic virus outbreaks. Domestic consumption may continue to lag even as vaccinations ramp up, but exports have boosted China's economy.\\nFor emerging markets, we have raised our forecast for 2021 to above 6%. A resurgence of the virus, particularly in emerging Asia, weighed on growth in the first half of this year, but growth should accelerate as vaccination efforts advance.\\nHow faster growth could affect inflation and monetary policy\\nVarious factors are fanning concerns about higher inflation, including the stronger-than-expected rebound in global growth, extraordinary and unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus, and a jump in demand for goods and services as economies reopen and supply gradually comes back online. Although we expect the effects to be largely transitory, our outlook is for a modest but eventually persistent increase in inflation.\\nImproving economies and somewhat higher inflation are, in turn, spurring questions about monetary policy. Some central banks have already begun slowing the pace of asset purchases put in place at the start of the pandemic, and others are contemplating doing so. Such moves constitute a gradual removal of accommodative monetary policy. We nevertheless expect that initial increases in central bank short-term rates won't occur broadly before 2023.\\nU.S. inflation risks are higher than those in other countries given some supply-and-demand imbalances. Diminished supply of goods, including new and used cars, and of labor, amid demand rebounds in some sectors, might take time to unwind. Our baseline scenario, shown in the chart below, is that core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy prices) will persist above the Federal Reserve's 2% target in the second half of 2021 before moderating in 2022.\\nThere is a risk, however, that significantly more fiscal spending on the order of $2 trillion to $3 trillion—our “go big” scenario in the chart below—could lead inflation to significantly overshoot the Fed's target later this year and into 2022. Such a development could affect inflation psychology, in which higher expected inflation can lead to higher actual inflation.\\nInflation: Up, up … but not away in 2021\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from January 1995 through April 2021 from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nWith its 2020 adoption of “average inflation targeting,” which makes 2% a longer-term goal rather than an upper limit, the Fed may be more comfortable letting inflation run reasonably above 2% for some time. We foresee accommodative policy persisting for the rest of 2021, though plans for reducing the pace of asset purchases are likely to be disclosed in the second half. We currently don’t foresee conditions meeting the Fed’s rate-hike criteria of price stability and maximum sustainable employment until the second half of 2023.\\nHeadline inflation, as shown in the chart below, is likely to follow similar paths in the euro area and the United Kingdom. Euro-area energy prices are likely to push headline inflation above 2% in the second half of 2021, but underlying price pressures remain subdued. We foresee core inflation rising to a range of 1% to 1.5% by year-end, slightly higher than our view when 2021 began. The European Central Bank is likely to keep interest rates on hold at least through 2022, even as the economy improves, though it will probably slow its pace of asset purchases in the near term.\\nHeadline inflation in the euro area and U.K. is likely to moderate in 2022\\nSources: Vanguard, based on data from January 2019 through May 2021 from the UK Office for National Statistics and Eurostat.\\n\\nWe continue to foresee core inflation in China of around 1.5% for 2021, well below the People's Bank of China's 3% target. Although producer prices have climbed, we expect pass-through effects to remain limited, especially amid modest consumer demand. We expect monetary policy to continue to normalize, but only gradually as economic growth remains uneven.\\nInflation in emerging markets has been higher than expected. A disinflationary trend in parts of Asia has disappeared, and inflation in other regions has largely risen above its pre-pandemic pace as higher borrowing costs in developed markets spill over. Inflation dynamics and rising U.S. interest rates have constrained central banks' accommodative bias even as economic growth remains below potential. Recent rate hikes in Brazil, Russia, and Turkey amid rising inflation demonstrate the challenge.\\nWhere our 10-year return forecasts stand\\nStarting valuations matter. Global stocks this year have continued to rally from pandemic lows, and that will make further gains harder to come by. In fact, our 10-year annualized return forecasts for some developed markets are nearly 2 percentage points lower than they were at the end of 2020.\\nThe news is better for bond investors. Because we expect bond portfolios of all types and maturities to earn returns close to their current yield levels, the recent increase in market interest rates has led us to raise our 10-year annualized return forecasts by a half to a full percentage point for a number of markets.\\nOur forecasts, in local currencies, are derived from a May 31, 2021, running of the Vanguard Capital Markets Model®. The figures are based on a 1-point range around the 50th percentile of the distribution of return outcomes for equities and a 0.5-point range around the 50th percentile for bonds.\\nHere are our current 10-year annualized return forecasts:\\nU.S. stocks: 2.4% to 4.4%; Ex-U.S. stocks: 5.2% to 7.2%.\\nU.S. bonds: 1.4% to 2.4%; Ex-U.S. bonds: 1.3% to 2.3% when hedged in U.S. dollars.\\nEuro-area stocks: 2.9% to 4.9%; Ex-euro-area stocks: 1.6% to 3.6%.\\nEuro-area bonds: –0.5% to 0.5%; Ex-euro-area bonds: –0.5% to 0.5% when hedged in euros.\\nChinese stocks: 5.1% to 7.1%; Ex-China stocks: 3.6% to 5.6%.\\nChinese bonds: 2.8% to 3.8%.\\n\\xa0\\nIMPORTANT: The projections\\xa0and\\xa0other information generated by the VCMM regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results.

Results from the model may vary with each use and over time. For more information, please see important information below.\\nA final word about bonds and portfolios\\nEven with our upward revisions, returns from bonds in most markets are likely to be modest. We nonetheless still see their primary role in a portfolio as providing diversification from riskier assets rather than generating returns.\\nKeep in mind that return forecasts change in response to evolving assessments of economic and market conditions, but that doesn't mean your investment plan should change. In fact, long-term investors often have the best chance of investment success by staying the course if their investment plan is diversified across asset classes, sectors, and regions and is in line with their investment goals and tolerance for risk.\\nIn addition, for clients concerned about the impact of shifting market conditions on their retirement portfolios, consider sharing this recent piece that explains how a dynamic spending plan can have a dampening effect on portfolio volatility.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Herd immunity is the point at which a virus’ spread becomes harder because numbers of vaccinated and already-infected people have reached a certain threshold.\\n\\xa0Important information\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account.\\nThere is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.\\nInvestments in stocks or bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk. These risks are especially high in emerging markets.\\nBond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time, and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments.\\nAbout the Vanguard Capital Markets Model:\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. VCMM results will vary with each use and over time.\\nThe VCMM projections are based on a statistical analysis of historical data. Future returns may behave differently from the historical patterns captured in the VCMM. More important, the VCMM may be underestimating extreme negative scenarios unobserved in the historical period on which the model estimation is based.\\nThe Vanguard Capital Markets Model® is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk (beta). At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to project the estimated interrelationships among risk factors and asset classes as well as uncertainty and randomness over time.

       "  'content': 'Our factor ETFs recently celebrated their three-year anniversary. Crossing this threshold provided a great opportunity to check in with Antonio Picca, head of Vanguard Factor-Based Strategies, about the current state of our lineup, the market environment, and strategies to implement factor-based investing in your portfolio construction approach.\\nVanguard factor ETFs recently hit their three-year mark. Now that they have achieved this milestone, can you provide some thoughts and insights into the first three years for Vanguard\\'s first actively managed ETFs?\\nIt has been a wild ride! Who could have predicted a pandemic-fueled rally happening at the top of the longest bull run in the history of the U.S. stock market? In this environment, our factor ETFs experienced some of the largest movements ever observed in 90+ years of historical data. This is partly the result of our design choices.\\nWhen designing the funds, we made the deliberate choice of targeting factors across the capitalization spectrum. Each portfolio is split evenly across large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks because we believe that gives them the best potential for outperformance over the long term. Factor premiums can show up at different times and in different parts of the market-cap spectrum, so it\\'s important to be diversified across the whole spectrum in order to capture the premium when it\\'s there.\\nThis decision turned out to be a major headwind in the first couple of years, with the market driven exclusively by a small group of mega-cap growth stocks. We were forced to face tough questions such as \"Are factors broken?\" and \"Does your approach make sense in a winner-takes-all economy?\" There was no simple answer to these tough questions. However, what kept us optimistic was the observation that similar dynamics happened in the late \\'90s and early \\'70s, coinciding with the second- and third-longest bull runs in the U.S. market\\'s history.\\nOur optimism was finally validated last year, when the COVID shock changed the market narrative and factors started delivering stronger performance across the capitalization spectrum. As you can see from the chart below, the early days of our factor products saw a handful of large-cap growth stocks driving market performance. While the COVID shock made this trend even more pronounced, we are beginning to see a strong comeback in value and small-cap stocks as the country emerges from the pandemic.\\nA changing market narrative leads to stronger factor performance across the capitalization spectrum\\nSource: FactSet, based on data from February 13, 2018, through May 25, 2021. For standardized performance for VFVA click here.\\nThe performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, so investors’ shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data cited. For performance data current to the most recent month end, visit our website at vanguard.com/performance. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\nWe\\'ve recently seen a market environment that has been more favorable to small-cap and value stocks. Why are our factor ETFs uniquely positioned to take advantage of this current market trend?\\nSo far value stocks have been the protagonists of the economic recovery. Their performance really shined once there was positive news about the efficacy of the COVID vaccines and a strong economic stimulus. This fell perfectly in line with our expectations since value stocks are pro-cyclical and tend to do their best during periods of economic recovery.\\nThe small-cap performance reflects the broadening market leadership of stocks that were previously ignored by investors but are getting a second chance. This is key when evaluating how our factors may perform going forward. The dichotomy between growth and value is so ingrained into the common narrative that most people tend to think that we are going from a lopsided market obsessed with a small group of high-flying technology and media companies, to one dominated by small-cap energy and financial companies.\\nAs this obsession for growth wanes, it creates opportunities for other companies across the capitalization spectrum and across factors. All of our factors (value, quality, momentum, liquidity, multifactor, and minimum volatility) are well positioned to benefit from this, not just our value product. Even our momentum strategy is positioned to take advantage as our active implementation approach has allowed us to quickly transition from a growth play through most of 2020 to a value/broader play in early 2021.\\nIf you don\\'t believe me, just look at their valuations! Despite the recent performance rebound, our factors are still trading at historically low valuations compared with the broad equity market. This means that there is still the potential to outperform over the next 3, 5, and 10 years. Value, for example, would need to outperform the Russell 3000 Index by 35% to get back in line with its average historical valuation relative to the market.\\nMarket factors trading at historically low valuations versus the broad market\\nSource: Refinitiv Financial Solutions, based on data through May 31, 2021.\\n\\xa0\\nMethodology: Relative valuations are computed as the price to forward-earnings of the factor portfolios divided by the price to forward-earnings of the Russell 3000 Index. The price to forward-earnings ratio is computed as the weighted average of the stocks’ market capitalization divided by the weighted average of their 12-month forward earnings from I/B/E/S (Institutional Brokers Estimate System). The weights used in the average correspond to the factor portfolios and Russell 3000 weights, respectively. The 12-month forward earnings from I/B/E/S are weighted at 2.5% and 97.5% of the Russell 3000 universe.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\n\\nRelative valuations versus the Russell 3000 Index\\nSource: Refinitiv Financial Solutions, based on data through May 31, 2021.\\n\\xa0\\nMethodology: Relative valuations are computed as the price to forward-earnings of the factor portfolios divided by the price to forward-earnings of the Russell 3000 Index.

But I think that factor-based ETFs will continue to garner assets from traditional forms of active management and even from broad-market investing going forward.\\nCan you provide some examples of how you’ve seen advisors implementing our factor ETFs into their portfolio construction approach?\\nOver the last three years, we\\'ve worked with many advisors helping them incorporate factors into their clients\\' portfolios. We\\'re still seeing a large dispersion in factor knowledge across the investor spectrum. Those who are further along their factor journey have generally a strong idea about which factors they wish to target and how they can be used strategically (as a large percentage of their allocation intended to be held for a long time horizon) or tactically (leaning into a factor more aggressively based on its valuation or momentum with perhaps a shorter-term horizon).\\nOur Portfolio and Analytics team has also worked with investors who aren\\'t as familiar with factors yet want to substitute current active manager allocations with a lower-cost factor portfolio. Many fall somewhere in between. These folks generally combine many factors together and use a multifactor approach as the satellite of their allocation.\\xa0\\nCheck out our factor ETF lineup\\nCustomize clients’ tilts toward the factors that influence portfolio performance\\nU.S. Value Factor ETF\\xa0 (VFVA)\\nU.S. Quality Factor ETF (VFQY)\\nU.S. Liquidity Factor ETF (VFLQ)\\nU.S. Momentum Factor ETF (VFMO)\\nU.S. Multifactor ETF (VFMF)\\nU.S. Minimum Volatility ETF (VFMV)\\n\\xa0Notes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs, obtain a prospectus (or a summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-523-1036 to request one.

Most of our managers consider these factors even for products without an explicit ESG investment strategy. The industry regularly refers to this approach as ESG integration, and it is used in both fixed income and equity investing.\\nWe regularly assess how our external managers use ESG factors to inform their investment decisions and how their approaches evolve over time. We review how they gather ESG information, whether they employ dedicated analysts, and how they interact with those analysts. Our fund managers recognize that assessing material ESG risks is a competitive advantage for driving excess return.\\nOur actively managed Vanguard Global ESG Select Stock Fund Admiral Shares (VESGX) employs an ESG integration strategy and invests only in companies that meet the advisor’s ESG criteria.\\nWe engage with the portfolio companies in our index funds\\nThe Vanguard Investment Stewardship team continuously engages with the companies in which our index funds invest to better understand how they are addressing material ESG risks given that these risks may undermine returns over the long run.\\nSome firms respond to our stewardship activities, adopt best practices, and demonstrate clear and measurable progress toward risk reduction. Other companies are less proactive in mitigating material risks. But since an index fund must hold all, or a representative sample, of the companies in its benchmark index, when a portfolio company fails to address a material risk, we use investment stewardship activities, such as voting our funds' proxies, to further encourage action to preserve shareholder value.\\nContinuously evaluating the ESG landscape\\nWe believe that, if left unchecked, ESG risks can undermine a company's future long-term value. Additionally, we believe that, over time, well-governed companies that mitigate material risks will outperform those that are poorly governed. That said, there is no right style of ESG investing, and the landscape continues to develop rapidly. As such, we plan to continuously evaluate ESG opportunities for both index providers and active managers.\\nThe most important consideration is selecting an approach that is unique to each of your clients. And you should never sacrifice the tenets of diversification and low cost in constructing a portfolio that aligns with your clients’ ESG investing goals.\\nNotes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs,\\xa0obtain a prospectus\\xa0(or a summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-523-1036 to request one.

       "  'content': 'The COVID-19 pandemic made it abundantly clear that central banks had the tools, and were willing to use them, to counter a dramatic fall-off in global economic activity. That economies and financial markets were able to find their footing so quickly after a few downright scary months in 2020 was in no small part because of monetary policy that kept bond markets liquid and borrowing terms super-easy.\\nNow, as newly vaccinated individuals unleash their pent-up demand for goods and services on supplies that may initially struggle to keep up, questions naturally arise about resurgent inflation and interest rates, and what central banks will do next.\\nVanguard\\'s global chief economist, Joe Davis, recently wrote how the coming rises in inflation are unlikely to spiral out of control and can support a more promising environment for long-term portfolio returns. Similarly, in new research on the unwinding of loose monetary policy, we find that central bank policy rates and interest rates more broadly are likely to rise, but only modestly, in the next several years.Prepare for policy rate lift-off … but not immediately\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nLift-off date\\n\\n\\n2025\\n\\n\\n2030\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. Federal Reserve\\n\\n\\nQ3 2023\\n\\n\\n1.25%\\n\\n\\n2.50%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBank of England\\n\\n\\nQ1 2023\\n\\n\\n1.25%\\n\\n\\n2.50%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEuropean Central Bank\\n\\n\\nQ4 2023\\n\\n\\n0.60%\\n\\n\\n1.50%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes: Lift-off date is the projected date of increase in the short-term policy interest rate target for each central bank from its current low. Rates for 2025 and 2030 are Vanguard projections for each central bank’s policy rate.\\nSource: Vanguard forecasts as of May 13, 2021.Our view that lift-off from current low policy rates may occur in some cases only two years from now reflects, among other things, an only gradual recovery from the pandemic’s significant effect on labor markets. (My colleagues Andrew Patterson and Adam Schickling wrote recently about how prospects for inflation and labor market recovery will allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to be patient when considering when to raise its target for the benchmark federal funds rate.)\\nAlongside rises in policy rates, Vanguard expects central banks, in our base-case \"reflation\" scenario, to slow and eventually stop their purchases of government bonds, allowing the size of their balance sheets as a percentage of GDP to fall back toward pre-pandemic levels. This reversal in bond-purchase programs will likely put some upward pressure on yields.\\nWe expect balance sheets to remain large relative to history, however, because of structural factors, such as a change in how central banks have conducted monetary policy since the 2008 global financial crisis and stricter capital and liquidity requirements on banks. Given these changes, we don\\'t expect shrinking central bank balance sheets to place meaningful upward pressure on yields. Indeed, we expect higher policy rates and smaller central bank balance sheets to cause only a modest lift in yields. And we expect that, through the remainder of the 2020s, bond yields will be lower than they were before the global financial crisis.\\nThree scenarios for 10-year bond yields\\nSources: Historical government bond yield data sourced from Bloomberg. Vanguard forecasts, as of May 13, 2021, generated from Vanguard’s proprietary vector error correction model.\\n\\nWe expect yields to rise more in the United States than in the United Kingdom or the euro area because of a greater expected reduction in the Fed\\'s balance sheet compared with that of the Bank of England or the European Central Bank, and a Fed policy rate rising as high or higher than the others\\'.\\nOur base-case forecasts for 10-year government bond yields at decade’s end reflect monetary policy that we expect will have reached an equilibrium—policy that is neither accommodative nor restrictive. From there, we anticipate that central banks will use their tools to make borrowing terms easier or tighter as appropriate.\\nThe transition from a low-yield to a moderately higher-yield environment can bring some initial pain through capital losses within a portfolio. But these losses can eventually be offset by a greater income stream as new bonds purchased at higher yields enter the portfolio.

       "  'content': \"Over the last 10 years, U.S. growth stocks outperformed U.S. value stocks by an average of 7.8% per year.1 Powered by a relentless rise in technology share prices, growth stocks have handily outpaced value since the 2008 global financial crisis. Simply put, growth has historically never outperformed value as it has over this past decade.\\nAre we seeing a reversal of fortune with the value premium asserting itself once again? Will your clients' asset allocation strategies be positioned to take advantage of this shift?\\nVanguard's latest research suggests that there is a fundamental explanation for some of value stocks' recent woes, such as the inflation and growth environment, but that the narrative has been oversold. Based on our fair-value model, we expect value to outperform growth over the next 10-year period by as much as 5% to 7% per year and perhaps by even more over the next five years.\\nThe unprecedented recent outperformance of growth over value\\nSource: Fama-French research returns, outlined at http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html#Research.\\nNotes: The chart displays annualized 10-year trailing returns of a long-short value versus growth portfolio over the period from June 1936 to January 2021 constructed using Fama-French methodology, available at https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/f-f_5_factors_2x3.html. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.\\n1 Value and growth are represented by a market-capitalization-weighted index of companies in the bottom and top thirds of the Russell 1000 Index, sorted by price/book ratios and reconstituted monthly. Data are as of February 28, 2021.\\n\\nSecular trends are driving fair values, but the market may have overreacted\\nOur model suggests that value stocks’ underperformance in recent years owes mainly to fundamental drivers, notably, low inflation rates, which boosted the relative attractiveness of growth stocks' more distant cash flows. But investor behavior played a role as well.\\nThe model highlights some key points about our fair-value estimates:\\n\\nThe decline in the fair value of value/growth has more to do with a large increase in the fair value of growth/market than with a large decrease in that of value/market.\\nValue stocks are much more sensitive to cyclical drivers such as market volatility and corporate profits than are growth stocks.\\nGrowth and value appear to be at the upper and lower bounds of their respective fair value to market estimates.\\n\\nValue stock price/book ratio divided by growth stock price/book ratio\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from FactSet, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Reserve Board, Thomson Reuters, and Global Financial Data.\\nNote: The statistical model specification is a seven-variable vector error correction (VEC) that includes the following variables: prior-period ratio of price/book, 10-year trailing inflation, 10-year real U.S. Treasury yield, equity volatility, growth of corporate profits, and ratio of R&D expense/book value estimated over the period from January 1979 to February 2021.\\n\\nValue signaling a resurgence\\nWe believe that cyclical value-growth rotations are rooted in investor behavior and that investors become more price-conscious when profit growth is strong. Since 2008, corporate profit growth has been insufficient to sustain value stocks.\\nAs inflation normalizes, we expect it to eventually exceed the Federal Reserve's target. Improved performance from the energy, materials, and financial sectors may be signaling a resurgence in these beaten-down value-oriented segments. However, the ultimate driver of the predicted rotation to value stocks is apt to be a change in investors' appetite for risk.\\nOur research found that deviations from fair value and future relative returns share an inverse and statistically significant relationship over the next 5- and 10-year periods. The relationship is an affirmation that, ultimately, valuations matter—that the price we pay influences our return.\\nThe drivers of value outperformance over the next 5- and 10-year periods\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from FactSet.\\nNotes: Returns are calculated based on a modeled reversion to fair value and a projection of the fair-value ratio of value/growth price/book. Total return in panel c is the sum of the return components in panels a and b at each percentile. Note that numbers may differ slightly because of rounding.\\n\\nEventually, we believe that value will take the lead again, as it did through most of the first decade of this millennium. For investors with sufficient risk tolerance, time horizons, and patience, an overweight to value stocks could help offset the lower broad-market returns we expect over the next decade.\"},\n",

We've been able to achieve returns that are excess of the benchmark through a varied market environment. When markets are rallying or selling off, the fund's been able to beat its benchmark.

The fund has generated alpha not just strongly but also consistently, and that's something that we're most proud of.\\nBrian: You couldn't ask for a better litmus test than 2020. An active manager needs to be patient, nimble, and disciplined, and I thought we exhibited all three of those traits in 2020.\\nDaniel: Going into the year, we took a more defensive stance in credits, observing the tight levels of credit spreads and the inability of those spreads to cushion against market risks. By January and February, as the rest of the world was taking comfort in the resilience of U.S. equity indices, we were looking at the impact of the virus in Asia and reducing exposure to more growth-sensitive sectors.\\nBrian: When the pandemic hit U.S. shores and risk assets cheapened dramatically, we were in a perfect position to take full advantage. We were able to use the liquidity that we had built earlier to rotate back into those riskier sectors at significantly more attractive levels.\\nArvind: This allowed us to really outperform the benchmarks through the year, and we were able to generate a lot of performance through the second half of the year.

       "  'content': \"Clients don't always have the luxury of choosing to retire as financial markets are rising. Yet, the timing of clients' transition out of the working world can have a tremendous impact on their retirement savings longevity.\\nAs Vanguard research has shown, sequence-of-return risk—the threat to a successful retirement posed by a concentrated run of poor market performance—can be substantial, especially if it happens early in retirement. This risk can mean lower-than-hoped-for retirement income, early exhaustion of retirement savings principal, or both.\\nFortunately, you and your clients can leverage much more than lucky timing to boost their chances of a financially comfortable retirement. Small adjustments to retirement spending, guided by actual market conditions, can go a long way toward boosting the probability of long-term retirement success (that is, spending that's sustainable for life, while affording the client a satisfactory lifestyle). This article examines the dynamic spending strategy for sustaining retirement savings and provides resources to deepen your and your clients' understanding of this important concept.\\nSpending in a market decline—the issues\\nIdeally, no one wants to enter retirement during a prolonged and significant market decline. After all, a market shock reduces a client portfolio's value, diminishing the amount that can safely be withdrawn. But it's not entirely bad news: By lowering the valuations of securities, the shock can also raise expected returns, potentially offsetting some of this decline. A decline in stock market valuations has tended to be associated with higher future returns.1\\nIn a series of Vanguard Capital Markets Model® (VCMM) simulations, this rise in expected returns meant that the decline in sustainable spending was shallower than the decline in the portfolio's value. At the end of December 2019, VCMM projections suggested that a $1 million portfolio could sustain $45,000 in annual spending, adjusted for inflation (dollar plus inflation rule), for 30 years. In 10,000 simulations, the portfolio met this target 85% of the time. After the market shock, the $1 million portfolio fell to $800,000, a 20% decline. However, as expected returns rose, sustainable spending dropped by less than 10%, to $40,800.2\\nIn simple terms, a comparatively small reduction—by percentage—in annual spending can preserve a portfolio after it's been hit by a much larger market shock.\\nFigure 1. Sustainable spending in times of crisis\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the VCMM regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. Distribution of return outcomes from VCMM are derived from 10,000 simulations for each modeled asset class. Simulations as of December 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020. Results from the model may vary with each use and over time. For more information, please see the disclosure at the end of this article.\\nNotes: The results assume an 85% success rate over a 30-year time horizon. The time horizon precrisis is 30 years after December 2019. The time horizon postcrisis is 30 years after March 2020. The ceiling is 5% and the floor is –1.5%. The asset allocation is domestic equity 30%, international equity 20%, domestic fixed income 35%, and international fixed income 15%. U.S. equities represented by the MSCI US Broad Market Index; global ex-U.S. equities represented by MSCI All Country World ex USA Index; U.S. bonds represented by Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index; global ex-U.S. bonds represented by Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate ex-USD Index, using data as of December 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020. Forecast corresponds to distribution of 10,000 VCMM simulations for 30-year annualized nominal returns as of December 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020, in USD.\\n\\nFurther, Figure 1, above, shows that substantially higher annual spending is possible through a flexible approach, calibrated yearly to market conditions (dynamic spending rule).\\nTo help clients in adopting such an approach, it's first helpful to summarize three of the most common spending strategies (Figure 2):\\n\\nDollar plus inflation—The retiree determines a set amount to spend and adds the cost of inflation annually.\\nDynamic spending—The retiree adjusts spending each year to adapt to market conditions. They set a ceiling and floor for how much to take from their portfolio (for instance, 5% greater than the previous year’s spending in exceptional market conditions or 1.5% less than the previous year in a poor market).\\nPercentage of portfolio—The retiree determines a set percentage to spend each year, no matter the size of their portfolio.\\n\\nFigure 2. Comparing spending rules\\n\\nOf the three, dynamic spending offers an appealing combination of overall versatility, flexibility, and stability—allowing retirees to spend more in bull markets while having to cut back only slightly in down markets.\\nDynamic spending also increases the probability of success throughout a wide range of market conditions and at different target spending levels, as demonstrated in the VCMM simulation (Figures 3 and 4). For instance, with a $40,000 spending target, the base case success rate—after a crisis reduced the portfolio to $800,000—was 97.8% using a dynamic spending strategy, versus 88.6% using the dollar plus inflation spending strategy (assuming a time horizon of 30 years after March 2020).\\nFigure 3. Probability of success in times of crisis with $50,000 spending target\\n\\n\\nFigure 4. Probability of success in times of crisis with $40,000 spending target\\nIMPORTANT: The projections and other information generated by the VCMM regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results.

Further, a dynamic spending strategy provides retirees the flexibility to spend more in good market conditions while they only have to cut back a little when markets retreat.\\nNote that the calculations here exclude Social Security and other possible income, such as pensions, rental property, or supplemental employment after retirement. Such income streams can enhance the chances of individuals successfully maintaining their portfolio through the end of retirement.\\nAs a financial advisor, you're uniquely situated to help clients understand sequence-of-return risk, and how implementing a dynamic spending strategy can mitigate that risk. You can also remind them that bearish markets are inevitable. While it's impossible to accurately predict when downturns will appear, with your help, clients can take steps ahead of time to minimize the long-term impact on their retirement.\\nConsult the resources below to explore this topic in greater depth.\"},\n",

Here are five lessons to share with your clients.\\nDevelop a financial game plan\\nFirst, establish clear, attainable goals and create a plan that will help you reach them. Be conservative in your projections about how fast your money will grow. By avoiding impractical saving or spending requirements, you can help keep your plan on track.\\nBecome a disciplined saver\\nFour key words for building a secure financial future are \"live below your means.\" Make a habit of putting money away. If saving money doesn\\'t come naturally to you, find creative ways to make it a fun challenge. Consider what changes you\\'re willing to make to set aside a little more for your future.\\nInvest with balance and diversification\\nCreate a sound investment strategy by choosing an asset allocation that uses broadly diversified funds and considers your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.\\nControl your costs\\nWhile you can\\'t control the markets, you can control your investment costs and taxes. The less you pay for funds, the greater your share of the investments\\' potential returns. Be sure to avoid funds with high expense ratios. The average Vanguard mutual fund and ETF expense ratio is 83% less than the industry average.*\\nTo minimize taxes, consider tax-efficient investments like index mutual funds and ETFs. IRAs are another way to mitigate the impact of taxes.**\\nMaintain a long-term perspective\\nOver time, you’ll experience both good and challenging times that can evoke various emotions.

       "  'content': \"The yield of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose more than 100 basis points (1 percentage point) from August 2020 through late March 2021. Rates also climbed for other government bonds, including those issued by the United Kingdom and Australia. Because bond prices fall as rates rise, and vice versa, some investors are feeling jittery about the near-term risks of bonds.\\nRising bond yields mean lower bond prices\\nDaily yield of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, January 2, 2020–March 22, 2021\\nSource: U.S. Department of the Treasury.\\n\\nBond investors should hold, not fold\\nIn such market cycles, it's particularly important to keep in mind the role bonds play in a diversified investment portfolio—to be a shock absorber at times when equity prices head downward.\\nVanguard research found that when stocks worldwide sank an average of roughly 34% during the global financial crisis, the market for investment-grade bonds returned more than 8%. Similarly, from January through March 2020—the period encompassing the height of volatility in equities due to the COVID-19 pandemic—bonds worldwide returned just over 1% while equities fell by almost 16%. And if we look at the markets over several full business cycles, from January 1988 through November 2020, whenever monthly equity returns were down, monthly bond returns remained positive about 71% of the time.1 \\nSuch uncorrelated returns demonstrate the diversification benefits that a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds offers investors.\\nIn short, don't let changes in interest rates drive a strategic shift in your bond allocation. Myths and misconceptions regarding bond investing abound during periods of rising rates, often coupled with calls for drastic changes to your portfolio. Here are three common myths that investors should avoid:\\nMyth #1: Bonds are a bad idea—abandon the 60/40 portfolio.\\nThis oft-heard recommendation contradicts the overriding importance of maintaining a balanced allocation that suits your investment objectives, plus it may be too late to gain any benefit from a tactical shift in your asset allocation. Selling bonds after the recent increase in rates, which has driven down prices and total returns, is simply chasing past performance. Investors should stay forward-looking: At current higher yields, the outlook for bonds is actually better than before yields went up. Bear in mind that the upside of higher yields—greater interest income—is coming. Also, the odds of future capital losses decline as yields increase. So now is not the time to abandon bond allocations. On the contrary, the more that bond yields rise (and prices fall), the more important it is for long-term investors to maintain a strategic allocation to bonds, which could require rebalancing into bonds, not the other way around.\\nMyth #2: Go to cash—avoid duration risk.\\nRising rates have hit long-term bonds the hardest. But the recommendation to avoid duration or interest rate risk is backward-looking and probably comes too late. Again, shift your mindset to a forward-looking view of the bond market. The market consensus is that rates will rise, and the prices of short-, intermediate-, and long-term issues already reflect that belief. Today's market prices for longer-term bonds already factor in investors' expectations for rising rates, which is why prices are cheaper. If that consensus view were to play out, there would be no advantage in shifting to shorter-term bonds or going to cash. Such moves would pay off only if longer-term yields were to rise more than expected. However, it's equally likely that yields will rise less than expected, in which case long-term bonds would do better.\\nMyth #3: When interest rates are rising, don't just stand there—do something!\\nThe past stretch of rising rates was a surprise to the markets, but now markets expect continued increases. That rates are rising is not really news anymore. While yields indeed seem likely to rise, they may do so by either more or less than the market consensus. Control what you can: With a 50-50 chance of rates rising more or less than consensus, a better approach than trying to pick which market segments will fare best in the near term is to stay well-diversified for the long term across the maturity spectrum and across asset classes.\\nKeep your eyes on the road ahead\\nIt's good advice in both driving and investing. Vanguard recommends that investors stay focused on long-term, forward-looking return expectations, not on recent trailing-return performance.\\nLet your investment goals shape decisions about your strategic asset allocation. Calibrate the risk–return trade-off in your portfolio accordingly, including setting the right mix of bonds and stocks to meet those goals. And generally ignore market-timing advice, which is mostly based on public consensus information that is already priced into the markets.\\nEven if rates keep rising, long-term total returns on broadly diversified bond portfolios are likely to remain positive. That would be the natural outcome of reinvesting bond dividends at higher yields, a process that’s easily managed by owning mutual funds or ETFs.\\nThe elephant in the room—inflation\\nInflation is often seen as the enemy of the fixed income investor—in particular, unexpected inflation that the market hasn't priced in. Inflation-indexed securities provide a limited hedge against unexpected inflation.\\nVanguard research suggests that significant inflation hedging through inflation-linked securities requires large positions, which could reduce the other diversification benefits of a bond allocation in a portfolio. Over long time horizons, equities historically have provided the strongest safeguard against inflation.2\\nWhere active can shine\\nA rising rate environment also accentuates what skilled active managers may be able to bring to a bond portfolio. When yields are falling, outperforming fund managers pile their excess returns on top of the market’s generally rising prices. But amid the headwinds of rising rates and prevailing price declines, successful active fund managers may make the difference between positive and negative total returns.\\nInvestors who are inclined to seek outperformance—and are cognizant of the risk of underperformance—should leave decisions about tactical shifts and security selection to professional active managers. Those managers who have shown skill in executing repeatable investment processes, subject to strict investment risk controls—like my colleagues in Vanguard Fixed Income Group—can guide portfolios successfully through market waters, tranquil and choppy alike.3\"},\n",

Its dual mandate is to steer the U.S. economy to both price stability and maximum sustainable employment. How the Fed uses its discretion in achieving these goals, as well as in defining them, is at the heart of its policy decisions—and it's why Vanguard believes the Fed is unlikely to raise rates in the near term.\\nThe Fed has outlined changes to its monetary policy framework that give us confidence that it won't raise its benchmark federal funds rate target until at least 2023, even as stimulus payments flow through the economy and stock markets remain near record highs. On Wednesday, March 17, the Fed reaffirmed that it would keep monetary policy accommodative for the foreseeable future to support economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. It said it would keep its rate target near zero and continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities by a total of at least $120 billion per month for now.\\nIn this Q&A, Vanguard economists Andrew Patterson and Adam Schickling discuss the conditions driving the Fed's decision-making, including its 2020 move to an average inflation target and Chairman Jerome Powell's view that maximum sustainable employment means people in historically hard-to-reach pockets of the labor market getting back to work.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The tremendous surge in the price of cryptocurrencies has attracted the attention of many investors, who may be considering the digital currency as a potential substitute for traditional asset classes in diversified portfolios. But Roger Aliaga-Díaz, chief economist for the Americas and head of portfolio construction at Vanguard, cautioned against speculating in cryptocurrencies, which are largely unregulated and accompanied by considerable risks.\\n\"Cryptocurrency prices depend mostly on speculation about their adoption and use,\" Aliaga-Díaz said. \"And that speculation creates volatility that, ironically, undermines their potential use as either a currency or asset class in an investment strategy.\"\\nWhat is a cryptocurrency?\\nA cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual means of exchange. There are more than 6,700 cryptocurrencies today; among the better known are Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, and Litecoin.\\nUnlike traditional currencies, virtual currencies currently operate without central authorities or banks, and they are not backed by any government. Cryptocurrencies are stored in \"digital wallets\" on a holder\\'s computer or phone, or in the cloud. The wallet serves as a virtual bank account that enables holders to pay for goods and services or simply store the currency in hopes of an increase in value.\\nCryptocurrencies defy neat categorization. They are not a traditional currency, commodity, or asset class, though they share characteristics of each.\\nThere are several reasons why cryptocurrencies are not a traditional currency. Although some merchants have begun to allow cryptocurrency payments, they are generally not accepted as a medium of payment. Cryptocurrencies also are not used as a unit of account because prices, trade invoicing, and contracts are not quoted in digital currency units. Finally, cryptocurrencies\\' ability to serve as a store of value—a safe instrument to preserve the value of people’s financial wealth—is severely limited by their notorious volatility.\\n\"The fact that cryptocurrencies are not issued by a central bank is actually the very reason why they can\\'t achieve the quality of other well-accepted currencies,\" Aliaga-Díaz explained. \"The role of a central bank is precisely to preserve the value of the currency by keeping inflation under control. That\\'s why prices are more predictable under Federal Reserve management of the U.S. dollar money supply.\"\\nCryptocurrencies share some characteristics of commodities. For example, they can be bought and sold in cash markets or via derivatives. But Aliaga-Díaz said they are not commodities because they are not physical raw materials.\\nNo substitute for stock and bonds\\nSome wonder whether cryptocurrencies can be used in strategic portfolios as substitutes for stocks and bonds. \"But unlike traditional asset classes, cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic economic value and generate no cash flows, such as interest payments or dividends, which can explain their prices,\" Aliaga-Díaz said.\\nAliaga-Díaz pointed out that as with currencies and spot commodities, such as gold, there is no risk premium expected with cryptocurrencies as compensation for bearing the risk of their price movements. \"Because cryptos represent uncompensated risk to the portfolio, they are not a good substitute for stocks and bonds in a long-term portfolio,\" he said.\\nSome investors may be willing to bet on sustained crypto price increases based on the belief that crypto demand will always outpace its supply. And though there might be some valid reasons around projected demand and usage to make a compelling case for a persistent supply shortage that can sustain increasing prices, Aliaga-Díaz noted, the supply of cryptos has exploded over time, and there is no reason to believe that supply can\\'t keep up with demand.\\n\"The biggest risk for all investors would be to assume that demand growth will continue just because their prices have recently gone up,\" he said. \"That\\'s speculation, not investment.\"\\nOther risks to keep in mind\\nDespite all the recent attention devoted to cryptocurrencies, Aliaga-Díaz cautioned that there are a number of additional risks associated with digital currencies, including:\\n\\nLiquidity risk. Cryptocurrencies are unregulated, and no party is required to accept payments in virtual currency. As a result, certain market conditions might make it difficult or impossible to sell quickly at a reasonable price.\\nPricing risk. Cryptocurrencies trade in decentralized markets. In addition, cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms do not feature the regulations, controls, and investor protections available in traditional stock, options, and futures markets. For these reasons, there is no unifying single pricing mechanism that reflects digital currency values.\\nRegulatory risk. Cryptocurrencies essentially compete with currencies issued by governments. At some point, governments may seek to regulate or restrict cryptocurrencies, or issue a digital version of their own currencies. Such developments could adversely affect cryptocurrency prices.\\n\\n\"There is no enduring economic or investment rationale to expect cryptocurrencies to generate positive real returns,\" Aliaga-Díaz said. \"For investors, adding exposure to cryptocurrencies would mean reducing allocations to traditional asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a prudent, well-balanced investment program.\"'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Key takeaways\\n\\nThe substantial factor premia documented over long periods of time have been historically realized over a small number of periods when outsized positive returns appeared in clusters. Typically, in these periods, market leadership changed as a bull market transitioned to a bear market, or vice versa.\\nMaintaining a consistent factor exposure by having the flexibility to rebalance on a daily basis—instead of monthly or bi-annually like an indexed fund—would have delivered significantly higher factor premia, effectively doubling the historically observed premia in many cases. In particular, when daily rebalancing led to notable outperformances, the targeted factor\\'s composition changed at a significantly faster pace than in normal times.\\nOur findings indicate that harvesting factor premia to their maximal potential requires a skilled fund manager, who is dedicated and able to tell the right moments to aggressively rebalance from the other times.\\n\\nVanguard\\'s leading expert on factor investing, Antonio Picca and his team, recently researched the optimal rebalancing mechanism for long-only factor funds.\\nThe findings may surprise some as it shows that, based on the last 30 years of factor-investing performances, factor funds that maintained a consistent factor exposure by rebalancing more frequently—on a daily basis instead of monthly or biannually—achieved significantly higher factor premiums, effectively doubling the historically observed premiums of many factors.\\nWhat\\'s more, these findings indicate that to harvest factor premiums to their maximal potential, skill is needed on the part of the fund manager—an ability to tell the right moment to aggressively rebalance.\\nWe asked Antonio Picca four key questions about this body of research.\\nIs factor investing active or passive?\\nIt depends on who you ask. Gene Fama, for example, will tell you that factor investing is a purely passive endeavor. Whereas quantitative managers will tell you that it is a form of active investing. The truth is that factor investing straddles active and passive management.\\nEffective factor strategies seek to deliver a targeted factor exposure. To achieve this, they run a significant active risk against a market capitalization weighted benchmark, and frequently experience persistent out- or underperformances.\\nDespite this, people have grown to think of factor strategies as passive because the marketplace has been dominated by passive funds that are often anchored to a \"factor index\" that rebalances at most a few times in a given year. Beneath this passive façade, however, all factor funds are fundamentally active at their core.\\nUsing the analogy of thrill seeking adventures, we observe that factor investing is akin to surfing; a high-skill adventure. To achieve higher factor premia, factor investing requires active monitoring of the market environment, patience to wait until the wave of out-sized returns finally arrives, and most importantly, the ability to decisively catch the wave to ride it from start to finish.\\nBased on your research, what is the optimal rebalancing mechanism for long-only factor funds?\\nIn our research, we compared three portfolios tracking the same factor \"index\" but rebalancing at different frequencies: daily, monthly, and biannually. The daily-rebalanced portfolio maintained a consistent exposure to the factor, while the other portfolios experienced exposure decay like indexed factor funds.\\nWe found that maintaining a consistent exposure by rebalancing daily leads to much higher excess returns compared to portfolios that rebalance monthly or biannually. We also showed that the efficacy of daily rebalancing is highly time varying, and a significant amount of the outperformance was observed during periods of changing market leadership; when a bull market transitioned to a bear market or vice versa. This means that managers might not want to always rebalance daily, but having the flexibility to do so is a great advantage.\\nOur results are robust across factors with different levels of turnover: momentum, value, quality, and a multi-factor portfolio that equally weights the three aforementioned factors. Momentum is a fast-moving factor because it is affected by short-term returns. Quality, on the other side, only moves when companies report their financial statements. We chose these factors because they represent the set of factors that has become commonly available in the factor fund marketplace. In addition, all single factors we considered have undergone years of extensive research in the academic and practitioner literature. A process that consolidated insights into why the factor premium existed in the past and may persist into the future.\\nCan you share the data that supports your findings?\\nSure. The figure below illustrates the returns of four separate long-only portfolios: momentum, value, quality and multi-factor. The returns reflect conservative, transaction-cost assumptions that are doubled during high-volatility periods like the dot-com bubble bust and the global financial crisis (GFC).\\nFor each portfolio, we looked at the entire sample from January 1990 to August 2019, as well as three sub-periods covering the dot-com bubble, the GFC, and all other years that exclude the GFC and dot-com bubble. The excess returns created by daily rebalancing versus monthly rebalancing is noted in light blue. Whereas the excess returns created by daily rebalancing versus bi-annual rebalancing is noted in dark blue.\\nBy breaking the returns down in this way we can clearly see that maintaining a consistent factor exposure by having the flexibility to rebalance daily provides excess returns over nearly all periods when compared to a fixed monthly or bi-annual rebalancing.\\nThe most significant excess returns were created during the dot-com and GFC periods when the markets transitioned from one cycle to the next.\\nDaily rebalancing outperforms monthly and bi-annually rebalanced portfolios\\nD-M = Daily versus monthly rebalancing\\nD-B = Daily versus bi-annual rebalancing\\nMomentum\\n\\n\\nValue\\n\\n\\nQuality\\n\\n\\nMultifactor\\nSource: Vanguard. The portfolios were constructed using U.S. equity universe data underlying Axioma\\'s Risk Model AXUS4 (Axioma). This universe of securities largely overlaps with Russell 3000. The three single-factor portfolios were equally weighted the top 30% of securities by factor score as determined by Axioma. The multi-factor fund was constructed first by averaging the factor scores of momentum, value, and quality at the individual security level, which creates a cross section of composite multifactor scores. Based on this composite score, we then selected the top 30% of securities and equal weighted them. The portfolios tracked the same signal portfolio by rebalancing daily, monthly, and biannually, 30 bps per transaction volume for all trading; in addition, for extended periods with elevated volatility—notably around the dot-com bust (1999–2004) and the great financial crisis (2008–2009)—we double the trading cost assumption to 60 bps per transaction volume.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\nWhat portfolio manager characteristics should advisors look for when selecting factor funds?\\nThe concept of factors is simple. However, factor investing is not easy because factor returns can be quite volatile over short periods of time and can go through long stretches of underperformance. Successful factor managers should be able to maintain a strong and consistent factor exposure over time.\\nA strong factor exposure requires conviction and the willingness to run significant active risk against the market. Maintaining consistent exposure requires not only patience—to wait until the factor is in action—but also well-timed agility to follow the signal aggressively when the return environment does present itself.\\nGoing back to the surfing analogy, a skillful factor manager is like a master surfer who waits for the big wave. Even though it requires a whole lot of dedication, the surfer endures the passing of time patiently waiting for the big wave to appear. However, if and when the big wave does appear, how this surfer has prepared for this once-in-a-decade opportunity will be fully on display.\\nA well-prepared master surfer will ride the wave from start to finish, whereas others may wait on the side line for too long and catch only the tail end of the wave; a wave that may not return for another decade.Notes:\\n\\nFor more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs, obtain a prospectus (or summary prospectus, if available) or call 800-523-1036 to request one.

But our aim is to measure manager skill, independent of expenses beyond annual management fees. That’s why we calculate returns before any 12b-1 fees are deducted. Similarly, fund loads, or sales charges, aren’t included in our calculation of returns.\\nEach fund’s performance is measured against all of the other funds in its Refinitiv Lipper category, with a percentile ranking of 100 being the highest and 1 the lowest. This result is then weighted by asset size relative to the fund family’s other assets in its general classification. If a family’s biggest funds do well, that boosts its overall showing; poor performance in its biggest funds hurts a firm’s ranking.\\nTo be included in the ranking, a firm must have at least three funds in the general equity category, one world equity, one mixed equity (such as a balanced or target-date fund), two taxable bond funds, and one national tax-exempt bond fund.\\nSingle-sector and single-country equity funds are factored into the rankings as general equity. We exclude all passive index funds, including pure index, enhanced index, and index-based, but includes actively managed ETFs and so-called smart-beta ETFs, which are passively managed but created from active strategies.\\nFinally, the score is multiplied by the weighting of its general classification, as determined by the entire Lipper universe of funds. The category weightings for the one-year results in 2020 were general equity, 35.6%; mixed asset, 20.7%; world equity, 17.3%; taxable bond, 21.9%; and tax-exempt bond, 4.8%.\\nThe category weightings for the five-year results were general equity, 36.2%; mixed asset, 20.9%; world equity, 16.9%; taxable bond, 21.6%; and tax-exempt bond, 4.4%. For the 10-year list, they were general equity, 37.5%; mixed asset, 19.5%; world equity, 17.3%; taxable bond, 20.8%; and tax-exempt bond, 4.8%.\\nThe scoring: Say a fund in the general U.S. equity category has $500 million in assets, accounting for half of the firm’s assets in that category, and its performance lands it in the 75th percentile for the category. The first calculation would be 75 times 0.5, which comes to 37.5. This score is then multiplied by 35.6%, general equity’s overall weighting in Lipper’s universe, or 37.5 times 0.356, which equals 13.35. Similar calculations are done for each fund in our study. The numbers are added for each category and overall. The shop with the highest total score wins. The same process is repeated to determine the 5- and 10-year rankings.\\n1 Vanguard, as of December 31, 2020.\\n2 Vanguard and Morningstar, Inc., as of December 31, 2020.\\n3 The performance of Vanguard’s active funds relative to their peer-group averages follows: For the 10-year period, 7 of 7 Vanguard money market funds, 38 of 44 bond funds, 6 of 6 balanced funds, and 30 of 37 stock funds, or 81 of 94 Vanguard funds outperformed their peer-group averages.

       "  'content': 'With the proliferation of low-cost passive and factor-based products, how can advisors evaluate whether a particular active bond manager is worth the extra cost?\\nVanguard\\'s latest research paper answers this question with a systematic five-step process.\\n\"We tried to bridge the gap between theory and practical application,\" said Inna Zorina, senior investment strategist in Vanguard Investment Strategy Group and coauthor of Can active fixed income managers be cloned using style funds? A practical testing method. \"Our model used combinations of existing bond ETFs to simulate the performance of 625 actively managed U.S. fixed income funds that existed during the five years through 2019.\"\\nThe results indicated that while there are some active fixed income managers providing true alpha, there is a sizable portion who could be replicated with lower-fee passive style (i.e., factor) products. We asked the authors to apply the same methodology to one of Vanguard\\'s newer and popular active funds to see where it falls within this framework.\\nBut first, here are the findings of the overall study:\\nMore than one-fifth of active managers could have been cloned\\nThe chart below shows where the active managers landed in terms of net alpha relative to a proxy portfolio of ETFs that simulated their performance (horizontal axis) and tracking error relative to that proxy (vertical axis).\\nThose managers in the upper two quadrants had a tracking error greater than 1.5%, meaning that they were not easy to replicate with a proxy portfolio, while those in the upper- and lower-right quadrants added alpha that exceeded the average weighted expense ratio for the proxy portfolios. The left two quadrants are where active managers do not want to land, as these managers underperformed the proxies.\\nAlpha and replicability of active bond funds\\nNote: The chart illustrates individual U.S.-domiciled funds investing in U.S. fixed income. The tracking error and alpha values are calculated versus the given manager\\'s factor-mimicking portfolio. The factors used in the analysis included the total U.S. market, high-yield credit, and ultrashort Treasuries acting as a cash term. Average cost of cloning is estimated to be 20 basis points (0.20%), which represents the weighted expense ratio of the factor proxy products of an average factor-mimicking portfolio. Alpha could result from model misspecification (such as a suboptimal choice of factor proxies or omitted factors). Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.\\nSource: Can active fixed income managers be cloned using style funds? A practical testing method. Vanguard calculations using monthly gross return data from Morningstar for the five years through December 31, 2019.\\n\\n\"Roughly 22% of the funds fell in the lower-left quadrant,\" said Zorina. \"We deemed those to be \\'likely cloneable.\\' Their performance can be mostly replicated with passive products, and they didn\\'t deliver enough alpha to offset the cost. On the other hand, some funds fell in the lower-right quadrant, offering similar factor profile and greater alpha relative to their respective factor-mimicking portfolios.\"\\nInvestors should also consider other factors that will contribute to the fund\\'s ability to achieve better long-term results, including lower fees, long-term perspective, a keen focus on risk optimization and downside protection, and exposure to diversified sources of alpha.\\nVanguard Core Bond Fund: True-to-label alpha\\nThe paper\\'s authors applied the same methodology to gauge the \"cloneability\" of Vanguard Core Bond Fund. (The fund was launched March 28, 2016, so it was not part of the original study, which counted only funds with five-year track records through 2019.)\\nA combination of two bond ETFs—one a total market product and the other tracking an intermediate-term corporate credit benchmark—came close to simulating the fund\\'s return profile since inception though year-end 2020.\\nThe chart below shows that the weighting between the two proxy products had to change over time to mimic the fund\\'s performance. The weighting averaged around 91% for the market and 9% for intermediate-term credit.\\nProportional changes in factors to mimic Vanguard Core Bond Fund\\'s returns\\nNote: The graph illustrates a 36-month rolling window of the factor exposure of Vanguard Core Bond Investor. The varying proportion represents the optimal combination of market and corporate intermediate benchmarks to replicate Vanguard Core Bond Fund\\'s returns as closely as possible. The factor portfolios assumed monthly rebalancing and no transaction costs for rebalancing.\\nSource: Can active fixed income managers be cloned using style funds? A practical testing method. Vanguard calculations using data from Morningstar Direct from April 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020.\\n\\nThe regression analysis revealed that the tracking error was 0.50% and the adjusted R-squared was 0.98, meaning that the factor-mimicking portfolio tracked the Core Bond Fund’s returns very closely. Portfolio weights of both market and intermediate-term credit were statistically significant at 1%.\\nHowever, the Core Bond Fund delivered a gross alpha of 63 basis points relative to the proxy portfolio—63 bps generated from security selection and other alpha sources that could not be delivered by the proxies. This amount of alpha is significant for fixed income, particularly for a fund whose mandate is to keep a risk profile similar to the broad investment-grade bond market, putting it in the lower-right quadrant of the chart shown earlier.\\nTaking into account the 10 bps expense ratio of the fund\\'s Admiral Shares, the fund delivered 53 bps of net alpha (or 57 bps if you factor in the 4 bps expense ratio of the proxy portfolio).\\n\"During the research and design process before the fund\\'s launch, the Vanguard Fixed Income Group said it would expect the fund to have a slight credit tilt on average over time,\" Zorina said.\\n\"As per our analysis, the fund delivered returns equivalent to a mix of roughly 90% market and 10% intermediate-term credit while still providing alpha.

U.S. home prices rose 10.4% year-over-year in December 2020, their biggest jump since recovering from the global financial crisis.2 But pandemic-era supply-and-demand dynamics, rather than speculative excess, are likely driving the rise.\\nCryptocurrencies, on the other hand, have soared more than 500% in the last year.3 It\\'s a curious rise for an asset that is not designed to produce cash flows and whose price trajectory seems like that of large-capitalization growth stocks—the opposite of what one would expect from an asset meant to hedge against inflation and currency depreciation. Rational people can disagree over cryptocurrencies\\' inherent value, but such discussions today might have to include talk of bubbles.\\nWhat about U.S. stocks? The broad market may be overvalued, though not severely. Yet, forthcoming Vanguard research highlights one part of the U.S. equity market that gives us pause: growth stocks. Low-quality growth stocks especially test our \"plausible future income\" scenario. For some high-profile companies, valuation metrics imply that their worth will exceed the size of their industry\\'s contribution to U.S. GDP. Conversely, our research will show that U.S. value stocks are similarly undervalued.\\nLow-quality growth has outperformed the broad market\\nNotes: Data as of December 31, 2020. Portfolios are indexed to 100 as of December 31, 2010. Low-quality growth and high-quality value portfolios are constructed based on data from Kenneth R. French\\'s website, using New York Stock Exchange-listed companies sorted in quintiles by operating profit and the ratio of book value to market value (B/P). The low-quality growth portfolio is represented by the lowest quintile operating profit (quality) and B/P companies. The high-quality value portfolio is represented by the highest quintile operating profit and B/P companies. The broad U.S. stock market is represented by the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index (formerly known as the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000) through April 22, 2005; the MSCI US Broad Market Index through June 2, 2013; and the CRSP US Total Market Index thereafter.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from Ken French\\'s website at Dartmouth College, mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html; MSCI; CRSP; and Dow Jones.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\nLow-quality growth stocks—companies with little to no operating profits—have outperformed the broad market by 5.5 percentage points per year over the last decade. Of course, there are reasons why growth stocks may be richly valued compared with the broad market. Growth stocks, by definition, are those anticipated to grow more quickly than the overall market. Their appeal is in their potential. But the more that their share prices rise, the less probable that they can justify those higher prices. A small handful of these \"low-quality growth\" companies may become the Next Big Thing. But many more may fade into obscurity, as occurred after the dot-com bubble.\\nThe market for initial public offerings offers some insights (with my thanks to colleagues in Vanguard Quantitative Equity Group). Four out of five companies that offered shares on public markets for the first time in 2020 had earnings per share below zero. The percentage of such unprofitable IPOs has been nearly as high for the last several years, comparable to the numbers seen in the years leading up to the dot-com bubble. Such dynamics could create the catalyst for a hard landing for growth stocks. Of the unprofitable IPOs in 2020, more than 80% were in the technology and biotech sectors.4\\nUnprofitable IPOs are reminiscent of the dot-com bubble\\nNotes: As of December 31, 2020.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, using data from Jay R. Ritter\\'s website at the University of Florida, site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/ipo-data/, excluding American Depositary Receipts, natural-resource limited partnerships and trusts, closed-end funds, real estate investment trusts, special purpose acquisitions companies, banks and savings and loans, unit offers, penny stocks (with an offer price of less than $5 per share), and stocks not listed on the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange for all IPOs.\\n\\nValue stocks, by contrast, trade at prices below what company fundamentals suggest are reasonable. These steady companies seem to have been around forever and are likely to stay around. High-quality value stocks have underperformed the broad market by 15.5 percentage points per year over the last decade.\\nWe don\\'t expect the trends that defined the last decade to persist\\nAs we outlined in the Vanguard Economic and Market Outlook for 2021: Approaching the dawn, we expect equity markets outside the United States to outperform U.S. equities and expect value stocks to outperform growth. Our forthcoming fundamental assessment of growth and value stocks underscores our beliefs.\\nPerformance variation between investing styles and sectors is among the reasons Vanguard believes that investors should hold broadly diversified portfolios, as highlighted in Vanguard’s Principles for Investing Success (PDF). Those who do so benefit from a natural rebalancing that occurs over time as market segments outperform and underperform.\\nHowever, investors with conviction in their assessment of the markets, the time horizon to be patient, and the discipline to hold firm amid volatility may benefit from an overweight allocation to value stocks commensurate with their risk tolerance. Such a tilt could help offset the lower broad-market returns we expect in the decade ahead compared with the decade past.\\nWe appreciate that fast-rising assets may grow richer still. But, at some point, the markets will be faced with a question related to our definition of asset bubbles: What plausible future income scenario justifies an asset’s price? We expect that valuations eventually will reflect companies’ true probability of profitability, especially in the most-stretched corners of the market.\\nI’d like to thank Ian Kresnak, CFA, and my colleagues in Vanguard Quantitative Equity Group for their invaluable contributions to this commentary.\\n\\xa0\\n1 Goetzmann, William N., 2016.

       "  'content': 'When it became clear early in 2020 that the COVID-19 pandemic stood to convulse the global economy, central banks acted swiftly, slashing interest rates to near zero and establishing programs to buy government and corporate bonds by the hundreds of billions of dollars, euros, and pounds.\\xa0\\nNow, amid hope that vaccines will drive immunity and enliven economic activity this year, investors are starting to wonder what comes next. What happens when a \"whatever it takes\" approach to fiscal and monetary policy gives way to an unwinding of bold actions?\\n\\'We\\'re still very much in the middle\\' of the pandemic\\nInvestors should remind themselves that much of the world remains firmly in the pandemic\\'s grip—from both human and economic perspectives—and that the policy response stands to remain supportive in the months ahead.\\n\"We\\'re still very much in the middle of this,\" said Josh Hirt, a U.S.-based Vanguard senior economist. \"It may feel less like an emergency now, and we think we have a better understanding of an eventual end point thanks to vaccine developments. But the trajectory of the economy still very much depends on health outcomes.\"\\nThe idea, Hirt said, is to limit \"scarring,\" providing enough support so that reduced economic activity doesn’t turn into insolvencies, and temporary job losses don\\'t become permanent.\\nFiscal and monetary support has been unprecedented\\nNotes: Change in fiscal policy is represented by the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance from 2019 through September 30, 2020.\\nSources: Vanguard, U.S. Congressional Budget Office, Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and International Monetary Fund, as of September 30, 2020.\\n\\nThe United States passed the $2.2 trillion CARES Act in March 2020 and a further $900 billion relief package in December and is considering further fiscal support. The U.S. Federal Reserve has committed to indefinite purchases of U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities totaling at least $120 billion per month.\\nThe similarly accommodative European Central Bank expanded its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme in December to a total of €1.85 trillion (USD 2.25 trillion) and extended its purchase window through at least March 2022. On the fiscal side, most European governments have run large deficits over the last year to support jobs and businesses. The €750 billion (USD 910 billion) Next Generation EU pandemic recovery program begins disbursements this year.\\nMeanwhile, China—where the pandemic originated—is widely viewed as having controlled the virus effectively. Its fiscal and monetary support was modest compared with other large economies, and its economy registered growth for full-year 2020.\\n\"Life was largely back to normal in the middle of last year in China,\" said Alexis Gray, a Melbourne-based Vanguard senior economist. \"People were going back to offices, and restaurants and cinemas were open. There have been some regionalized outbreaks, but those have so far been squashed. So if you look on a national level, life is for the most part normal, which is obviously very different to what we\\'re seeing in the United States and in Europe.\"\\nEasy monetary policy means easy borrowing terms\\nNote: The forecast represents 3.5% nominal GDP growth, an average debt interest cost of 1.2%, and a 2.5% budget deficit.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, based on data from Refinitiv and the International Monetary Fund, as of September 30, 2020.\\n\\nThe confluence of fiscal support and accommodative monetary policy isn\\'t coincidental, said Shaan Raithatha, a London-based Vanguard economist: \"Emergency quantitative easing programs have helped financial conditions remain easy. This, in turn, has allowed governments to borrow large amounts of debt in a more sustainable way.\"\\nWith COVID-19 still raging, Raithatha doesn\\'t foresee monetary policy normalizing for at least the next 12 months. In Europe, he said, the risks are actually skewed toward further acceleration of quantitative easing purchases in the short term amid tighter virus-containment restrictions.\\nThe low-interest-rate environment should help governments avoid the sorts of restrictive austerity measures that prolonged recovery from the global financial crisis, most notably in Europe. Government borrowing to finance the recovery from the pandemic is locked in at today\\'s ultralow rates, Raithatha noted.\\n\"As long as nominal GDP growth rates exceed the nominal cost of debt and budget deficits start to normalize from their current exceptional levels, which you\\'d expect once the threat from COVID-19 has passed, government debt-to-GDP ratios are likely to gradually fall over time,\" he said.\\nVanguard\\'s chief economist for the Americas, Roger Aliaga-Díaz, explained the fiscal math behind debt sustainability in a June 2020 article.\\nHow will investors react to a bump in inflation?\\nAlthough the fight against the pandemic remains front and center, ever-forward-looking investors have begun to fret about the timing and implications of an unwinding of support—something that the Federal Reserve said on January 27 was premature to consider. Here again, recovery from the global financial crisis holds the power to inform. In what became known as the \"Taper Tantrum,\" U.S. Treasury yields spiked upon news, in 2013, that the Fed would trim asset purchases. This time, the Fed emphasizes that eventual scaling back of asset purchases will be clearly signaled well in advance.\\nReversal of quantitative easing is a logical first step toward policy normalization, for which the benchmark interest rate is the primary lever. Investors\\' underlying fear is that inflation could drive rates higher—and a test may lie ahead. \"We anticipate a decent bump above 2% inflation in the United States sometime in the middle of the year,\" Hirt said. \"What does this do to investor psychology?\"\\nVanguard believes that this bump will be transitory, in part because of base effects, or low year-earlier comparisons, and that structural forces will keep full-year U.S. inflation below the Fed\\'s 2% target. It should be noted, too, that the Fed in 2020 adopted an \"average inflation targeting\" strategy, allowing inflation to exceed its target without fostering a rate hike as long as inflation averaged 2% over time.\\n\"There is a risk for portfolios,\" Hirt said, \"that in a well-supported policy environment the eventual vanquishing of the pandemic unleashes strong demand and \\'animal spirits\\' that could influence inflation psychology, pressuring the Fed to act sooner than currently anticipated.\" Such a scenario could engender capital losses in bond portfolios and remove some of the justification for the higher valuations currently supporting equity markets.\\nVanguard doesn\\'t anticipate such a scenario this year. As we note in the Vanguard economic and market outlook for 2021: Approaching the dawn, we see it as unlikely that short-term rates will rise in any major developed market as monetary policy remains highly accommodative. And we see global equities as neither grossly overvalued nor likely to produce outsize returns.\\nAn ever-present risk for investors, meanwhile, can be trying to outsmart the market as to when—and whether—potential scenarios play out. That\\'s why we advocate that investors follow Vanguard\\'s Principles for Investing Success: Set clear investment goals, ensure that portfolios are well-diversified across asset classes and regions, keep investment costs low, and take a long-term view.'},\n",

The first vaccines to emerge from clinical trials proved more effective than even the most optimistic assessments, raising the confidence of public health experts and investors alike, as I wrote late last year.\\nNow, even as infections and hospitalizations remain elevated and new disease variants appear to spread more quickly, we remain confident that the developed world will begin to show meaningful progress against the pandemic in the months ahead.\\nThe essential variable? Vaccine distribution. Despite a slow start, the pace of vaccinations in the United States now exceeds one million per day.1 We’re early in the rollout, and we believe that initial distribution bottlenecks—attributable in no small part to stockpiling scarce supply to ensure second doses—are surmountable. A change in strategy that prioritizes first doses and increased vaccine production should ensure that the pace of vaccinations accelerates.\\nThe path to herd immunity depends on the pace of vaccinations\\nNotes: This analysis, as of January 25, 2021, discounts people who achieve immunity through infection. The gray buffers around the vaccination trend lines reflect the impossibility of precisely predicting when herd immunity may be achieved.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nAs a result, our analysis suggests, the United States can approach herd immunity in the second half of the year, consistent with our view in our Vanguard economic and market outlook for 2021. As our forecast further notes, the timing of when herd immunity is achieved relates directly to our outlook for the global economy. The path of economic recovery hinges critically on health outcomes; we expect to see business and social activity normalize as we approach herd immunity.\\nThe more quickly this occurs, the more quickly we’re likely to see unemployment rates trend downward, inflation move toward central bank targets, and output reach pre-pandemic levels.\\nOur analysis makes several assumptions, and we acknowledge that COVID-19 continues to present many unknowns. Our analysis assumes herd immunity thresholds—the percentage of a population that needs to be immune for herd immunity to kick in—of 66% and 80%. The 66% is a widely discussed COVID-19 threshold. If new strains in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and elsewhere prove more infectious, a more conservative threshold such as 80% may be more appropriate.\\nFinally, our analysis assumes that the vaccines now in use will prove effective against COVID-19 mutations. We know that the virus has mutated several times since its inception, yet vaccines based on its initial genetic sequencing have still proved remarkably effective.\\nThe pandemic has upended the lives of nearly everyone.

I discussed in a recent web article how such work-from-home arrangements represent a sharp acceleration of a trend that was already under way before COVID-19. But the big question for the U.S. economy is how many jobs, and what types, could permanently become remote 100% of the time, even after an effective vaccine is eventually distributed?\\nThe answer could have undeniable effects on workers, employers, and the economy. For example, if tech workers can just as easily do their jobs from home offices in Toledo or Tulsa or Topeka, do Silicon Valley firms need vast California campuses? And what would that mean for businesses that rely on such a concentration of workers and for commuting patterns? What would it mean for real estate prices, both commercial and residential?\\nEvaluating the future of remote work\\nNote: Data as of September 30, 2020.\\nSource: Vanguard calculations, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics O*NET database.\\n\\nOur 2018 Vanguard research paper The Future of Work found that, contrary to some reports, technology isn’t widely causing jobs to disappear, but it is profoundly changing nearly all of them. A job is broadly the sum of its tasks. Our paper examined the 41 work activities, or tasks, that make up the nearly 1,000 occupations tracked by the U.S. Department of Labor and found that, since 2000, tasks have widely shifted from being basic and repetitive toward “uniquely human” tasks that rely on creative problem-solving.\\nIn that study, we focused on the number of jobs needed in the future (answer: more in total), without worrying about where those jobs were located and whether certain ones could be done remotely. But as the graphic above shows, we’ve now done just that. We updated our task framework within the Labor Department’s universe of occupations. Now, though, we’ve scored each occupation’s associated tasks on a scale of 0 to 10 for remote-work potential. A score of 0 represents a task that can’t be accomplished remotely at all, while a 10 represents a task that can be performed entirely remotely with equal effectiveness.\\nWe then looked at which tasks were critically important to a given job. For example, a bartender’s work includes the critically important task of mixing drinks but also the not critically important task of data entry.\\nFinally, we assessed which occupations had a high overall remote score among critically important tasks. We find, as you can see in the graphic, that roughly 15% of all U.S. jobs could be conducted remotely. Although that percentage may sound small, it represents potentially over 20 million U.S. workers. That’s a large number.\\nOur assessment included a conservative threshold of 60% for critically important tasks, meaning that some effectiveness could be “lost” with certain tasks being done remotely, but that 60% effectiveness was good enough to complete the task. A higher threshold would mean that fewer occupations and workers could permanently work remotely.\\nThe first takeaway of our remote-work assessment\\nPerhaps our graphic’s most intriguing feature is the high percentage of occupations in the middle—the dots between all-remote and the pre-pandemic normal. This suggests to me that a hybrid model for the future of work may emerge for many of us, one in which remote work may suffice for days or weeks at a time, but not the entire year. After all, while a job may be the sum of its tasks, a career involves much more. There are many \"uniquely human\" tasks that many occupations share; such as training, mentoring, and collaboration for which fully remote work may pose challenges.\\nIn the Vanguard economic and market outlook 2021: Approaching the dawn, which we’ll publish in December 2020, we’ll further discuss trends that may have been either accelerated (such as remote work) or altered by COVID-19 and assess their economic and market implications.\\nBut our initial read of remote work, using our data-driven framework, suggests that for many of us, the future of work will be like neither the past nor the present. It suggests that, for certain occupations, a hybrid model may emerge that combines the power of social interaction with the flexibility of remote work.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'As the effective October-end deadline draws near for defining the terms of a post-Brexit trade relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, one thing is already perfectly clear: The original vision of a comprehensive free-trade deal has given way to two potential limited outcomes that aren\\'t tremendously different from each other in their likely long-term economic effects.\\nWe\\'ll learn soon whether the parties can strike a deal on a new bare-bones trade relationship to take effect January 1, 2021, or whether they\\'re resigned to a no-deal scenario of tariffs and quotas as defined by the World Trade Organization.\\nEither way, customs checks on cross-border goods will become a fact of life. Deal or no deal will also determine whether those checks occur between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which could have its own longer-term implications beyond trade.\\nWhile important issues remain, some of the more pressing concerns—for example, allowing E.U. financial institutions to keep operating in the U.K. while they work to secure full U.K. authorization—have been allayed.\\nThe implications for markets also hinge on deal versus no deal, with the U.K. currency and stock markets likely to come under pressure in the absence of some sort of deal. But the bulk of the markets\\' response has been baked into prices since that early-summer day more than four years ago when U.K. voters chose their go-it-alone path, and investors would be wise to tune out the market noise that either scenario is likely to generate.\\nDownsides to lack of a trade deal\\nThe economic downsides of no deal exceed those of a bare-bones deal. A no-deal scenario would create, to all intents and purposes, a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (an E.U. member) and would likely bring disruptions in the form of vigorous border checks, queues at ports, and a possible equity market sell-off.\\nYet a bare-bones agreement also would bring change. Like no deal, it would restrict cross-border movement of people between the E.U. and the U.K. And it would create a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. Neither is the case through year end, with the U.K. still operating under E.U. rules.\\nVanguard estimates a bare-bones deal would result in just over a 6% decline in U.K. gross domestic product over the next 10 years, compared with our GDP expectations if the U.K. were able to maintain current E.U. trade rules. No deal would worsen that decline to nearly 8%.\\nLong-run impact of Brexit on U.K. GDP\\nNotes: This figure shows the cumulative impact of Brexit on GDP by 2030. Productivity impact is estimated using a vector error correction model that incorporates a proxy for trade openness and foreign direct investment. Human capital growth is assumed to be unaffected by Brexit. Labor supply is assumed to grow at a similar rate to total population growth.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations based on Macrobond and the U.K. Office of National Statistics.\\n\\nTo be sure, the effects on GDP of either a bare-bones deal or no deal at all will pale in comparison to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. But while the COVID shock may eventually unwind once the crisis abates, the effects of Brexit on U.K. GDP are likely to persist over the next decade and beyond.\\nLack of a trade deal doesn’t have to be forever\\nBrexit was driven in part by the idea of the U.K. being able to strike out on its own and reach better trade deals with other countries. For the most part, this hasn\\'t happened. Yet.\\nThe U.K. has negotiated new trade deals with about half of the non-E.U. countries with which it previously had trade relationships through the E.U. But those countries represent only 18% of the U.K.\\'s trade, and for the most part, these deals broadly replicate the terms of the deals previously in place through the E.U.\\nExpectations for a comprehensive U.K.-E.U. trade agreement similar to the E.U.\\'s agreement with Canada were shredded long before the final grind to \"get Brexit done.\" The Canada agreement, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, took effect in 2017 after more than eight years of negotiation but still hasn’t been signed off on by all E.U. member states. A U.K.-U.S. trade deal has no immediate prospect. An Australia-style deal, which has also been mentioned, is essentially a no-deal option under which Australia-E.U. trade is conducted mostly by World Trade Organization rules.\\nAnd then there\\'s the question about future trade with the E.U., which has less at stake proportionately than the U.K.\\nTrade stakes are greater for U.K.\\nNote: U.K. imports from and exports to the E.U. are a much higher percentage of overall U.K. trade than are E.U. imports from and exports to the U.K.\\nSources: Vanguard calculations based on 2019 data from Macrobond and the U.K. Office of National Statistics.\\n\\nEven if no deal is reached with the E.U. in the short run, it doesn\\'t mean no trade deal permanently. When trying to make trade easier, the one group you want to make sure you trade with as easily as possible is your giant next-door neighbor that accounts for about half of your trade. A bare-bones deal would be a far smoother starting point, however.\\nU.K.-E.U. trade implications for investors\\nAs is often the case when a major market event occurs, investors should expect volatility over the coming months. The specifics of Brexit are difficult to predict, and risk perceptions can change quickly.\\nBut we believe that expectations about Brexit\\'s effect over time on fundamentals such as future profits are largely priced in. So the bar for investors is not whether Brexit will further affect asset prices, but whether you think you have a better view than everyone else about what happens next. That\\'s a very high bar, and it reinforces Vanguard\\'s belief that investors should maintain a balanced portfolio across asset classes and regions in keeping with their well-considered, long-term investment plan.'},\n",

Substantive changes to debt instruments, including replacing a reference rate, can be deemed by the IRS to be a taxable exchange, requiring the holder of the debt instrument to recognize a gain or loss.\\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed regulations that would allow issuers to replace LIBOR with SOFR (as well as certain other \"qualified\" rates), without causing a taxable exchange, so long as the replacement does not significantly change the fair market value of the debt instrument.\\nOnce finalized, these IRS regulations are likely to provide a way for issuers to replace LIBOR in a manner that would cause holders to avoid recognizing a gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\\nVanguard\\'s preparations for the LIBOR transition\\nBecause some Vanguard funds have exposure to LIBOR, we have established a governance program and developed a plan to help us navigate a transition away from that benchmark.

       "  'content': \"The American mathematician Claude Shannon famously established a lower bound for the number of possible moves in a typical chess match: around 10120. That's 10 with 119 zeroes after it. Reflecting on when the COVID-19 crisis began to unfold across the globe, I think the Shannon number adequately captures the breadth of possible economic outcomes at the time.\\nAs the crisis has evolved, however, two things have become clear: pandemic has accelerated some trends already in place, and COVID-19 will have implications that are opaque now but that will become undeniably clear and meaningful over time.\\nThe future accelerated\\nBefore the pandemic sent office staff flocking to home workstations, employers were taking an incremental approach to remote work. Recent improvements in office technologies let them untether workforces on a timetable of their choosing. The pandemic took the decision out of employers' hands.\\nSimilar to how issuers can recall certain bonds when conditions allow them to reissue on more favorable terms, the pandemic functioned as a call option on employers' incrementalism. No longer could work-from-home arrangements serve as controlled experiments in productivity; they became indispensable. Ready or not, employers for the most part have successfully enabled secure and efficient work from home and redefined team dynamics. The office will never be the same. Meanwhile, significantly reduced demand for office square footage, which had grown on a per capita basis for 50 years, stands to redefine our cityscapes and suburban makeups.\\nSimilarly, the pandemic has ground business travel to a halt. Historically the most profitable business for airlines and hotels, such travel has been replaced by video conferences and virtual collaboration tools. Such a development tests airline and hotel business models that rely on less-price-sensitive business travelers to help keep leisure travelers' costs low.\\nCOVID-19 has also accelerated the challenges facing restaurants and brick-and-mortar retailers. E-retail and food delivery, already growing in popularity before the pandemic, have become essential to consumers worried about face-to-face interaction. As with office work and air travel, restaurants and retail may not overcome heightened consumer reluctance until an effective vaccine or treatment is developed—something we're not expecting before 2021. In some cases, the damage could be permanent.\\nInterestingly, changes to commercial real estate, or at least how we invest in it, had already been occurring in plain sight. Over the last decade, office and retail constituents have fallen from 39% to 19% of equity REIT assets, while residential, infrastructure, and data centers—sectors that are likely to benefit from the pandemic—now make up 45%.1\\nPost-pandemic questions\\nAlthough some implications of the post-pandemic world are evident, others, for now, are more opaque:\\n\\nWill massive stimulus, supply-chain disruptions, and pent-up demand give rise to inflation that has eluded developed economies for a decade?\\nIs the globalization trend that has defined the post-World War II era ending, and what would that mean for trade and economic growth?\\nWith interest rates pinned at historic lows and deficits and balance sheets expanding, what can central banks do to support employment and price stability?\\n\\nAnd what becomes of inequality, a statistically significant detractor from a nation's economic health that increased after the 2008 global financial crisis?2 Our current crises (both health and economic) are disproportionately affecting people of certain races and socio-economic groups. Though I'm encouraged by emerging conversations that are both thoughtful and action-oriented, it's not yet clear whether the pandemic will accelerate or reverse the inequality trend.\\nThese questions will demand our attention and continue to act as source material for articles in the months and years ahead. It is likely that answers to some of these questions will materially affect the trajectory of others. In that sense, the number of possible moves left in our chess match still includes a whole lot of zeroes.\\n\\n\\n\\nMarket perspectives: September 2020\\nEconomic growth may slow later in the year, with COVID-19 progression and the prospects for a vaccine remaining the key drivers of economic activity.View article\\n\\n\\n\\nIs there a disconnect between the economy and the markets?\\nVanguard believes that a fundamental reason exists for equity markets having bounced back so far from their pandemic-induced shock.View article\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'Since the remarkable equity market reversal in developed countries in late March, many clients have asked whether markets have become irrational. Given the extreme uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, record unemployment, and eye-watering declines in second-quarter GDP, how can the markets have flirted with all-time highs?\\nPossible answers range from \"there\\'s no alternative\" to young investors\\' driving the market through new digital investor platforms. Our Investment Strategy Group, however, thinks that the answer is fundamental. And we don\\'t believe that U.S. equity markets are acting irrationally.\\nMathematics and value judgments\\nAt their core, financial markets reflect assessments of the value of assets today based on investors\\' expectations for the cash those assets will generate. This concept of net present value is more concretely applied to fixed income, where the known values for yields and coupon payments produce the price. Knowing two of the three values allows investors to determine the third.\\nThe concept applies equally to equity markets. Price plays the same role as in fixed income; future cash flows equate to the coupon, and the required rate of return equates to yield to maturity. The challenge for equities is the inherent uncertainty around future cash flows—the earnings that companies will reinvest in the business or distribute in dividends.\\nMuch of the assessment of these future cash flows is related to current financial conditions. Because of the market\\'s forward-looking nature, prices react to changing corporate and economic conditions faster than traditional economic data can.\\nThree telling events\\nThough COVID-19 remains a real risk to the global economy, three important things happened in recent months to cause equity markets to reassess return prospects after the fall into bear market territory. Long-term bond yields declined steeply, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate to zero, and already-low inflation expectations fell even further. These factors caused the required rate of return to plummet. The present value of equities increases as the required rate of return decreases.\\nA fair value for U.S. equities\\nNotes: Vanguard\\'s U.S. fair value CAPE framework is based on a statistical model that corrects measures of cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratios for the level of inflation expectations and for interest rates. The statistical model specification is a three-variable vector error correction including equity-earnings yields, ten-year trailing inflation, and ten-year U.S. Treasury yields. For details, see Vanguard\\'s Global Macro Matters paper As U.S. Stock Prices Rise, the Risk-Return Trade-Off Gets Tricky (Joseph Davis, 2017).\\nSources: Vanguard calculations as of July 31, 2020, based on data from Robert Shiller\\'s website at aida.wss.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm., the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Reserve Board, and Global Financial Data.\\n\\nVanguard\\'s proprietary fair value CAPE (cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio) framework models the relationship among equity valuations, long-term bond yields, and inflation. It shows a fair value range that has moved higher since the first quarter. Interestingly, the S&P 500 CAPE at the end of July falls right in the middle of this range, meaning that valuations as of that date are fair based on interest rates and inflation, which we view as a proxy for the required rate of return.\\nAs for the future …\\nWhat does this mean for future equity prices? That depends. A higher fair value range now won\\'t necessarily remain elevated or continue to increase. Nor does it mean that market prices won\\'t deviate from fair value temporarily. A normalization in interest rates and inflation expectations would cause fair value to fall (all else being equal), but prices may not immediately follow because of other short-term factors. Over longer periods, though, we\\'d expect these deviations to revert to fair value as they have over the last 70 years, as shown in the illustration.\\nVanguard\\'s global economics team doesn’t expect monetary policy to normalize anytime soon. On the contrary, we believe the federal funds rate will remain near zero at least through 2021. We also believe that demand-supply imbalances will likely lead to lower (not higher) inflation in developed countries for the foreseeable future, despite unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy. This would suggest that fair value is unlikely to change significantly.\\nBetter-than-expected news about the development of a vaccine or effective therapy could cause equity prices to deviate into overvalued territory. Conversely, if these developments take longer or containment measures prove unsuccessful, prices could move into undervalued territory as market sentiment suffers.\\nAccurately predicting such surprises and untangling them from market prices is difficult at best. We may not be able to predict the market’s next move with any degree of confidence, but we can say that a reasonable basis exists for its current level.\\nThe writer would like to acknowledge the contributions of Kelly Farley and Ian Kresnak, CFA, to this commentary.\\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the pandemic: What to expect from stocks, bonds\\nRead this introduction to how Vanguard\\'s return expectations for stocks and bonds have changed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.View article\\n\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nAll investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.\\nInvestments in bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, and inflation risk.\\n\\nCFA® is a registered trademark owned by CFA Institute.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The volatility of the financial markets during the first half of 2020, punctuated by the most sudden, steep decline in U.S. market history, tested the mettle of most investors. Despite the gut-wrenching drop of nearly 34% in the S&P 500 Index in just over a month, Vanguard investors held firm, sticking with their plans and, in some cases, rebalancing into equities during the downturn. This discipline ultimately results in better outcomes over the long term.\\nThe courage to stay the course\\nWe\\'ve long professed that short-term market movements—whether up or down—should not dictate one\\'s investment strategy. The data show that Vanguard investors agree, and the overwhelming majority stayed invested through the recent volatility. Less than 0.5% of investors abandoned their portfolios and moved entirely to cash. A willingness to weather sudden market drops is an important part of long-term investing. Although it is a natural instinct to seek to preserve capital when the market drops precipitously, too often investors remain on the sidelines and miss the inevitable recovery.\\nBack in March, we reminded investors to stay the course. A balanced, diversified portfolio is built to weather tough markets. The majority of investors (83%) held fast from late February to May and didn\\'t transact. Even better, 9% of our clients rebalanced into the storm, buying equities and regaining their targeted asset allocations. Rebalancing helps mitigate risk, and it is a staple of our advice.\\nInvestors in Vanguard retirement accounts have shown the lowest proclivity to trade. IRA holders and participants in defined contribution plans trade at minimal levels and far less than other cohorts. They truly keep a long-term perspective and don\\'t get thrown off by short-term volatility.\\nWhy is staying the course so important? As an extreme example, consider the investor who lost faith in the markets and cashed out on March 23, the low point in the U.S. stock market. Stocks subsequently rebounded more than 39% over the next three months; the unfortunate individual who moved to a money market fund earned a meager 0.14%. Our analysis found that about 85% of investors who fled to cash would have been better off if they had just held their own portfolio.\\nEven-keeled at all times\\nJust as investors should stay even-keeled during downturns, they should ignore the euphoria of a sudden surge in the market and the fear of missing out on easy gains. One byproduct of the market churn is the renaissance of day trading among individual investors. Online brokerage platforms saw new accounts spike in the early part of 2020, with many of these investors looking to capitalize on \"hot\" stocks or engage in speculative moves. Fortunately, the vast majority of Vanguard investors are staying disciplined and avoiding speculation. We have seen this movie before and know how it ends for the FOMO crowd—an expensive lesson about diversification.\\nThank you to our clients\\nWe would be remiss if we did not thank you for helping investors stay disciplined and focused on the long run. We are here to help reinforce those best practices and are grateful for the commitment each of you has shown our company. Investors added $130 billion in net new investments to Vanguard funds during the first seven months of 2020.

       "  'content': 'At the end of last year, Vanguard published its annual global economic outlook for 2020 and beyond. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, upending financial markets and the global economy.\\nWe sat down with economists in Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group to take stock of how the pandemic has reshaped their outlook for the economy and where they see markets going from here.\\nThe title of Vanguard’s outlook for 2020 was “The New Age of Uncertainty.” It seems almost prophetic in retrospect.\\nJoe Davis, Vanguard global chief economist: It\\'s true that we were expecting heightened uncertainty this year owing to concerns about global growth, unpredictable policymaking, trade tensions, and Brexit negotiations. But we couldn\\'t have foreseen a viral pandemic that would be so devastating in terms of human cost, curtailed economic activity, and disrupted financial markets. It\\'s really an unprecedented event that defies conventional labels.\\nWe\\'ve been broadly supportive of the extraordinarily rapid and robust monetary and fiscal responses from governments worldwide to blunt the damage. Many central banks have embraced a \"whatever it takes\" approach, which has included slashing interest rates and providing liquidity to financial markets. And the world\\'s largest economies have committed more than $9 trillion in spending, loans, and loan guarantees toward countering the negative effects of the pandemic.1\\nThat notwithstanding, while this may be the deepest and shortest recession in modern economic history, I want to stress that we see a long road back to a previrus economy.\\nWith many countries having just gone through extraordinarily quick and sharp declines in GDP, there\\'s been a lot of speculation in the financial media about what shape the recovery will take. What\\'s Vanguard’s view?\\nPeter Westaway, Vanguard chief economist for Europe: Indeed, the hit to economic activity has been severe. We estimate the overall peak-to-trough global GDP contraction was around 9% in the first half of 2020. Comparable collapses in economic activity are hard to find outside wartime: Global GDP fell 6% peak to trough during the global financial crisis,2 for example, and by 1.8% during the 1973 oil crisis.3\\nSo what will the recovery look like? Will it be V-shaped or U-shaped? Probably a little of both. We anticipate a first phase characterized by a rapid recovery in the supply side of the economy as businesses reopen and restrictions are eased. We expect that to be followed by a second, more protracted phase in which demand, especially in sensitive face-to-face sectors, only gradually returns.\\nOverall the trajectory of the recovery is likely to be an elongated U-shape, with GDP growth not returning to normal until well into 2021 and quite possibly beyond in major economies. The one exception is China. Our baseline assessment is that a vaccine won\\'t be widely available before the end of 2021; a vaccine sooner than that would make us more optimistic about the prospects for recovery. But we unfortunately see risks around our forecast skewed to the downside, strongly linked to health outcomes and the potential for instances of the virus to necessitate renewed widespread shutdowns.\\nProjected economic recovery in the United States\\nNotes: The chart shows our expectation for the level of impact on real GDP. Total GDP impact signifies the percentage-point change in the level of GDP.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nQian Wang, Vanguard chief economist for Asia-Pacific: Peter mentioned that China would be an exception. We expect the recovery to be faster and more V-shaped in China, for a couple of reasons. China has so far managed to contain the virus relatively quickly, and its economy has a larger share of manufacturing and construction activities, which rely less on face-to-face interaction and benefit from the government boost to infrastructure investment. In fact, we\\'re seeing many industries in China not only recovering but clawing back lost output not produced during the lockdown, so we expect its economy to return more quickly to previrus levels.\\nProjected economic recovery in China\\nNotes: The chart shows our expectation for the level of impact on real GDP. Total GDP impact signifies the percentage-point change in the level of GDP.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nRoger Aliaga-Díaz, Vanguard chief economist for the Americas: Latin America, meanwhile, faces an especially challenging period. Brazil, Latin America\\'s largest economy, has had a particularly hard time containing the virus. The World Health Organization puts the number of confirmed cases in that country second only to the number in the United States.4 Peru, Chile, and Mexico also are among the ten countries with the highest number of confirmed cases, according to the WHO. The International Monetary Fund in June downgraded its economic outlook for Latin America to a full-year contraction of 9.4%, having projected a contraction of 5.2% for the period just three months earlier.\\nJoe Davis: I\\'d add a word of context about GDP data for the second half of 2020. We expect to see a rebound in quarterly GDP growth rates, especially in the third quarter, when restrictions on activity related to the virus will have eased to a degree. And that will doubtless generate positive headlines and more talk of a V-shaped recovery. A more relevant measure than the quarterly rate of change, though, is the underlying level of GDP. And for 2020, for the first time in modern economic history, we expect the global economy to shrink, by about 3%. We believe that some of the largest economies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the euro area, will contract by 8% to 10%.\\nHow the pandemic has reshaped our GDP projections for 2020\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nWhat does the prospect of only gradual economic growth mean for employment?\\nPeter Westaway: A lot depends on the fate of furloughed workers. Official measures of unemployment across the globe have risen by historically unprecedented amounts in a short time. And unfortunately, in many countries the true unemployment picture is even worse once furloughed workers are considered—those who are not working but are being paid by governments or employers. There\\'s a chance that furloughed workers could move straight back into work as lockdowns end, which would make this type of unemployment not so costly. But there\\'s a risk that high unemployment will persist, especially considering those who have already lost jobs permanently and the furloughed workers who may not easily move back into work.\\nAt the end of last year, Vanguard was expecting inflation to remain soft. Has your forecast changed in light of the pandemic?\\nJoe Davis: Not significantly. Many commentators have talked up the prospect of a resurgence in inflation in 2021, particularly as the debt-to-GDP ratios of developed economies have increased dramatically because of spending to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. We think it\\'s more likely that inflation overall will be held in check by demand lagging a rebound in supply in all the major economies, especially in face-to-face sectors that we believe will experience a high degree of consumer reluctance until there is a vaccine. That, in turn, could set the stage for central banks to maintain easy terms for accessing money well into 2021.\\nLet\\'s get to what investors may be most interested in—Vanguard\\'s outlook for market returns.\\nJoe Davis: In short, stock market prospects have improved since the market correction, while expected returns from bonds remain subdued. Let\\'s take a closer look at global stocks first. They lost more than 30 percentage points earlier this year and volatility spiked to record levels, then they rallied strongly to regain most of their losses. Despite the negative macroeconomic outlook, we believe there is a reasonable basis for current equity market levels given the impact of low rates, low inflation expectations, and the forward-looking nature of markets.\\nWith current valuations lower than at the end of last year and a higher fair-value range because of lower interest rates, our outlook for U.S. and non-U.S. stock returns has improved considerably for U.S.-based investors. Over the next ten years, we expect the average annual return for those investors to be:\\n\\n4% to 6% for U.S. stocks\\n7% to 9% for non-U.S. stocks\\n\\nSuch differentials, which change over time, help explain why we believe portfolios should be globally diversified.\\nAs for bonds, current yields normally provide a good indication of the level of return that can be expected in the future. With monetary policy having turned more accommodative, our expectation for the average annual return for U.S.-based investors has fallen by about 100 basis points since the end of 2019, to a range of 0% to 2% for U.S. and non-U.S. bonds.\\nAdmittedly, we are in a low-yield environment with low forecast returns for bonds, but we expect high-quality globally diversified fixed income to continue to play the important role of a risk diversifier in a multi-asset portfolio.\\nIt did so earlier this year. Consider a globally diversified portfolio with 60% exposure to stocks and 40% exposure to currency-hedged global fixed income, from a U.S. investor\\'s perspective. It is true that over a few days, the correlation between the global equity and bond markets was positive and that they moved relatively in tandem, but for the first half of 2020, a globally diversified bond exposure acted as ballast, helping to counter the riskier stock component of the portfolio.\\nBonds proved their value as a diversifier of risk in a portfolio\\nNotes: Global equity is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index, global bonds are represented by the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index hedged to USD, and the 60/40 portfolio is made up of 60% global equity and 40% global bonds.\\nSources: Vanguard and Bloomberg.\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.\\n\\nI\\'d caution that investors may be running the risk of pricing assets close to perfection, assuming that corporate profitability will be restored soon or that central bank support can maintain buoyant asset markets for the foreseeable future.\\nWe would advise, as always, that investors maintain diversified portfolios appropriate to their goals, and to invest for the long term. Attempting to time the market during extreme market volatility is tempting but rarely profitable.\\n1 International Monetary Fund as of May 13, 2020.\\n2 The Impact of the Great Recession on Emerging Markets, International Monetary Fund working paper, 2010.\\n3 Maddison, Angus, 1991.

       "  'content': \"The unevenness of the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on economic growth across sectors and by geographic region requires an inspection of both traditional economic data and higher-frequency indicators. New Vanguard Global Macro Matters research analyzes these data in estimating when major economies may approach a full recovery. We expect China to do so more quickly than the United States, the euro area, or the United Kingdom.\\nHow industries will be affected by the pandemic\\nThe impact of containment measures for COVID-19 is not equal across industries. Sectors that are highly reliant on face-to-face interactions, such as retail trade, hospitality, and transport, are experiencing a large shock to activity. However, sectors that can operate relatively well with social distancing in place, such as construction and manufacturing, are less affected.\\nThe COVID-19 shock will have a varied impact on different sectors of the economy\\nNotes: Size of bubbles indicates the relative weight of each sector in U.S. GDP. Initial impact on the level of GDP and the persistence of shock estimated is based on a range of high-frequency indicators (such as mobility indexes, fuel consumption, retail foot traffic, and restaurant and hotel occupancy), and traditional economic indicators.\\nSources: Google, Apple, Johnson Redbook Index, American Iron and Steel Institute, U.S. Department of Energy, Association of American Railroads, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Prodco Analytics, Smith Travel Research, OpenTable, Transportation Security Administration, and SimilarWeb.\\n\\nGDP forecasts across countries\\nThe figures show our baseline forecasts of the level of GDP for the United States, the euro area, China, and the United Kingdom. In the U.S., we expect output to be more than 10% lower in the second quarter of 2020 before staging a slow and gradual recovery. U.S. GDP is not expected to get back to its pre-virus level until the end of 2021, and it likely will be well beyond that before it closes the output gap.\\nExpected path of GDP across the U.S., the euro area, China, and the U.K.\\nBaseline forecast\\nNote: The charts show our expectation for the level of real GDP in each country in its local currency, which has been rebased to December 2019 = 100.\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nWe expect slightly different trajectories for the level of GDP in other regions. This can be explained by a variety of factors, including:\\n\\nDifferences in the timing and severity of outbreaks.\\nStrictness of government lockdowns.\\nSpeed of the lockdown exit across sectors.\\nEconomy sector composition.\\nMonetary and fiscal policy responses.\\n\\nFor example, China has so far managed to contain the virus more quickly than the U.S. or Europe, and its economy has a smaller share dedicated to services, which rely more heavily on face-to-face interaction. It is therefore expected to recover to pre-virus levels more quickly. Get more insights on the worldwide economic activity in our full research paper below.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'The coronavirus pandemic has exacted a staggering toll in terms of economic impact and the loss of life. It has also produced many heroes, including frontline health care workers and retail employees who enable people to stay well provisioned in isolation.\\nFinancial advisors can serve a critical role as well by helping clients maintain their emotional well-being and increase their chances of emerging from the crisis with their financial dreams intact.\\nVanguard Senior Advice Strategist Mike DiJoseph recently answered a number of advisors\\' questions on how to help clients manage their emotions. He explained that taking such a behavioral coaching approach can help clients avoid making in-the-moment, reactionary decisions they may regret in the long run.\\nDiJoseph suggested approaching engagements with clients by using a “three A’s” framework (see graphic below):\\n\\nAssess the situation that demands a behavioral coaching solution.\\nAddress it by developing an appropriate course of action.\\nAudit the results and discuss them with clients, demonstrating your value in the process.\\n\\nBehavioral coaching: three A’s of action for advisors\\nSource: Vanguard.\\n\\nFollowing is a summary of DiJoseph\\'s question and answer session with advisors.\\nHow do you keep clients focused on long-term risk during crises such as the coronavirus pandemic?\\nFirst, it\\'s important to provide perspective on what a crisis happening in the moment is. So our team at Vanguard examined the questions: What do bear markets look and feel like in the moment and how does that compare with perceptions after the fact, with the benefit of hindsight?\\nFor example, we looked at the bear market from 2008 through 2009. We examined news headlines from that period and noted the overall sentiment of gloom they conveyed.\\nWe tracked the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 index from its market bottom in March 2009 to its recovery breakeven point less than two years later. By the time the headlines expressed positive sentiment, the market had already completely recovered.\\nWe\\'re not saying that scenario will play out again in the same way. And today\\'s crisis has the added dimension that it\\'s threatening people\\'s physical health. At the same time, it doesn\\'t mean this situation is never going to get better. We, as people offering our financial expertise, just need to provide that perspective. That\\'s the first part.\\nThe second part of keeping your clients thinking long term is to actually talk about what long term means to them. For most investors, it means meeting their goals. So I would suggest talking about what’s going on in terms of a client’s percentage progress toward those goals. Is the client still on track? Most advisors have already planned for periodic downturns that affect client portfolios. So it’s good to remind clients of that.\\nHow do you help clients who still want to sell out of the market based on extreme panic or fear?\\nOftentimes you just have to meet clients where they are. If you have a client who\\'s responding with emotions, I think you need to meet the client with emotions. If you have somebody who\\'s responding analytically, your initial engagement similarly would be analytic: Show the potential impact of what happens if the client bails out to cash, what returns the client might expect, and how the client’s ability to meet their goals might change.\\nI think for most people, investors and professionals alike, the most effective appeal is a combination of the two. This is the \"assess\" part of the three A\\'s framework: What happened to bear markets in the past and what happened in health crises in the past? How did those play out?\\nA huge part of this step is applying emotional intelligence and serving as the calming voice of reason—after letting the client voice their concerns in their own way. You may have heard of this referred to as \"EQ,\" or having the emotional quotient to interact sensitively with others. As an advisor, you need to have confidence that the work you’ve done upfront to put a plan in place will see a client through difficult times.\\nDepending on how clients react to that, sometimes it really does just come down to finding a compromise. Maybe you have a client who wants to completely bail out of the market no matter how much analysis you provide them with, no matter how emotionally soothing your advice may be: They\\'re just not really having it.\\nAnd in those cases, you might want to look at a very small bit of de-risking or even framing a decision not to rebalance as something that reduces risk.\\nHow should you talk with clients who are retirees or who want to retire soon?\\nIf a client just retired within the last year or two, or if the client is thinking about retiring next year, now can be a particularly scary time.\\nThe good news is there are a ton of things you can do as an advisor to add value. So when we\\'re talking about assessing that situation, you want to look into the client\\'s plan and see what their spending requirement is. What are those end goals?\\nThen, you need to address the situation—the second component of our framework—and there are a number of tools you can use.\\nSo, for example, many clients may have some tax losses that can be harvested. You should think about potentially cleaning up the portfolio itself with tools such as rebalancing, but there are also things such as asset location. That is, how are the assets distributed across different types of accounts, i.e., tax-deferred accounts, tax-free accounts, and taxable accounts?\\nYou can also address retirement spending. Our team at Vanguard has done research for years on what happens during market downturns when it comes to spending rates and spending strategies. What we\\'ve found is that decreasing spending by just 2.5% in lean years and increasing it a little bit in prosperous years—a concept we call dynamic spending—can have dramatic positive effects on the long-term outcome and viability of a portfolio.1\\nWhat is the distinction between cognitive error and emotional bias? And how can you mitigate the counterproductive effects of your clients\\' biases?\\nWe do need to draw a sharp distinction between behavioral finance and behavioral coaching. With behavioral finance, we\\'re talking about the heuristics and biases—why people make the decisions they do, why those decisions aren\\'t always rational, and why they may lead to bad outcomes.\\nYou could consider it a really scientific way to look at it. I liken it to IQ. I think behavioral coaching is really applying the EQ, the emotional intelligence, to connect with a client and overcome their natural biases. There is an intellectual aspect to it as well, but you\\'re really keying in on the client’s emotional state to guide them toward better financial decisions.\\nIt\\'s worth noting we\\'ve published work on the importance of positivity when you\\'re engaged in behavioral coaching.2\\nIt ties back to the idea mentioned earlier, of meeting emotion with emotion. It really comes down to positivity. And by that I don\\'t mean, \"Hey, everything\\'s fine, the market\\'s not down, and we\\'re not in the middle of a health crisis.\" Clients obviously know that\\'s not true.\\nInstead, I\\'m talking about reframing the situation: Being upfront about clients\\' reactions and telling them, \"Hey, they\\'re natural.\"\\n\"You feel like you want to bail from the stock market today. It\\'s natural to think that because it\\'s gone down for the last two or three weeks, and it\\'s likely to happen again. That\\'s okay.\"\\nThe positive aspect of this is simply acknowledging that it\\'s okay for them to have those worries. Fortunately, they\\'ve hired you to prepare them for something like this happening. That\\'s how you can make your clients feel a little more empowered—reminding them that their portfolios are prepared to weather the storm we\\'re in right now.\\nIs there a way to use this unique environment as an opportunity when it comes to prospecting and potentially helping a greater number of clients?\\nYou\\'re in the trenches with your clients in these trying times, building trust in the process. I think that will pay dividends as the clients you help today go forth, after the dust settles, and articulate their experience working with you. They will remember the way that you made them feel, and they\\'ll talk about it with potential prospective clients.\\nSomething you might consider in the \"opportunity basket\" is everything we\\'ve been seeing and hearing with the move to digital. In less than a month, we\\'ve undergone a massive societal change. We\\'ve transitioned from an office-based, person-to-person service paradigm to a setting where everything—in our space, at least—is digital.\\nThis is an interesting issue to think about for the audit portion of our framework. It\\'s a chance to really consider how you connect with others. And I think that\\'s going to be a big opportunity. We can see how this may be an inflection point for a world where geographic boundaries become less important in the advice industry. So I encourage you to start thinking through that—what lessons have you learned from the widespread adoption of digital meetings by necessity and how might you apply them to your advantage in the future?\\nA client\\'s portfolio is positioned a bit aggressively rather than being diversified. The client wants to know what you\\'re doing to stop the decline?\\nI would reframe the client\\'s question to, \"Is their asset allocation correct in the first place?\"\\nAsking someone how they feel about losing 30% on their investment in the middle of a crisis is probably a better depiction of true sentiment than asking a client how they feel at the height of a decade-long bull market.\\nThere\\'s a balance to strike, because you don\\'t necessarily want to be making wholesale changes to the financial plan during the crisis itself. Maybe you should just not rebalance and let the asset allocation change to more conservative from there. I think that might be a good compromise.\\nIt\\'s a big opportunity to give your client a win—talking about diversification now when a client can see, firsthand, precisely why it matters. Contrast that to the questions you might have been hearing just a few months ago: Why the heck do I have these bonds in my portfolio when the stock market\\'s up 30%?\\nOn a related note, some clients say they\\'ve been severely tested and they think bonds are the way to go. Thoughts on this sentiment?\\nYou might add some perspective on low rates going forward.\\nIt comes down to helping the client think through that sentiment: If the client were to take that course of action, what does that look like going forward? And you should do that in a way that ties it back to the emotional aspect of helping the client remember why they\\'re investing in the first place—to achieve a specific goal.\\nSo let\\'s say you have a 50-year-old client who wants to retire in ten years. But that seems out of reach given that the client has lost 10%, 20%, 30% of their portfolio value.\\nYou have to ask yourself, well, \"What are the alternatives?\" The alternative of reallocating assets to cash investments is probably going to get a zero return. With a reallocation to bonds, I think we all believe that bonds will continue to be a diversifying asset and a ballast to equity risk but I\\'m not sure bonds are really going to be a high-income-producing asset going forward.\\nSo put that in terms of what that means. How much does the client need for retirement and what are the client’s chances of reaching that if they make the decision to rebalance? Again—with empathy—explain that abandoning equities entirely means the client is almost guaranteed to not be able to meet that goal. So just a little bit of perspective can go a long way.\\n1 Colleen M. Jaconetti, Michael A. DiJoseph, Zoe B. Odenwalder, and Francis M. Kinniry Jr., 2016.

But given Medicare\\'s array of coverage options, how do retirement-age individuals know which version of the popular but complicated health insurance to choose?\\nA new Vanguard guide tells you what you need to know to help clients demystify the Medicare puzzle. To B or not to B: Making sense of Medicare\\'s alphabet soup goes beyond explaining Medicare\\'s different parts, premiums, and levels of coverage. It provides an easy-to-understand methodology that helps clients clarify the health plan features they value the most.\\n\\nFirst, clients should prioritize their needs. Upon reaching Medicare eligibility, they will be faced with a confusing alphabet soup of Medicare coverage options. Before they try to negotiate the array of choices, have them consider what elements of Medicare insurance coverage they think are most important.\\nEvaluate plan options based on how well they fit a client\\'s priorities. No plan is perfect for everyone, so individual clients must find the policy types that come the closest to meeting their priorities.\\nOnce your clients know their best matches, they can shop for specific policies. They will likely be able to choose from among several providers for the Medicare coverage option they choose. Encourage them to shop for the best deal where they live. Decisions around pharmaceutical coverage are a separate issue and revolve largely around the drugs that a client has been prescribed.\\n\\nFigure 1: A framework for choosing the right Medicare policy\\n\\nPrioritizeAsk a client: What do you want out of your coverage? Consider the trade-offs between affordability, flexibility, cost certainty, and worst-case protection.\\nEvaluate Map the features that you find most important to the strengths and weaknesses of different coverage types.\\nChoose Research specific policies. Ensure that clients enroll on time to avoid penalties and coverage gaps.\\nWith Medicare\\'s open enrollment period of October 15 through December 7, autumn is an opportune time to have conversations with clients about managing medical expenses—including health insurance—as part of the retirement planning process. To B or not to B facilitates that conversation by providing reminders of important deadlines, suggestions for weighing the merits of different policy choices, and examples of hypothetical retirees\\' plan choices.\\nAs the financial planning and advice industry moves to a more holistic planning model, guiding clients through health care matters and other life needs that affect their financial picture can enhance your value.'},\n",

Developed-market bond returns generally are positive when the USD is appreciating. This is because such periods are linked with risk-off behavior, when cash globally is flowing to safer assets such as developed-market bonds.\\nEquity asset returns are more sensitive to periods of USD appreciation or depreciation. Directionally, emerging- and developed-market equities behave the same way: USD appreciation coincides with negative returns and USD depreciation with positive returns.\\nWhen the dollar is appreciating, the impact on equity returns also reflects investors' risk-off behavior.\\nCompared with stand-alone equity returns, a balanced, globally diversified portfolio offers a middle path during periods of dollar appreciation or depreciation by being relatively shielded against USD movements.\"}}"

It offers a sector-by-sector analysis and a summary of how those views affect the Vanguard active bond funds.\\nKey highlights\\nPerformance\\nThe first half of 2022 was the worst six months for fixed income since either before the Civil War or George Washington was president, depending on the source. Interest rates are up. Credit spreads have widened. Global bond markets are spooked.\\nLooking ahead\\nPositive real yields now exist, with bond yields higher than expected inflation over the next five years and beyond. Corporates, municipals, high yield, and emerging markets present more opportunity than any time in the recent past. TINA has resigned—bonds offer an alternative with reasonable income again and have reestablished their role as a portfolio hedge to equity risk.\\nApproach\\nThe economic outlook remains hazy, so patience is still needed. In recent weeks, markets have priced in lower growth projections and fewer rate hikes for this cycle. Valuations have improved as recession fears grow, offering more value and better long-run returns. Risks of stickier-than-expected inflation or a policy overreaction must be factored in.'},\n",

The removal of policy support poses a new challenge for policymakers and a new risk to financial markets. Central banks will have to maintain the delicate balance between keeping inflation expectations anchored and allowing for a supportive environment for economic growth.\\nWhile the global economic recovery is likely to continue in 2022, we expect the low-hanging fruit of rebounding activity to give way to slower growth whether supply-chain challenges ease or not (see figure).\\nEstimated growth in 2022\\n4.0%\\nU.S.\\n4.0%\\nEuro area\\n5.0%\\nChina\\n5.5%\\nEmerging markets\\nSources: Vanguard calculations, as of September 30, 2021.'}]"
