       " 'content': 'Following recent volatility, will China’s markets roar again in the Year of the Tiger? 26/01/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Recent market turbulence in China may have attracted attention, but the country’s transformation story is far from over. The Year of the Tiger could offer multiple opportunities for investors, notably around sectors related to China’s future technologies and climate programmes. Key takeaways Volatility is a part of China’s investment story – as 2021 demonstrated – but the country’s development trajectory remains promising as we enter the Year of the Tiger Continued focus on innovation will continue to drive China’s transition from its previous status as “the factory of the world” China’s determination to be seen as a global leader on climate will inform policy – and create opportunities for investors Increased government intervention should not scare investors away, and could even drive thematic investment opportunities This lunar new year, China is celebrating the Year of the Tiger – but this festive period arrives off the back of several notable episodes of economic turbulence and market volatility. The MSCI China index fell 21% during 2021 due to slowing consumption, high-profile issues within the property market and increased regulatory interventions. At the same time, China has also committed to doubling its GDP by 2035 – a target that will require annual growth of 4.7%. The Covid-19 pandemic in China severely hampered economic growth initially – as it did worldwide – but China’s relative success in managing the coronavirus has helped its economy recover quickly. If China is to meet its long-term economic goals, it will need a clear way forward. Fortunately for investors, China has been upfront about how it plans to achieve such an ambitious target with a strategy centred around tech-related industries and sustainability – two keys to investing during the Year of the Tiger. The outlook for regulatory intervention Government crackdowns in areas including China’s property sector and offshore listings fuelled the volatility economic weakness. Should investors fear further regulatory interventions as the year unfolds? Onshore China equities may benefit from further US-China “decoupling” At one stage during the sell-down in autumn 2021, the MSCI China Index was underperforming the S&P 500 by more than 40% over a six-month period, the worst relative performance in at least a decade. There have been signs of a stabilisation in the early days of 2022 but China equities have still meaningfully trailed the US. But China equities do not all march in lockstep. There has been a marked divergence between China A-shares (which trade on the two main domestic Chinese exchanges) and offshore-dominated indices. In 2021, the MSCI China A Onshore Index returned 4.0%, compared to the offshore-dominated MSCI China Index’s return of -21.7%. In other words, during 2021, China A-shares outperformed by more than 25 percentage points. These market shifts are happening against the backdrop of a broader US-China market “decoupling”. The Chinese government has clamped down on domestic companies listing on US exchanges. The restrictions announced were accompanied by a stricter cross-border security and already seem to have driven many overseas listings closer to home. During the second half of 2021 to early December, only one mainland China-based company priced a US IPO, against the 29 that listed in Hong Kong. As this process of separating the two countries’ markets continues, investors who want to understand the nuances between markets and identify opportunities will need on-the-ground insights. Property concerns seem to have been managed A rapidly cooling property sector was a central factor in stockmarket turbulence in 2021, with high-profile stocks in the sector – most notably China Evergrande – suffering dramatic falls. This came amid broader weakness in the property market. In November last year, 61 of 70 cities covered by the national home price survey saw declines in primary house prices. This sustained weakness prompted regulators to intervene in an attempt to ease the worst of the funding and liquidity crunch. The regulatory intervention served to amplify volatility last year, but it may help usher in a managed decline in property prices during the coming year rather than a crash. Foreign interest in China appears relatively undimmed While China undoubtedly faces several headwinds, these challenges do not seem to have diminished its appeal to foreign organisations. Research from HSBC in late 2021 suggested that, of more than 2,000 foreign-based companies operating in China, 97% plan to maintain their presence and 60% plan to expand their supply chains in China – or are already expanding. Signs also suggest that Chinese policy changes have done little to stem venture capital investment. The shifting regulatory environment clearly demands attention from private equity investors trying to fund the next generation of leading Chinese companies, but the deal numbers suggest no slowdown in funding. According to research firm Prequin, venture capital investments in China during 2021 reached USD 130.6bn, a new record total and a 50% increase on 2020’s USD 86.7bn. Expect China’s continued emergence on the world stage The world’s eyes will be on China at the start of the new year with the Winter Olympics taking place in Beijing during February, and the country will be keen to present a positive image. Events in China during recent months demonstrate the need for investors to understand the broader political and social context within the country. A certain amount of volatility is part and parcel of investing in China, but a comprehensive grasp of the underlying environment can help investors navigate it. China is entering “Phase 3”: here’s why it matters We’ve written before about “Phase 3” of China’s emergence on the global stage, which could provide a platform for further opportunities for investors. (Phase 1 was when China joined the WTO and became as a major link in global supply chains, Phase 2 saw China overtake Japan as the second-largest economy and begin integration of its markets into the global financial system). Phase 3 is arguably the toughest as China attempts to use its economic might to establish and cement its place at the top table while exercising its “soft” powers of diplomacy to build influence. Sustainability is central to China’s ambitions A key part of China’s transition lies in its determination to be seen to be taking a lead on climate change. The country has set out clear decarbonisation goals, and it used last year’s COP26 UN climate change conference as a platform to announce its willingness to co-operate with the US to achieve them. Before COP26, China had already committed to reach a peak in carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2060. China is already the largest market for electric vehicles globally and, as Exhibit 1 shows, its reliance on EVs is expected to grow further. Similarly, government targets relating to energy provision (Exhibit 2) show a swing towards renewable sources before the 2060 deadline. Exhibit 1: China passenger vehicle sales breakdown by fuel type – government target penetration rates Source: JP Morgan estimate. Exhibit 2: China power generation breakdown (thousand terrawatt hours) Source: Goldman Sachs. Data as at January 2021. There is still a long way to go, but if China continues its current trajectory, climate and sustainability could provide the ideal opportunity to write a positive new chapter in its history. Expect continued focus on social issues Beijing has been emphasising its goal of “common prosperity”, which it plans to achieve by tackling wealth inequality and ensuring the entire population feels a part of China’s growth story. We believe this is driven as much by a political agenda as an economic one, and it has caused some issues for investors. In an attempt to ensure fairer access to education, the government imposed a major clampdown on the private education sector, and there is ongoing pressure on generic drug prices to ensure they are affordable. Investors’ instinct may be to be wary of any further policies in the name of common prosperity, but the initiative could still create further investment opportunities, possibly linked to trends like healthier living and increased consumption. Wealth inequality has been an issue in China for decades and, while it has not got significantly worse in recent years, it has attracted more public concern. The ruling Communist Party will want to be seen to be effectively tackling inequality in order to ensure legitimacy and popular support, especially as it approaches the 20th Party Congress in October, where President Xi Jinping will likely seek to be elected for a historic third term. What it all means for investors Here are four ideas for investors for the Year of the Tiger Seek out strategic sectors. Opportunities aligned with the topics above include sectors linked to China’s strategic need for self-sufficiency (semiconductors and robotics), and stocks linked to China’s carbon-emissions targets (renewable energy and the electric vehicle supply chain). Despite potential headwinds from the supply side (possible shortages of electricity and chips), we expect these sectors to continue to underpin China’s growth. Think “core” and “satellite” investments. One way to do this is by putting China A-shares at the core of a portfolio’s China allocation, and then adding thematic satellites focused on big-potential areas such as healthcare or future technologies. Themes relating to social trends like increased family sizes (incorporating branded baby clothes and food) and healthier lifestyles will also likely emerge. Accept the reality of volatility. Investors would be well-served by accepting that volatility has historically accompanied China’s stockmarket growth (see Exhibit 3). An active approach may help investors navigate the shifting environment and to use the inevitable volatility to build positions. Learn how policy shapes the future. It is essential to understand China’s economic, social and cultural history – and how its policy agenda is evolving. This can help investors discover where the country’s strategic priorities translate into opportunities. Those sectors that are central to the country’s planned transformation should continue to enjoy political support and are consequently also less likely to be affected by regulatory change.

(Phase 1 was when China joined the WTO and became as a major link in global supply chains, Phase 2 saw China overtake Japan as the second-largest economy and begin integration of its markets into the global financial system). Phase 3 is arguably the toughest as China attempts to use its economic might to establish and cement its place at the top table while exercising its “soft” powers of diplomacy to build influence. Sustainability is central to China’s ambitions A key part of China’s transition lies in its determination to be seen to be taking a lead on climate change. The country has set out clear decarbonisation goals, and it used last year’s COP26 UN climate change conference as a platform to announce its willingness to co-operate with the US to achieve them. Before COP26, China had already committed to reach a peak in carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2060. China is already the largest market for electric vehicles globally and, as Exhibit 1 shows, its reliance on EVs is expected to grow further. Similarly, government targets relating to energy provision (Exhibit 2) show a swing towards renewable sources before the 2060 deadline. Exhibit 1: China passenger vehicle sales breakdown by fuel type – government target penetration rates Source: JP Morgan estimate. Exhibit 2: China power generation breakdown (thousand terrawatt hours) Source: Goldman Sachs. Data as at January 2021. There is still a long way to go, but if China continues its current trajectory, climate and sustainability could provide the ideal opportunity to write a positive new chapter in its history. Expect continued focus on social issues Beijing has been emphasising its goal of “common prosperity”, which it plans to achieve by tackling wealth inequality and ensuring the entire population feels a part of China’s growth story. We believe this is driven as much by a political agenda as an economic one, and it has caused some issues for investors. In an attempt to ensure fairer access to education, the government imposed a major clampdown on the private education sector, and there is ongoing pressure on generic drug prices to ensure they are affordable. Investors’ instinct may be to be wary of any further policies in the name of common prosperity, but the initiative could still create further investment opportunities, possibly linked to trends like healthier living and increased consumption. Wealth inequality has been an issue in China for decades and, while it has not got significantly worse in recent years, it has attracted more public concern. The ruling Communist Party will want to be seen to be effectively tackling inequality in order to ensure legitimacy and popular support, especially as it approaches the 20th Party Congress in October, where President Xi Jinping will likely seek to be elected for a historic third term. What it all means for investors Here are four ideas for investors for the Year of the Tiger Seek out strategic sectors. Opportunities aligned with the topics above include sectors linked to China’s strategic need for self-sufficiency (semiconductors and robotics), and stocks linked to China’s carbon-emissions targets (renewable energy and the electric vehicle supply chain). Despite potential headwinds from the supply side (possible shortages of electricity and chips), we expect these sectors to continue to underpin China’s growth. Think “core” and “satellite” investments. One way to do this is by putting China A-shares at the core of a portfolio’s China allocation, and then adding thematic satellites focused on big-potential areas such as healthcare or future technologies. Themes relating to social trends like increased family sizes (incorporating branded baby clothes and food) and healthier lifestyles will also likely emerge. Accept the reality of volatility. Investors would be well-served by accepting that volatility has historically accompanied China’s stockmarket growth (see Exhibit 3). An active approach may help investors navigate the shifting environment and to use the inevitable volatility to build positions. Learn how policy shapes the future. It is essential to understand China’s economic, social and cultural history – and how its policy agenda is evolving. This can help investors discover where the country’s strategic priorities translate into opportunities. Those sectors that are central to the country’s planned transformation should continue to enjoy political support and are consequently also less likely to be affected by regulatory change.

Why it’s just the beginning for China’s RMB bond market 08/12/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary China’s efforts to provide greater access to the renminbi bonds market – work that began more than a decade ago – is giving international investors the confidence to increase their holdings. Key takeaways As China’s onshore bond market has opened up, China government bonds and policy bank bonds have been included in a number of major international bond indices, prompting many investors to rapidly build up their holdings Foreign investors are attracted to the added yield potential of China’s RMB bonds, plus the monetary policy flexibility of China’s central bank, but the steady stream of reforms is what has made these bonds more accessible Some foreign investors have become worried about rising credit defaults and poor liquidity in onshore corporate credit bonds in particular, but China’s regulators are alert and taking action The following article is a summary of insights from our 2021 Asia Conference. Learn more about investing in China In the world of fixed income, China is quickly drawing international interest and investment. Its bond market has been steadily opening up, which has led to the inclusion of China “rates” bonds – a category consisting of government bonds (CGBs) and policy bank bonds – in a number of major international bond indices. As a result, many investors are rapidly building their China exposure, albeit from a low base. Foreign ownership in China’s “onshore” bond market – bonds denominated in renminbi (RMB) – has doubled in less than three years, according to Yin Liu, who spoke at the Allianz Global Investors 2021 Asia Conference in June. Mr Liu is a senior director of international cooperation at China’s National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII)1. At the end of 2020, according to Mr Liu, foreigners owned RMB 3.25 trillion of the bonds traded on the China Interbank Bond Market (CIBM). That is equivalent to 3.23%,2 up from the June 2018 figure of 1.5%. What is attracting so much international investment? Some of the top factors are the attractive yield pick-up of Chinese bonds versus other markets, alongside ample monetary policy flexibility from China’s central bank. But the international investors recently drawn to Chinese bonds would not even be considering this asset classes without the steady stream of reforms that recently opened up the market. “This influx of foreign flows has been happening for two or three years,” explained Mr Liu. “It’s very profitable to invest in China. Further, the economy is stable, monetary policy is normal and we have ample tools to take care of any market turmoil. That’s the main backdrop for the foreign inflow of money. But we do a lot of work to support the foreign investors coming into the market.”. Opening up of the onshore bond market The work to make China’s onshore markets more accessible started over a decade ago (see accompanying timeline). Since 2011, a series of reforms allowed foreign investors increasing access to a wider range of fixed-income instruments in China’s onshore bond market. A milestone event was the introduction of China Interbank Bond Market (CIBM)3 Direct in 2016, which allowed foreign investors quota-free access to CIBM. All that was required was registration with the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and the appointment of an onshore custodian bank. Separately, in 2017, the introduction of the Bond Connect programme enabled trades to be settled via custodian banks in Hong Kong, further liberalising foreign investors’ market access to the mainland bond market through Hong Kong. As the market opened up, major global bond indices began to include CGBs and policy bank bonds, which further encouraged international investors. Most recently, FTSE Russell completed the inclusion of CGBs in its flagship FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI). The initial inclusion came in March 2021, at a 5.25% weighting. Market access regulations have relaxed in recent years Source: IPECapital, Data as of 30 September 2019. The above is for illustrative purposes only and is not a recommendation or advice to buy or sell any security. Past performance, or any prediction, projection or forecast, is not indicative of future performance. Looking forward Even as foreign investment has ramped up, some foreign investors have become worried about rising credit defaults and poor liquidity in corporate credit bonds in particular. On both topics, Mr Liu stressed that the regulators are alert and taking action. In the case of credit ratings, he cited the enforcement actions taken against local rating agencies, as well as the issuance of licences to international agencies S&P Global and Fitch Ratings. He also said that NAFMII was examining ways to improve liquidity in areas such as government bonds and repurchase agreements (repos). What Mr Liu made clear was that the regulators, led by the PBoC, were committed to continuing improving the market, listening to investors as they go. Giving an international investor’s view, David Tan, CIO Fixed Income Asia Pacific at Allianz Global Investors, said: “Recently, we've seen Asia grow tremendously and become a big part of most global equity portfolios. As a bond market investor myself, I see this trend also happening for the RMB bond market. I think it's just the beginning.” 1 NAFMII was founded under the approval of the State Council of China to aid the development of China’s over-the-counter (OTC) financial markets. These OTC markets include China’s inter-bank bond market and foreign exchange market, among others. 2 Sources: China Central Depositary & Clearing Co. Ltd.; Shanghai Clearing House. 3 CIBM is the main trading venue for Treasury, policy bank and commercial bank bonds accounting, accounting for 85% of the entire onshore bond market. Originally, foreign investors were allowed to invest in the CIBM under the QFII/RQFII market access schemes, following certain quotas. Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Credit risk reflects the issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal—the lower the rating, the higher the risk of default. Foreign markets may be more volatile, less liquid, less transparent, and subject to less oversight, and values may fluctuate with currency exchange rates; these risks may be greater in emerging markets.

Using AI to discover Asia’s environmental leaders 23/11/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The breadth, timeliness and consistency of artificial intelligence make it a powerful tool for identifying changes in environmental performance. Key takeaways AllianzGI has developed an AI “machine” that can unearth shifts in environmental performance far more quickly and accurately than ESG ratings agencies, which depend on human analysts The tool analyses the news flow from 12,000 sources, covering the companies and countries behind 35,000 to 40,000 assets Asset managers with technology that can gather insights ahead of the market can seek an advantage when incorporating environmental factors into investment decisions The following article is a summary of insights from our 2021 Asia Conference. Learn more about investing in China Speaking at the Allianz Global Investors 2021 Asia conference in June, Kunal Ghosh, CIO Systematic Strategies at AllianzGI, explained how we use artificial intelligence (AI) to uncover Asian investment opportunities related to environmental transformations. Our AI Environment Model incorporates an AI “machine” that sifts through thousands of news stories as they appear, aiming to unearth shifts in environmental performance far more quickly and accurately than humans can. The goal is to discover early evidence of environment-related transformations at a range of companies in Asia, including the identification of environmental leaders and laggards. Of course, keeping track of such a huge universe of securities is a colossal challenge. Using the entire global MSCI All Country World All Cap Index for illustration, Mr Ghosh pointed out that it encompassed about 15,000 companies. Yet just one of these firms, a multinational beverage company, was the subject of 1,300 environmental stories in a single month, each one of which could affect its environmental rating. “Front-running” the ratings agencies “In certain ways, you can think of our model as effectively allowing you to front-run the MSCI rating,” said Mr Ghosh. “As MSCI changes ratings and investors shift their allocations, you have the opportunity to take advantage by getting ahead of the environmental premium.” The model has been developed over the past two years, using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to uncover the “unstructured data” in environmental news stories. The news flow comes from 12,000 sources, covering the companies and countries behind 35,000 to 40,000 assets. Any environmental-related news associated with an asset – whether a sovereign bond, corporate bond or stock – can be identified, mapped and classified. And because the environmental score is awarded by a machine, it is naturally objective. This contrasts with the ratings agencies, where subjective opinions can lead to inconsistency. For instance, MSCI and Sustainalytics recently reached different opinions about an electric vehicle manufacturer’s environmental performance, despite having the same information. Valuable disagreement Often, the rating agencies and our AI model reach similar conclusions, but the model’s judgments are most valuable when opinions differ. For instance, our AI Environment model has awarded high scores to a Chinese real estate developer since its recent creation of a pioneering, ecologically sustainable model in Malaysia. More recently, in 2021, this developer has been in discussions to bring similar sustainable ideas to Japan. But MSCI has been slow to catch up, only giving the firm a high rating in March 2021. “We identified the ecologically sustainable city model that the developer was building in Malaysia and Japan,” noted Mr Ghosh. “MSCI was simply lagging; for a long time they gave the developer a poor rating. They have been known to be more than a year late in identifying positive environmental change.” Mr Ghosh also provided the example of a Singaporean multinational bank, which received a high AI Environment score for its carbon efficient operations and environmental lending activity. However, in June 2020, this opinion was at odds with the far more critical ESG (environmental, social and governance) rating from MSCI, given the bank’s history of lending to hydrocarbon mining projects. But MSCI had not registered that the bank had started improving its environmental financing activities. Nine months later, in March 2021, MSCI caught up and upgraded its view of the bank. AI unlocks an untapped opportunity AllianzGI’s AI Environment model can react to news much more quickly and accurately than ESG ratings agencies, which depend on human analysts. Unstructured, text-heavy data in news reports represents an untapped opportunity for asset managers with the technology to gather insights ahead of the market. Having a model that is broad, fast and objective offers an advantage when incorporating environmental factors into investment decisions. Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return.

       "  'content': \"Active is: Expanding the boundaries of investing Nine themes for investing in China’s transformation 08/11/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary As China’s economy quickly transforms itself, a thematic approach based on structural macro trends is an effective way to identify the winners. Key takeaways China is transforming into a high-tech leader, developing semiconductors, solar panels, artificial intelligence technology, biotechnology and dynamic new business models But only a small segment of companies will be “winners” – which is why investors may want to turn to a thematic approach as an effective way to participate in change We’ve defined a set of themes – including environmental commitment, healthcare transformation and food security – to help identify companies best positioned to profit from the country’s rapid transformation The following article is a summary of insights from our 2021 Asia Conference. Learn more about investing in China Only ten years ago, China had a reputation as the “workshop of the world” – a country where goods were not only mass-produced, but intellectual property was disregarded and products were copied. It was far from being the pioneering marketplace that it is now. In fact, China today leads the development of semiconductors, solar panels, artificial intelligence technology, biotechnology and dynamic new business models. At Allianz Global Investors’ June 2021 Asia Conference, one of the key topics was how China’s high-tech transformation has unfolded. Head of Thematic Equity Andreas Fruschki, Portfolio Manager Shibo Wang and Director of Research Terence Law explained how China has changed fundamentally. Patent filings within the country are outpacing those in North America by three to one. In terms of research and development investment, China ranks second in the world, just behind the US. In truth, China is transforming far faster than anywhere else in the world. Macroeconomic trends across several dimensions define its rapid evolution: strong economic growth, decarbonisation, urbanisation, technology innovation, deep industrialisation, increasing disposable income and demographic change. Taken together, these trends mean that China is likely to be as different 10 years from now as it was in 2010. The winning themes Just as at any time of rapid structural change, however, there are winners and losers. “Only a small segment of companies will be winners from China’s growth themes,” noted Mr Fruschki. “That is what you can identify with a thematic approach to investing. It’s a very effective way to participate in change.” Drilling down into China’s broad macro trends, Allianz Global Investors has defined a set of themes to help identify those companies best positioned to profit from the country’s rapid transformation. The current list of themes includes: Import substitution New consumption Environmental commitment Digital life Healthcare transformation Frontier technology Quality education Financial inclusion Food security Import substitution, the environment and consumption The first three themes in particular illustrate the emerging investment opportunities. For instance, “import substitution” describes the growing number of Chinese companies that are catching up with foreign competitors and taking market share. On a recent research trip, Mr Wang visited several companies along the semiconductor value chain, which are developing fast due to growing demand for chips. “The good news is that today it’s not just computers that need semiconductor chips, but also TVs, cleaning robots and the whole development of the internet of things,” he noted. “This offers a great opportunity for young Chinese semiconductor companies to finance their R&D spending.” Turning to new consumption, the pandemic’s aftermath is disproportionately favouring high-end Chinese brands instead of the old European favourites. “People are spending their money on high-end Chinese brands,” said Mr Wang. “Some of these companies are growing very fast, especially if they have innovative business models.” Another major theme is environmental commitment. In 2020, President Xi Jinping pledged that China would become carbon-neutral by 2060. Chinese businesses are already leading the global transition. China has the world’s largest market for electric vehicles, by far the biggest lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity and the largest usage of polysilicon for solar panels. “We believe that the journey to carbon neutrality will result in significant winners and losers,” explained Mr Wang. Like other countries throughout history, China is undergoing an economic revolution that will enrich the architects of change. What makes today’s China different, however, is the sheer pace of reinvention. The investor’s challenge is to identify the winners – a task that can be simplified by focusing on the country’s growth themes. Investing involves risk.

       "  'content': \"Growth. The China Way. Why China’s 2060 net-zero carbon goal matters today 07/10/2021 Summary Decarbonising a country that burns half of the world’s coal every year is a huge task. Yet the transition will bring investment opportunities in both “new-economy” and “old-economy” sectors. Key takeaways If China succeeds at becoming fully carbon-neutral by 2060, it would do more than help slow global warming: it would transform industries and supply chains around the world Transitioning to carbon neutrality would bring many benefits to China – including encouraging equitable, sustainable development Early movers in old-economy sectors could become tomorrow’s market leaders if they find new ways to support the transition away from fossil fuels The following article is a summary of insights from our 2021 Asia Conference. Learn more about investing in China When President Xi Jinping told the UN General Assembly in September 2020 that China would reach peak carbon emissions by 2030, and be fully carbon-neutral by 2060, his remarks drew great interest. China is an industrial powerhouse and the world’s biggest emitter of CO2 – bigger than the US, UK and EU combined.1 So if China manages to reach its goal, it would do more than help slow global warming. China’s success would transform industries and supply chains both at home and around the world. Even so, 2060 is almost 40 years away, and Mr Xi’s surprise announcement did not reveal any details of how this commitment would be achieved. As a result, some critics saw little reason to expect immediate change. Yet nothing could be further from the truth. Not only did the president’s statement mark the beginning of a long race to “net zero”, but changes are already happening surprisingly quickly. Carbon neutrality is a key part of China’s strategic transformation Mr Xi’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2060 means China is joining forces with other major economies to help cool a warming planet. At the same time, China’s pledge is about more than being a responsible global citizen, because carbon neutrality serves China’s long-term strategic interests on many fronts: China’s transition to clean energy will create new industries that drive economic growth. Carbon neutrality will also help China upgrade its domestic manufacturing capabilities and speed the development and adoption of advanced technologies. This is fully consistent with China’s aim for technological self-sufficiency in strategically important areas such as new energy, 5G and smart manufacturing. And it is even more important for China’s long-term security, given the backdrop of ongoing US-China geopolitical and technological tension. In addition, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles by China’s massive population would not only create domestic companies that are also global leaders, but it would help China reduce its dependency on imported oil and gas. China is the world’s largest importer of crude oil, accounting for approximately a quarter of the world’s total oil imports in 2020.2 Last but not least, achieving carbon neutrality could help foster more equitable, sustainable development within China This last point is particularly important given China’s new focus on “common prosperity”. For example, consider Northwest China. It is a geographical region that has historically been underdeveloped due to problems with water scarcity and poor transportation networks. Yet it is actually rich in wind and sunshine – two of the main ingredients for renewable energy generation. That’s why China is looking at improving this region’s infrastructure in a sustainable way. “If you think about first-tier Chinese cities such as, Shanghai, Guangdong and Shenzhen, many of them are along the coast,” explained Shannon Zheng, Senior Product Specialist, at Allianz Global Investors’ Asia Conference in June 2021. “So developing renewable energy in Northwest China can bring advanced industrial manufacturing capabilities – and all the ensuing economic benefits – to relatively underdeveloped regions. If done properly, this should help bridge inequalities between coastal and inland regions.” China’s ambitious targets start from a low base Although China has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions, it must make a significant effort to get there. That’s in large part because China’s current growth model still relies on burning fossil fuels, particularly in heavy industry. Coal is an abundant natural resource in China, which explains why coal accounts for about 60% of total power generation. Every year China burns half of all the coal used globally – primarily for energy generation, but also to make steel and cement. Indeed, China produces more than half of the world’s supply of these basic construction materials.3 Fortunately, China is already making some progress. Its ratio of CO2 emissions to GDP has been falling for at least 15 years.4 However, for China to fulfil Mr Xi’s pledge, it’s estimated that renewable energy – which includes solar, wind, hydro and nuclear energy – needs to account for 90% of the country’s generated power by 2045.5 That means solar energy generation capacity alone needs to increase by an estimated 16 times just to match up with the huge demand created by China’s massive economy. Low-carbon investment opportunities The good news for investors is that the enormous scale of China’s energy transition creates investment opportunities across a range of sectors. The solar industry, for instance, is looking more attractive as falling solar panel prices help make sun-generated power more competitive with fossil fuel-generated power. “The cost reduction over the past few years and the lower reliance on subsidies have turned the solar sector from a more technical, policy-driven sector to a more structural, fundamentals-driven sector,” says Allianz Global Investors Portfolio Manager Kevin You. “Which means that the solar sector is now more investable compared to a decade ago.” When it comes to cars, China’s government has announced its aim for electric vehicles to make up 20% of sales by 2025 and 40% by 2030. That should lead to investment opportunities along the supply chain, from battery materials to electronic parts, as well as many opportunities in the field of autonomous driving. Even old-economy heavy-industry companies, which may struggle to reduce their use of fossil fuels, will have opportunities. Mr You believes that early corporate movers in this area may emerge as tomorrow’s leaders. Already, there are examples of China’s steel makers exploring hydrogen-based steelmaking technology – which produces iron with hydrogen instead of coal – and improving their carbon-capture technologies. China’s huge push to reach carbon neutrality is more than just a slogan. It has imminent implications for China’s economy and financial markets, especially as Mr Xi’s 2030 target for peak emissions is close at hand. As momentum builds, select new-economy companies could experience helpful tailwinds, while old-economy companies that are willing to transform themselves may gain market share and grow into future leaders. 1Source: European Commission Joint Research Centre, Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research version 5.0, Allianz Global Investors.

       "  'content': \"China’s Phase 3: a new chapter in its epic story by Virginie Maisonneuve | 15/09/2021 Summary To understand current developments in China, it’s important to see how the country is now emphasising not just economic power, but the “soft” power of persuasion and influence. The key for investors is to learn how and where these strategic priorities will translate into opportunities. Key takeaways China’s recent clampdowns on the technology and education sectors have unnerved investors, but they don’t distract from the long-term investment case China has entered a new phase – jostling for influence on the global stage, addressing social issues at home, and striving for technology dominance This will take economic power and soft power – and a good place to start would be collaborating with other global powers on climate change solutions Investors everywhere have been unnerved by a flurry of negative news headlines out of China, but these should be seen in a wider context. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, and China appears to be in a reflective mood. The country is recommitting itself not just to continued economic success, but to focusing on a series of other concerns. These include addressing social concerns about inequality, tackling antitrust issues and curbing challenges to traditional centres of power. Efforts such as these are bound to stir up some volatility. Yet they are all part of a new phase in China’s evolution as the country repositions itself on the global stage. We expect China to continue using its economic power to elbow its way to the top ranks, while also beginning to exercise its “soft” powers of attraction and influence. So what should investors look for next? We think China will continue to pursue its own path of hybrid development, targeting self-sufficiency while becoming a best-in-class high-tech leader. But China also wants to continue to engage with the rest of the world and maintain the success of its financial markets. And we could see China collaborating with other global powers on common challenges – most notably on climate change – in a way that lets China write a positive new story. The three phases of China’s transformation To find out where China is headed, it’s helpful to look back on how far the country has come in a short time – which we separate into three distinct phases: Phase 1 began in earnest 20 years ago with China’s membership in the World Trade Organization. Abiding by WTO rules and committing to economic reforms helped China quickly become an essential link in the global supply chain – the “factory of the world”. The result was foreign direct investment that increased from USD 47 billion in 2001 to USD 163 billion in 2020 (source: UNCTAD). Phase 2 came when China supplanted Japan as the world’s No. 2 economy in 2010, after the global financial crisis. By overtaking a country famed for its technology, China moved from a manufacturer of cheap goods to a high-tech leader higher up the value chain. Also in Phase 2, China began integrating its financial markets into the global system – for example, with the Stock Connect and Bond Connect programmes that gave foreign investors easier access to Chinese markets. More recently, Chinese equities have been added to some of the most prominent global stock indices. This reflects the growing importance of China to the global markets, but even so, the percentage allocated to China by these benchmarks underplays China’s global influence. Phase 3 is the newest part of China’s transformation journey. President Xi Jinping is presiding over an economy set to overtake the US as the world’s biggest economy by 2029. China’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic provided a big boost, even if overall growth will trend slower than it has in recent years. But this phase is arguably the toughest one for China to get right. China must walk a tightrope as it manages its economic might, focuses on its social-equality “mandate” and hones its soft-power skills. China’s political system, combined with its domestic and global economic stature, will make this a uniquely challenging balancing act – both for itself and the world. Yet China’s success is critical to the world’s stability over the next decade. The economic and social components of Phase 3 The foundation of Phase 3 is continued economic success. To succeed, China must safeguard its economic prosperity and growth while keeping at bay global geopolitical tensions. China may have hoped that the US sanctions introduced by the previous president, Donald Trump, would be lifted by his successor, but President Joe Biden has proved as tough on China – he’s just less vocal about it. At the core of US-China tensions is an ongoing “digital Darwinism” – a multi-decade global power race based on the integration of technology and artificial intelligence in a world threatened by climate change. As the US-China relationship deteriorated and sanctions increased, threatening China's place in the world, China’s “dual circulation” strategy became even more significant. This strategy calls for a boost in Chinese consumer spending to help reduce China’s dependence on foreign trade, while promoting its manufacturing capacity worldwide and targeting a systematic reduction of its vulnerabilities. Interestingly, China might shift its focus from a US-style growth model – powered mostly by services and consumption – to a more balanced model, like Germany’s or Japan’s. In this model, industrial policy is a critical driver of long-term growth. If China can continue building up its high-tech manufacturing capabilities, it would help address some of the country’s most obvious vulnerabilities in a world where trade tensions restrict the ability to transfer technologies from one country or entity to another. It should also help boost innovation to a new level. Focus areas will likely include semiconductors, where China consumes 35% of the global supply yet manufactures only 10%. “National champions” are set to emerge – companies that can support import substitution and drive China’s global competitive advantage. Capabilities that promote national security, data, innovation and technology advancement will be prioritised. The other component of China’s Phase 3 is a renewed focus on social issues in ways that are entirely consistent with its Communist system. China is doubling down on its efforts to promote growth that is equitable and more sustainable, and to project a positive vision of China globally. It is here where China has been the subject of negative news headlines that added to market volatility: China is trying to “reset” its education sector, attempting to reform a culture that places overwhelming pressure on students to perform. Educational costs and stress have been soaring, exacerbating social inequality while failing to produce the types of students that the country needs in future. The Chinese authorities have taken action to redress the balance. China is also reviewing the “rules of the game” in the technology sector. This is driven by an understanding of the strategic importance of data in an “internet of things” world powered by artificial intelligence. But this sector’s success has also created new power bases and many billionaires, which could over time challenge the existing “Chinese way” and its traditional centres of power. China: what’s next for investors? As an emerging economy, China can be volatile, but understanding China’s long-term strategy can put this volatility in perspective.

Manage My Cookie Preferences A good time for China’s critics to take a deep breath For all the concern about the market impact of the Chinese authorities’ actions, it is worth noting a few important reminders: While many in the West have expressed dismay at China’s recent high-tech clampdown, big tech is in the crosshairs of other governments around the world. Authorities in the US, China and many countries in Europe are addressing the tech sector’s alleged anti-competitive practices and trying to foster an “orderly” development of the “Web 3.0” world. In China, this is considered critical to securing its global influence and domestic order. China’s government has fostered the success of its financial markets over many years, and it will be reluctant to kill the “golden goose”. To worry that the renewed emphasis on social and economic governance will create a weight on growth misses one of the key points: the next phase of China’s emergence on the world stage will be as much about its soft power as its economic power – the two are symbiotic – as the country seeks to build a more sustainable path for itself. Climate change presents an opportunity for international collaboration There is perhaps no better opportunity than climate change for China to write a positive new chapter in its history. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report describes a planet on the brink of disaster if no decisive action is taken. China has set out ambitious decarbonisation goals, but achieving them will be no easy task, as emerging economies have typically depended heavily on fossil fuels. But the environmental “Kuznets curve” hypothesis offers some reassurance. This states that as a country’s economy develops, the environment generally worsens until the country reaches a specific average income. But after that point, capital can then be invested back into the environment and the ecosystem can gradually be restored. As the world’s two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, the US and China need to work together on solutions. Indeed, China is a necessary partner in the fight against climate change. The April 2021 US-China joint statement bodes well: US climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua committed to work together to strengthen implementation of the Paris Agreement. Perhaps this climate emergency will be the global rallying cry that fosters some geopolitical stability and collaboration at a time of momentous global change. What does this mean for investors? For investors seeking to understand current developments in China, it’s essential to know where China has come from and how its policy agenda is evolving. This also applies when picking stocks. While bottom-up analysis is essential, an understanding of the broader context (including what drives domestic policy within China’s layered and intricate political framework) is critical in China – perhaps more there than in any other country. This insight enables investors to learn how and where the country’s strategic priorities will translate into opportunities. It won’t be smooth sailing: China’s capital markets have always been volatile, with large swings both up and down. This is unlikely to change. The US and China will fight it out in a Darwinian race for digital leadership where the combination of large amounts of accessible data and artificial intelligence creates new sources of power. And closer to home, China’s “national champions” will shift over time as China adjusts its social priorities. We believe active management is essential – both to navigate this environment and to use the inevitable volatility to build positions. For example, we see opportunities in sectors linked to China’s strategic need for self-sufficiency (semiconductors), the industrial upgrade cycle (enhanced use of robotics), and stocks linked to China’s carbon-emissions targets (renewable energy and the electric vehicle supply chain). Using passive instruments to invest in China may not be sufficient, given the need to navigate this market at a deeper level. But investors who accept that volatility will always be a characteristic of Chinese markets may be able to see China’s long-term vision more clearly: as that of an essential player on the world’s stage.

Volatility goes hand in hand with China’s higher long-term return potential. Understanding the dynamics at play can help make these changes easier to take in stride. Expand All Collapse All Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email 1. China equities have always exhibited higher volatility – and attractive returns Investing in China brings different risks and greater unpredictability compared with Western markets. The Chinese government’s recent clampdown on tech firms and education companies illustrates this point. But investors have historically been rewarded with long-term outperformance. Indeed, an investment in the MSCI China Index from January 2000 to the end of August 2021 would have generated a 402% return. In the past, moments of volatility like this have proved to be buying opportunities for many long-term investors.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. 2. China’s equity market offers multiple options for investment There are many ways for investors to buy shares of Chinese companies. This has become even more important during China’s recent regulatory clampdown, which affected some listings – particularly US-listed American depositary receipts (ADRs) and select Hong Kong-listed companies – more than others. With China A-shares constituting almost 70% of China’s total market capitalisation size, China’s capital markets are much broader and deeper than many investors realise.

The total figures are for comparison only. The stocks included may be listed in more than one exchange. Offshore China stocks are defined based on companies with ultimate parent domiciled in China. Suspended stocks, investment funds and unit trusts are excluded. 3. China’s A-shares were less affected by recent volatility The regulatory clampdown on tech giants and education firms didn’t affect China A-shares as much as other listings. It’s another reasons for investors to explore the broad universe of Chinese equities – regardless of where the stocks are listed. Internet, education and ecommerce stocks tend to be better represented in Hong Kong-listed stocks and US-listed ADRs (American depositary receipts). A-shares (stocks of Chinese companies listed on exchanges in Shanghai or Shenzhen) tend to feature more companies in sectors such as industrials, healthcare and consumer goods.

Chinese stocks don’t move in lockstep with other equity markets China’s equity markets are appreciated for their long-term potential for outperformance, but they’re also useful as a portfolio-diversification tool. China A-shares have a correlation of 0.32 with global equities over the last 10 years, which means they move in different directions almost 70% of the time. (In comparison, US and global equities have a correlation of 0.97.) Holding A-shares in a global portfolio may help generate a better risk-return profile.

Past performance is not indicative of future performance. 5. Foreign investors are still buying China equities, despite recent turmoil Despite the negative news out of China, global investors have continued to add China A-shares to their portfolios. August 2021 marked the ninth consecutive month of positive flows for this share class, suggesting a “buy the dip” mentality. The Chinese government recently helped lay the groundwork for greater cross-border investment with the launch of the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect schemes in 2014 and 2016, respectively: In “southbound” trades, mainland China residents use the Shanghai or Shenzhen exchanges to buy Hong Kong-listed stocks. Investors outside of mainland China can use the Hong Kong exchange to buy A-shares in Shanghai or Shenzhen (known as a “northbound” trade).

Major global indices are adding large numbers of Chinese stocks In a sign of China’s growing integration into global financial markets, major stock indices have been adding more Chinese stocks – reflecting the increasing importance of China to the global financial system. But China’s representation in these indices still underplays the country’s significant economic potential. Investors may want to consider allocating more to China than benchmarks do.

Innovation and transformation: key drivers of China’s growth China has come a long way in a short time. Once known as the “factory of the world”, it shifted away from low-cost manufacturing towards the high-tech areas that are essential to its growth – and, crucially, its desire for self-sufficiency. A rapidly expanding middle class, increasing domestic consumption, high-tech innovation and a commitment to a carbon-free economy are all key parts of the China growth story.

Steady reforms, an increasingly internationalised currency and attractive yields are resulting in increased inflows. Read these nine tips to understand the essentials of investing in China’s fixed-income marketplace. Expand All Collapse All Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email 1. There are three main ways to access China’s bond markets China’s fixed-income marketplace isn’t monolithic, but it is massive. The onshore RMB segment alone is bigger than those in France, Germany and the UK combined. Three different investable markets for Chinese bonds 2. China’s currency has several names, but “renminbi” is arguably more important for bond investors Outside of Asia, “yuan” is generally the term used to describe China’s currency. But “renminbi” (abbreviation: RMB) is the official legal name of China’s currency, and the term used the most in China and in Asia overall. Bond investors should be aware of the two kinds of renminbi used in financial transactions. In “onshore” China (sometimes called mainland China), transactions are done using the onshore traded renminbi (abbreviation: CNY). This is where “onshore RMB”/“onshore CNY” bonds get their name. In “offshore” regions (those outside of mainland China), transactions are done using the offshore traded renminbi (abbreviation: CNH). This is where “offshore RMB”/“offshore CNH” bonds get their name. China’s regulators are intent upon making the onshore RMB currency (the CNY) a more “internationalised” one – similar to how the US dollar (USD) is used around the world to conduct transactions. That makes the onshore RMB bond market increasingly important. Key renminbi facts for fixed-income investors 3. China’s onshore RMB bond market is large and growing The total value of China’s onshore RMB bond market reached USD 15.5 trillion at the end of 2020, and many market participants are expecting the market to grow significantly in the coming years. China’s onshore RMB bond market is also diverse, with three main segments of the market: money market instruments, “rates” and “credits”. Rates bonds form the largest segment of the onshore RMB market (55% as at 30 June 2020). This group broadly consists of central government bonds (CGBs), local government bonds (LGBs) and bonds from policy financial banks (PFBs, which are large financial institutions owned by the Chinese government). Credit bonds encompass issues from government-linked financing entities, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), financial institutions (such as banks and insurers) and privately owned (non-government) corporations. Credits make up about a quarter of the onshore RMB market. Money market instruments issued by banks and corporations make up the rest of the onshore RMB bond market. Outstanding bonds by market Source: Chinabond, Chinaclear, Wind, Standard Chartered Research. Data as at 30 June 2020. 4. The creditworthiness of onshore RMB bonds can vary widely When investing in the onshore RMB bond market, it’s important to work with a partner who can help you assess the creditworthiness of an issuer. The credit quality of bonds issued by LGBs, SOEs and private companies can vary widely. Moreover, China’s onshore credit rating system differs from international rating conventions. For example, onshore bonds rated AA+ would typically be rated as “high yield” on an international scale. Onshore RMB bonds’ breakdown by credit rating Source: Wind, Standard Chartered Research. Data as at 30 June 2020. 5. Foreign ownership of RMB bonds is rising China has been making it easier for non-mainland China investors to access to its domestic capital markets. This has paved the way for Chinese bonds to be included in global benchmark indices – with the latest being the FTSE Russell WGBI in November 2021. China is also working to make the renminbi a more “internationalised” currency. Together, these factors should help international investors’ holdings of RMB bonds to rise over time. But international investors still own less than 3% (about USD 540 billion) of the entire RMB bond market. This is significantly lower than the 10%-25% foreign bond ownership range observed in other emerging-market nations. It is also lower than China’s representation in major global bond indices. This indicates that foreign interest will likely keep growing in the coming years. Foreign ownership of China bonds Source: CEIC, WIND, Citi Research. Data as at 31 January 2021. 6. Rising demand for the RMB may help RMB-denominated bonds to appreciate in value over time In recent years, governments and companies have grown increasingly comfortable using the renminbi to conduct international transactions. This can help these institutions eliminate currency risk, since one currency doesn’t need to be exchanged for the other – a process that can cause fluctuations in value. Another factor making the renminbi attractive to international investors is the way China’s central bank – the People’s Bank of China, or PBoC – has resumed using conventional tools (such as adjusting the short-term interest rate) to enact its monetary policy. Compare this with the unconventional tools that other large central banks are using, such as the massive bond purchases known as “quantitative easing”. Some investors consider these tools to be less sustainable and possibly riskier. That makes the PBoC’s more conventional approach – and China’s renminbi – more attractive to many international investors. As the international community turns to the renminbi, there should be a corresponding need for investors to seek investment assets denominated in renminbi. This may help lift the value of RMB bonds over time, which would likely benefit investors who already own these bonds.

Onshore bonds can bring diversification benefits Onshore RMB bonds have exhibited low correlations to other asset classes. Case in point: onshore RMB bonds moved in the same direction as global bonds only 22% of the time. As a result, holding onshore RMB bonds in a global portfolio may improve overall diversification. 3-year return correlation of onshore RMB bonds vs other major asset classes Source: Bloomberg. Data as at 31 December 2020. 8. Adding onshore RMB bonds can enhance the risk/return profile of investors’ portfolios Over time, the returns of onshore RMB bonds have been steady. Moreover, their volatility has remained low, meaning there have been relatively few large swings either up or down. When these two metrics are taken together, they can be expressed as a “risk/return” profile. And as the accompanying chart shows, onshore RMB bonds have an attractive risk/return profile compared with other major asset classes. That can make onshore RMB bonds a helpful addition to a range of portfolios. 3-year risk/return profile (in USD) Source: Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 31 March 2021.

China’s onshore bonds offer added yield potential in today’s low-yield environment Interest rates in developed economies have been low or even negative for some time. This has contributed to low to negative yields for many types of bonds, as the accompanying chart shows. Moreover, given that the global economic environment continues to be somewhat weak, we expect interest rates to remain at the suppressed levels for some time. That makes it all the more important for investors to pursue sufficient sources of yield potential. Onshore RMB Chinese government bonds (CGBs) have a higher yield than most developed-market government bonds. Moreover, CGBs offer an average credit rating of A+. That means investing in CGBs can provide investors with solid credit quality and attractive additional yields. 5-year government bond nominal yields Source: Bloomberg, Markit IBoxx, JP Morgan, Allianz Global Investors.

Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Credit risk reflects the issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal—the lower the rating, the higher the risk of default. Emerging markets may be more volatile, less liquid, less transparent, and subject to less oversight, and values may fluctuate with currency exchange rates.

       "  'content': \"China: the “sleeping giant” of the equity markets 14/04/2021 Summary Despite the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing global slowdown, 2020 was a watershed year for China in many ways. William Russell, Global Head of Product Specialists Equity, explains how China is delivering on its long-term strategy and what opportunities this can provide for investors. Key takeaways China should no longer be considered an emerging market – rather, it’s on the way to becoming a global powerhouse China aims to be the world’s high-tech standard-bearer, thanks to major investments in 5G infrastructure, digitisation, semiconductors and artificial intelligence US-China trade tensions are likely to continue, which is one reason China is increasingly focusing on establishing its autonomy, strengthening supply chains and forging new alliances China is underrepresented in many benchmark indices considering the size of its economy and markets, so investors focusing exclusively on benchmarks may be investing too little in China China is taking off while the West is still dealing with the coronavirus crisis. Why is China’s economy so strong? William Russell: Without a doubt, Covid-19 has been the main risk to economic growth worldwide – and that applies to China as well. During the first quarter of 2020, the country was hit hard by the pandemic and growth suffered a lot. But while most Western countries, including the United States and the European Union, are still struggling to end the pandemic, China and many other Asian countries appear to be in a better position. China has made significant progress containing the virus, which has helped lay the foundation for robust growth. And the long-term success story is very likely to continue as well. What makes you so sure of that? William Russell: There are several factors driving China’s success. One is that China has enviable structural conditions – including positive demographic trends, healthy consumer behaviour and rising incomes. For example, the spending power of millennials in China is very different today as a result of their growing wealth. Another success factor is that China is focusing on economic issues with enormous growth potential – such as intensively promoting robotics and improving its renewable-energy supply. In addition, China is striving to be the world’s high-tech standard-bearer and the government is pursuing major investments in areas such as 5G infrastructure, digitisation, semiconductors and artificial intelligence. These will be the backbone of the country’s future growth model. And it is these sorts of developments that mean China should no longer be considered an emerging market – rather, it’s on the way to becoming a global powerhouse. So government investment programmes continue to be a major force behind the recovery? William Russell: China’s economic policy and investment projects will naturally continue to be heavily influenced by the government. But one very noticeable feature last year was that China’s economic policy was a lot more conventional than that of many Western countries. This is because of the experience back in 2009 after the global financial crisis, when China launched a huge fiscal programme that resulted in high levels of debt. In China, this is now widely recognised as a mistake. So as we look ahead, it is very likely that as the Chinese economy gathers momentum, the government will take prudent steps to reduce the level of policy support and investment spending in order to prevent a further build-up of leverage. Good trade relations with other countries are an important condition for further growth. Do you think there are positive signs on this front? William Russell: In recent years, China’s relationship with the United States has been problematic. We think it is unlikely these tensions will ease significantly, even if the tone of the rhetoric becomes less confrontational. After all, being tough on China was one of the few things US politicians could agree on in the recent election. This is one reason why China is increasingly focusing on establishing its autonomy, strengthening supply chains, developing modern manufacturing facilities and forging new alliances. For example, the new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is creating an economic bloc of Asia-Pacific countries that is home to around one-third of the world’s population. In addition, after seven years of negotiations, the EU and China recently announced a comprehensive investment treaty: the Comprehensive Investment Agreement (CAI). This represents a strategic breakthrough for China and could also help China enter into new international partnerships. The trend towards greater sustainability is playing a bigger and bigger role internationally. What does that mean to China? William Russell: Interest in sustainability is growing fast in China. The country recently announced a pledge to be carbon-neutral by 2060. Although this sounds like a long way away, in practice there is immediate pressure on many companies – especially the largest carbon emitters – to accelerate plans towards reducing their carbon footprints. For example, substantial investments are being made in renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, hydrogen technology and other “clean technologies”. China is already the largest market for electric vehicles globally and has also taken the lead in solar installations. More broadly, China is significantly upping its game in areas such as corporate governance and reporting. Many companies now have employee share-option schemes, which provide a stronger alignment with their shareholders. Of course, there is still a long way to go – and above all, there needs to be greater transparency for investors. But the direction of travel is very encouraging. So how can investors benefit from China’s continued rise? William Russell: The most direct way is through investing in China’s equity markets. Over the last 20 years (to 31 Dec 2020), the benchmark MSCI China Index has returned 521% compared with MSCI Europe’s 98%. Historically most global investors have had relatively little direct exposure to China equities, and especially the mainland China A-share markets. One reason for this is that China has been – and continues to be – underrepresented in many indices considering the size and scale of its economy and financial markets. As a result, investors focusing exclusively on the benchmark may be investing too little in China, relatively speaking. For example, according to estimates by the International Monetary Fund, China accounted for more than 16% of global GDP in 2019, surpassing the EU's 15.4%. Yet China currently only makes up around 5% of the MSCI All Country World Index (MSCI ACWI) – the main benchmark for global stocks. Does this mean China is still the “sleeping giant” of the equity market? William Russell: Absolutely. There are good reasons why China has been underrepresented in global indices. For example, it was only quite recently that mainland China’s stockmarkets – the so-called A-shares – became easily accessible to foreign investors. However, with the continued opening up of these markets, China’s weighting in these indices should increase. Realistically, for example, China’s share of the MSCI ACWI can be expected to double – getting it closer to the euro-zone’s share. Indeed, over time, we think investors will come to think of China as a standalone asset class like the US or Japan. In addition, China’s citizens have been investing more of their assets in their domestic equity markets, a trend that should also continue as the country’s saving culture evolves. What risks do you see? William Russell: In the short term, we would not be surprised to see a period of consolidation in China’s equity markets. They have rallied strongly over the last year and some profit-taking would be entirely natural. In addition, as China takes prudent steps to normalise monetary policy, the very strong liquidity environment may become more moderate. In fact we think some pullback would be a healthy development and help to set a more solid foundation for the future. Over the longer term, we continue to see compelling reasons to invest into China. It is, of course, a relatively volatile asset class, so it’s important for investors to have a long-term perspective and consider their comfort level with drawdowns. What are you hoping for from China in 2021? William Russell: We have seen some incredible innovation in China in recent years – including the use of artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis to overcome an acute shortage of doctors. There have also been major steps forward in genetics and research into cancer-drug development. And we’ve seen technological developments in solar energy that push some production costs below those of fossil fuels. My hope is that we see further progress in these and other areas, and that these can be shared to benefit the rest of the world – rather than kept in silos as part of the overall shift towards deglobalisation. 1594837 Download PDF\"},\n",

Key takeaways China’s new STAR market has been billed as the country’s answer to the Nasdaq – the technology-focused US exchange Its listing rules make it easier for the country’s tech and science startups to list domestically, thereby supporting the fast-growing sectors that are driving China’s growth Since opening in July 2019 with 25 listings, the STAR market now comprises almost 200 firms – and nearly 500 are in the IPO pipeline. Once famed as the world’s low-cost manufacturer, China has spent much of the last decade positioning itself to better compete with high-quality foreign peers across the value chain. The government has sought to establish China at the cutting edge of technological advances, especially in the areas of biotech, information technology, healthcare, and robotics – and as a manufacturer of the components necessary to support those fields. In doing so, it has begun a new chapter in its growth story. To drive further growth in these areas and encourage companies to list onshore, China launched a new exchange on its Shanghai stock market in June 2019. Billed as China’s answer to Nasdaq, the STAR market is specifically designed to house companies in high-tech and strategic emerging sectors, and to facilitate funding to these firms. What the STAR market offers Before the STAR market’s launch, all Chinese A-shares were listed on one of the three boards that made up the Shanghai and Shenzhen-based stock exchanges. The new STAR market aims to streamline the IPO process for innovative growth companies, using a flexible and transparent registration model. The market has no minimum profitability requirement for listing companies, supporting those organisations which may take time to realise a commercial profit, such as those in the biopharmaceutical space. As detailed in Table 1, the STAR market also introduces a new approach to pricing mechanism, investor eligibility and delisting rules, selectively lifting best practices from stock exchanges in the US, Hong Kong and Singapore. The existing A-shares markets that have provided the platform for China’s growth story so far could also follow the STAR market’s lead, and any further liberalisation of China’s capital markets – driving greater institutional participation – would likely encourage more Chinese firms to list domestically instead of on US exchanges. Such a trend should reduce the risk premium for all China A-shares over time. TABLE 1: How STAR market addresses the existing Chinese boards’ inefficiencies STAR market Current China A-Shares (Shanghai & Shenzhen Mainboard, SME and Chinext) Listing criteria Companies without profitability track record are allowed Dual share class with different voting rights allowed VIE structure allowed Registration-based, transparent process Minimum total profitability, revenue and assets requirement Dual share class and VIE structures not allowed Approval-based IPO process Pricing mechanism Market-based pricing, no implicit cap Implicit pricing cap around 23 x price to earnings Trading mechanism +/- 20% daily price limit +/- 10% daily price limit Investor eligibility Encourage participation of institutional investors; higher entry barrier for retail investors Only QFII and RQFII allowed All investors can participate Hot IPOs very often have 90% allocated to retail individuals Full access for RQFII and QFII investors; partial access for Stock Connect investors Delisting rules Better defined de-listing rules, stricter implementation Poor implementation of delisting rules The STAR market has quickly become established Investors and companies alike have so far been quick to embrace the STAR market. After launching in July 2019 with 25 names, the market had grown to 215 listed companies by January 2021. There are currently around 500 firms at different stages of the IPO registration pipeline. What’s more, stocks listed on the STAR market are steadily becoming more accessible to non-Chinese investors, offering a new route into the tech startups behind the country’s growth story. The FTSE already has plans in place to include the STAR market in its share indices, although MSCI – the world’s primary index provider – has not yet detailed how it will treat the new market. While the STAR market has had a relatively big impact in a short space of time, it has further to go to become an established fixture for investors. There were liquidity concerns in the market’s early days, particularly around larger IPOs soaking up available capital, but by and large the market has functioned smoothly. Even so, stocks listed on the STAR market are not yet eligible for the Stock Connect scheme – which makes A-shares more easily available to western investors – so many global institutional investors will not be able to participate. Chinese regulators are set to keep a close eye on the STAR market, given its combination of a lighter regulatory framework and likely increased volatility due to the high-risk early-stage companies that populate the market. Putting a value on these companies will also test the valuation methodologies of brokers and investors alike. But despite these challenges, the STAR market has enjoyed a rapid expansion so far, and the pipeline of potential new admissions bodes well for the future of this market – and the resulting opportunities for global investors to access some of the most innovative Chinese firms. 1473397'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Active is: Expanding the boundaries of investing How a new trading bloc signals a gravitational shift eastward by Stefan Scheurer | 15/12/2020 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The recently announced Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will likely enhance China’s continued growth story – and will help boost global GDP. Key takeaways The new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) creates an economic bloc of Asia-Pacific nations, covering a third of the world’s population The deal will apply to almost 30% of global trade and GDP – more than either the European Union or the US-Mexico-Canada agreement By bolstering China and creating more efficient supply chains within Asia, the RCEP will contribute to boosting global GDP over the coming decade Against a backdrop of ongoing US-China tensions, the RCEP could strengthen Asian member nations Following eight years of negotiations, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was officially signed by 15 Asia-Pacific countries in November 2020. Significantly, it creates a new economic bloc that covers about a third of the world’s population, and almost a third of global GDP and trade. To put this in context, it is bigger than both the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the European Union. The pact will progressively remove both tariff and non-tariff barriers on trade in both goods and services. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, it will lower tariffs on imports by up to 90% within 20 years. On top of this, the RCEP also sets common trade rules within the bloc. The RCEP unites the 10 members of ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) – which first proposed the RCEP idea about a decade ago – along with China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand as free trade agreement (FTA) partners. Chinese growth will have global impact China is likely to benefit strongly from the deal, as it will face fewer barriers to exports into the rest of Asia. But other members within the RCEP may benefit even more. The ASEAN countries, together with South Korea and Japan, will likely find it easier to build their value chains. According to a recent report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Japan and South Korea are also the two countries most likely to benefit in real GDP terms, each enjoying a near 1% boost to GDP. China and ASEAN members meanwhile are forecast to see a smaller 0.3% impact. The report also predicts that by 2030, the RCEP will boost global GDP by USD 186 billion. What does this mean for investors? The RCEP represents an important step towards broader regional integration within Asia, helping to strengthen the regional supply chain over the medium-term and setting the stage for closer economic integration. This translates into several key implications for investors: The RCEP should foster deeper trade integration – and bring associated economic benefits. As a result, the systems involved in a cross-border production network will likely become more flexible, helping to enhance productivity, accelerate structural shifts and spur growth across the region in the medium term. The closer relationship between trade and investment is expected to deepen financial market integration in the Asia-Pacific region. This should help ensure China’s trade with ASEAN member nations continues to outpace trade with other regions. ASEAN members will likely become further integrated into China’s supply chain. The world’s dependence on Asia – and mainland China in particular – for components of all sorts, has only increased; simplified trade will mean both Chinese and US importers may import more from third parties such as ASEAN member states. A unified “rules of origin” system under the RCEP should help reduce time and transaction costs as producers need fill out only one document to certify the origin of their products. This could also encourage firms to outsource some production to other countries within the RCEP for cost savings. Perhaps most significantly, the RCEP signals that Asia is moving ahead with trade liberalisation. And from a global perspective, it reinforces the trend of the world’s centre of economic gravity continuing to shift eastward.

China’s GDP growth will help other Asian economies to different degrees, but virus containment is key China’s growth has rebounded sharply following the first-quarter downturn prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic (see Chart 1). We believe China’s recovery will continue, though at a more moderate pace than was seen in 2Q20. The successful containment of the outbreak was the biggest factor in sustaining a functioning economy, though the government’s swift and targeted stimulus measures also helped. We think the Chinese authorities will continue to keep interest rates low and implement other accommodative policy measures to support a steady economic recovery, though rates may not move much lower. China’s ongoing recovery should be good news for several other Asian economies – primarily those that are most closely linked to China and have had similar success in containing Covid-19. Chart 1: China’s growth rebounded sharply in 2Q20 Source: NBS, CEIC, AllianzGI Economics & Strategy, as at June 2020. Hong Kong and Taiwan are likely to benefit most from mainland China’s recovery According to the Trade-in-Value-Added database compiled by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and WTO (World Trade Organization), 9.6% of Hong Kong’s GDP is generated by demand from mainland China. This means a 10% increase in mainland Chinese demand, everything else being equal, would likely lift Hong Kong’s GDP by just under 1 percentage point. The sensitivity of Taiwan’s GDP to mainland Chinese demand is even higher. As Chart 2 shows, a recovery in domestic demand in mainland China would likely benefit economies like Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea the most. This is thanks to the close trade links in goods and services that these economies have established with mainland China relative to the size of their own GDPs. For example, China imports from South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia many technological items such as semiconductors and other intermediate components which underpin its rapid technological advances, and much of Hong Kong’s revenue from tourism and trade services comes from mainland China.

India and Indonesia may see less of a benefit from China’s rebound, especially since the number of Covid-19 cases is still growing in both Domestically oriented economies such as India and Indonesia are relatively less sensitive to a recovery in Chinese domestic demand. This is because of the comparatively smaller weight of trade with mainland China-as a proportion of their own GDP. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic isn’t yet abating in India, Indonesia and the Philippines (see Chart 3). This is subduing economic activity.; Chart 3: India, Indonesia and the Philippines are still seeing rising Covid-19 infections Covid-19 confirmed cases to date Source: Johns Hopkins University, Morgan Stanley Research, AllianzGI Economics & Strategy, as at July 2020. Thailand and Malaysia rely on tourism, which will take time to return to usual levels Both the Thai and Malaysian economies have so far controlled Covid-19 better than their peers, successfully flattening the new infection curves. But we do not expect a swift recovery since both Thailand and Malaysia rely greatly on tourism (see Chart 4) – a sector that is likely to continue to be hampered as a result of reduced international travel. Chart 4: Thailand and Malaysia rely greatly on tourism revenues Source: CEIC, HSBC, AllianzGI Economics & Strategy, as at December 2019. South Korea and Taiwan are in a much better position than their south Asian peers thanks to their progress so far in controlling Covid-19 and their economies’ focus on technology exports Export growth has been recovering faster than anticipated, due to the world’s increased reliance on technology during the pandemic. The increase in working from home has helped drive demand for servers, laptops and other communication technology products (see Chart 5). Chart 5: South Korea and Taiwan’s exports are supported by technology products Electronics & Electronic product exports (% yoy, 3mmav) Source: CEIC, AllianzGI Economics & Strategy, as at June 2020. Investment implications In equities, consider North Asia over South and South-East Asia We suggest staying overweight in North Asian equity markets (mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea) versus the South and South-East Asian markets (India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia). The fact that the North Asian economies were typically more advanced in containing Covid-19 is key. Assuming there is no second-wave outbreak, these economies are likely to be at the end stage of the pandemic, moving towards economic recovery. We remain cautious on South and South-East Asian economies, in particularly India, Indonesia and the Philippines, as they are still fighting the spread of Covid-19. Keeping growth going may require increased fiscal stimulus, which will put pressure on central banks to deliver. Persistent growth is likely to require greater fiscal stimulus support, which in turn puts pressure on central banks to ease excessively and help finance government bond issuance. In fixed income, consider more exposure to Asian corporate credit for better yield enhancement With the very strong stimulus responses from the Fed and the resumption of growth in Asia, we think the risk of credit defaults in Asia should reduce considerably. This may prompt corporate credit spreads to tighten much more than sovereign and quasi-sovereign credit spreads, which we think have pretty much priced in the current circumstances. 1296538'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Active is: Seizing the China opportunity Growth in China set to outlast the pandemic and trade wars by Anthony Wong | 17/06/2020 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Despite the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and continuing tensions with the US, China remains on course to become the world’s largest economy by 2030. This could represent the coming decade’s most transformative development in global financial markets – and a major opportunity for investors. Key takeaways While it has been a challenging year so far, we expect China to resume its growth trajectory and become the world’s largest economy by 2030 The previously export-led Chinese economy is shifting its focus to higher-value, tech-driven sectors, with growth fuelled by the country’s burgeoning middle class Improved accessibility, governance and transparency have increased the appeal of Chinese A-shares to foreign investors Many indices underplay China’s growth story; a lack of exposure to China could mean benchmark investors miss out As the world combats the coronavirus and confronts what many believe will be an epic recession, investors need to find new sources of growth potential. We think one answer is to look towards China – in particular, China’s A-share equity markets. Investing in China is not without risks or controversy. China and the US are embroiled in a long-running trade dispute, and the coronavirus has added another dimension to existing tensions. The outbreak also slowed China’s growth, just as it has impacted growth in the rest of the world. But the fact remains that China may be a fundamentally attractive investment opportunity for three key reasons: it has opened its markets to foreign investment, it offers compelling growth stories for investors, and it is executing a strategy to become the world’s largest economy by 2030. Over time, this will likely add up to a structural investment trend of steadily growing exposure to China – and proactive investors may want to pre-empt that shift. China’s markets are open for business China has undertaken a concerted effort to open its markets to international investors. The launch of the Stock Connect programme in 2014 facilitated access to China A-shares listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges – representing a total market capitalisation of around USD 8.5 trillion, which is comparable to the eurozone. In 2018, the inclusion of A-shares in two key MSCI indices – meaning that money that follows those benchmarks must buy Chinese stocks – significantly boosted inflows. The increasing institutionalisation of Chinese markets has also enhanced their appeal. Listed companies on the A-shares indices are now required to file quarterly reports, and more than half of the largest A-shares companies have embraced global accounting standards and employed international auditors. Greater transparency and improved governance have also helped counter the volatility that has characterised A-shares in the past, although investors should stay cautious. China offers compelling growth stories China’s economy is changing. Once regarded as the world’s factory, it is now focusing more on higher-value goods and services. With its “Made in China 2025” initiative, it has ramped up domestic production in sectors like biotech, automotive and semiconductors, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. Meanwhile, other high-value sectors, including tourism, have benefited from wider changes in Chinese society. The emerging middle class that drove the economy’s pre-coronavirus growth should help fuel its tentative emergence from the outbreak, continuing China’s transformation from an export-driven economy towards one with a greater focus on domestic consumption. The A-shares market offers investors access to small- and mid-cap companies within those high-value sectors that are set to be the future drivers of China’s economic growth. China is on track to become the world’s largest economy China doubled its GDP in the 12 years to 2020, with an average annual growth rate of 7%. A slowdown seemed inevitable even before the pandemic, largely due to China’s rapid accumulation of debt since the global financial crisis and the government’s desire to limit future credit growth. The coronavirus exacerbated these challenges, and in April 2020 China reported the first drop in economic output in more than 40 years, with first-quarter GDP 6.8% lower year-on-year. Amid continuing tensions with the US, China also announced it would not set a GDP target for 2020 – for the first time in 30 years. Although the IMF is forecasting 1.2% GDP growth for China in 2020 – significantly lower than previous expectations – most major economies are expected to shrink due to the coronavirus, including a projected 5.9% GDP drop in the US. Any positive growth in China would vindicate President Xi Jinping’s long-term strategy and signify a resumption of the country’s growth trajectory. How to invest in China For investors considering China, A-shares have historically displayed very low correlation with global markets, suggesting that investing in A-shares could bring additional diversification benefits. While the ongoing institutionalisation of China’s A-share markets may result in higher correlations, this change will likely be a gradual process over many years. Because of domestic revenues and distinct economic and monetary policy, China A-shares have a low correlation with major equity markets As of January 31 2020. Correlation data is calculated based on historical return of respective MSCI indices for the past 10 years, using weekly USD return. See full names of all specific benchmarks at the end of this paper. Source: Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors. Some investors will access the China growth story through benchmark exposures, now that major indices – such as the MSCI World – include A-shares. In our view, such an approach underplays the opportunity, because China represents only a small percentage of these indices. For instance, A-shares constitute 4.1% of the MSCI EM index – a proxy for global emerging markets – and just 0.5% of the MSCI ACWI ex-US index, representing international equity performance. This is despite China currently accounting for around 15% of total global economic output. Instead, a deliberate, active allocation may be key to seizing the full scale of the opportunity in China while managing the risks. Investors will likely benefit from an informed, connected partner with local knowledge and the agility of an active management approach. At Allianz Global Investors, we isolate stock selection as our key driver of risk and return, whatever the prevailing market conditions. We achieve this by using our own extensive proprietary research, supported by regular engagement with listed companies’ management teams. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are now integrated into our China A strategy’s investment process, applying another dimension of risk management. While China may be a controversial topic for some investors, we expect the country to continue its upward path and the world’s investors are set to follow gradually. Now could be the time to get ahead of that trend.

       "  'content': 'Active is: Sharing insights China is positioned to lead Asia’s economic recovery from the coronavirus by Christiaan Tuntono | 10/06/2020 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The coronavirus pandemic applied a sudden brake to China’s growth story, as it did to most economies around the world. But there are signs that China could be ready to lead the way out of the downturn and resume its long-term growth trajectory. Key takeaways As the first country to face the coronavirus crisis, China looks set to be the first country in Asia to emerge from it, as business activity returns to the levels seen before the outbreak The Chinese government has shown itself willing to make the necessary policy interventions to keep the recovery on track and ensure the country resumes its long-term growth trajectory China and its nearest neighbours, such as Taiwan and South Korea, are best positioned for recovery, while south and south-eastern Asian economies face further challenges Continuing trade tensions with the US still threaten to hamper China’s recovery, but stronger regional trading relationships should limit the impact Following the slowdown triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, China’s economic recovery continues to progress as companies get back to work, quarantine measures are relaxed, and people venture outside. A resumption of “business as usual” among Chinese consumers will be essential to any recovery. Domestic demand will be needed to drive Chinese growth, particularly as demand for Chinese exports may remain subdued because of the crisis. While the daily cases of coronavirus infection in China have fallen to single digit levels, many other countries – notably those in south and south-east Asia – are still seeing hundreds and thousands of daily new infections, which is restricting economic demand. What drives economic recovery from coronavirus? In China and wider Asian economies, the pace of recovery from the outbreak will be determined by four key factors: the stage of the pandemic, institutional capacity to manage and contain the virus, central banks’ capacity and willingness to provide stimulus, and each economy’s openness towards external trade. Daily confirmed infection cases in Asia Source: Johns Hopkins University, MoH, MOPH, KCDC, Worldometers.info, AllianzGI Economics & Strategy, as of May 2020. As the chart shows, in May the Chinese economy was already at a more advanced stage of the outbreak than any of its peers. Meanwhile, the government has been decisive in acting to bring the virus under control and looks set to continue making policy interventions to support China’s economic recovery. At the annual National People’s Congress meeting in May the Chinese government announced a widened fiscal deficit target to support the economy. In a bid to shore up employment, the government pledged RMB 4 trillion of tax exemptions for factories and retailers, waived contributions to social welfare funds, and reduced bank interest rates and utilities costs. The government had already announced a new round of fiscal and monetary policy easing, introducing RMB 3.75 trillion of special local government debt and RMB 1 trillion of special treasury bonds. Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) further lowered the reserve ratio required of banks, to provide greater liquidity and lending to the country’s small and medium sized businesses. While supportive, these moves fell short of the expected levels of intervention, as China resists taking on too much debt as it did after 2008. However, the government has made it clear that it has further fiscal, financial and social security policies in reserve that it will roll out “without hesitation” if it considers further intervention necessary. Beyond the coronavirus pandemic, the main risk facing China (as well as wider Asian markets and global trade) could be the resurgence of trade tensions with the US. President Trump may put China at the centre of his re-election campaign. Any heightened rhetoric or increased tariffs could be negative for market sentiment. How will other Asian economies fare? Looking at other Asian economies, South Korea and Taiwan are also at an advanced stage of the pandemic, with a low risk of a second wave outbreak. As such, we expect them to follow close behind China as their economies gradually recover. We expect south and south-east Asian economies – in particular India, Indonesia and the Philippines – to endure further difficulties before recovering. This is mostly due to the ongoing spread of the pandemic in those nations, which are still seeing a rising number of new infection cases. We do not think the fiscal stimulus provided by these economies will be enough to offset the drag caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Stock markets have rebounded, but expect more volatility ahead Equity performance within each country is likely to be influenced by the expected severity of the pandemic, along with the future likelihood of idiosyncratic risks (such as a systemic credit default), and the risk of a negative geopolitical event with the potential to derail any recovery. Again, China scores well on these metrics, along with Taiwan and South Korea. However, equity prices within these markets have already recovered significantly since the lows of late March, so investors should exercise caution and expect volatility going forward. When it comes to fixed income investment, we see a low likelihood of restructuring among Asian public debt so would recommend investors to overweight sovereign and quasi-sovereign credit. These securities were sold off due to market concerns, causing spreads to widen above historical levels which offer good value. Again, we are more favourable on the North Asian economies – particularly China – and less so on south and south-east Asian economies. China set to be “first in, first out” of the coronavirus Like all economies around the world, China has been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. However, the Chinese government has taken decisive actions to contain the outbreak, stimulated business activity, and made the necessary policy interventions to support its economic recovery. Just as it was the first into the crisis, China appears well positioned to be the first out and continue its growth trajectory. Risks remain, but China’s continued establishment as a central hub of the world economy should see it lead the way on the long path to recovery. 1206147'},\n",

Key takeaways The opening up of the China A-share market could be a transformative event, giving investors a unique opportunity to optimise global equity portfolios Stock Connect programmes have lowered the cost of accessing domestic Chinese stocks and, as MCSI adds China A-shares into emerging-market indices, China’s growing importance will increasingly be reflected in global equity indices China A-shares add meaningful portfolio diversification, given their low historic correlation with major equity markets globally, and can help investors access a broader investment universe reflecting the faster-growing sectors of China’s “new economy” China’s importance is not reflected in the MSCI EM Index, which has a China A-share weighting of just 4.1%* and a mega/large-cap bias. “Buying the index” is not ideal for investors to gain appropriate exposure to China The asset class has risks relative to developed markets, but we expect such risks to normalise as the market matures On balance, we believe investors should consider a dedicated allocation to China A-shares. Our analysis suggests that a 10% to 30% direct allocation, coming from existing emerging-market portfolios, could improve returns and may diminish risk Introduction The opening up of the China A-share market to foreign investors – and the subsequent growing inclusion of a much larger number of Chinese companies in widely used equity indices – is poised to be, in our view, one of the most transformative events in the financial markets over the next decade. The implications for investors are numerous, complex and, above all, inevitable, making the maintenance of the status quo, in our view, an unviable solution. Investors considering an investment in the domestic China A-share market are now able to tap into the full China equity pool, with a significantly larger market capitalisation than Europe, for example. The A-share market alone encompasses more than 3,700 listed companies worth nearly USD 8.8 trillion across the entire market-capitalization spectrum (Exhibit 1). That’s comparable to the USD 9.3 trillion market capitalization of equities in the euro area.1 In this paper, we argue that an allocation to China A-shares presents a unique opportunity for investors to optimise their global equity portfolios. Our analysis shows that the Chinese domestic market exhibits low correlation with other widely held asset classes (such as Hong Kong-listed H-shares as well as US and European equities), a trait that stems from the fact that a) the Chinese domestic market is influenced by unique economic, political, and monetary policy considerations, and b) it has very different market participants than elsewhere. In addition, because these companies generate the vast majority of their revenues domestically, the effects of ongoing trade tensions with the US are less pronounced than may be commonly assumed.

Source: Nasdaq, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors Also, we explain why we believe that – given China’s long-term economic growth prospects as well as the still-abundant inefficiencies seen in the country’s domestic equity market – an investment in China A-shares exhibits superior alpha-generating potential. Lastly, we present our views on the future evolution of the market – as well as its growing representation in equity benchmarks – and weave our thoughts on how investors should consider tapping this market as well as what potential impact an allocation to China A-shares may have on existing portfolios. All in all, we see this as an evolving story, for both the China A-share market itself – which, we expect, should continue to grow and modernise – and Western investors – who, we believe, should take a progressive approach to allocating to this momentous asset class. A long path to access, but a potentially rewarding one nonetheless Before 2003, foreign investors could only trade some Chinese firms listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which is dominated by state-owned enterprises, such as banks and energy firms, or American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) traded in the United States. Together, H-shares and ADRs are known as “offshore China”. Access improved in 2003, with the launch of the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) programme, which offered foreign investors access via quotas to China A-shares – listed in the Shenzhen and Shanghai bourses (known as “onshore China”) and traded in renminbi. The RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) scheme, launched in late 2011, further expanded access by allowing Chinese financial firms to establish renminbi-denominated funds in Hong Kong for investment in the mainland. Subsequently, the launches of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect programme in 2014 and the Shenzhen Connect programme in 2016 gave foreigners access to Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed stocks, without quotas or the need for a licence. Importantly, these Stock Connect programmes also significantly lowered the costs of accessing the Chinese onshore market. Finally, on 1 June 2018, MSCI added China A-shares into its emerging market indices for the first time. Although it was a long road until foreign investors gained access to China’s domestic stock market, we believe that investors will come to realise that it might have been worth the wait given the size and scope of the opportunity. Now the second-largest economy globally, China is forecast to overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy by 2030. That growing economic importance will increasingly be reflected in global equity indices and in portfolios. Further, adding China A-shares to portfolios adds meaningful diversification, as evidenced by China A-shares’ low historic correlation with major equity markets globally (Exhibit 2). Two main reasons are behind this low correlation. Exhibit 2: Because of domestic revenues and distinct economic and monetary policy, China A-shares have a low correlation with major equity markets As of 31 January 2020. Correlation data is calculated based on historical return of respective MSCI indices for the past 10 years, using weekly USD return. See full names of all specific benchmarks at the end of this paper. Source: Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors First, the Chinese domestic equity market is, by many measures, still in its infancy. Trading is still dominated by retail investors (more on that later) and the regulatory environment – albeit evolving quickly – remains volatile and susceptible to the vicissitudes and trends of the Chinese domestic political environment. Second, the companies trading in this market sell primarily to local consumers. In fact, China A-share companies yield 90% of their revenue domestically, in many cases leaving them well placed to avoid significant negative impacts associated with ongoing trade tensions with the US. This local revenue base makes them less sensitive to global macroeconomic trends, and more sensitive to the directions set by both the Chinese government as well as the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank. Traditionally, Chinese fiscal and monetary policies have “marched to their own beat”, and have not been highly correlated to the policies adopted by the US and other Western monetary authorities. China A-shares and the promise of the “new economy” In addition to the low-correlation factor, the China A-share market provides an entry door for investors to more deeply benefit from China’s ongoing shift from an export-driven economy into the so-called “new economy”, characterised by an increased role of domestic consumption and higher-value-added sectors, such as tourism, entertainment, healthcare equipment, industrial automation, new energy vehicles, biotech, software and new materials. As shown in Exhibit 3, investing in China A-shares gives investors greater access to the small- and mid-cap companies set to be the future drivers of China’s economic growth – technology, innovation and the rapidly expanding Chinese middle class. Exhibit 3: China A-shares better reflect faster-growing sectors of the “new economy” MSCI China All Shares Index, index breakdown by listing location As of 31 January 2020 Data analysis based on the MSCI All China Index (broken down by sector and stock exchange). Source: Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors In fact, more than half of China’s economic output comes from the services sector, and the country is a major investor in, and adopter of, digital technologies. So, China A-shares – especially when accessed through non-passive instruments – better reflect the promise of the country’s digital future than emerging-market benchmarks such as the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which is highly biased towards Chinese mega- and large-cap stocks. Buying the MSCI EM Index alone is not the ideal way to boost China exposure Today, most investors benchmark their exposure to China to international equity (ie., MSCI ACWI ex-US) and/or global emerging market (ie., MCSI EM) indices. But simply increasing allocations to those indices may not be an ideal way to broaden China exposure. Here’s why: although China A-shares are now included in MSCI indices, their weighting within the MSCI EM Index and MSCI ACWI Index are, as of this writing, just 4.1% and 0.5%, respectively. To put that into context, the market cap of China A-shares as a percentage of global equities was 9% (at the end of 2019) and the overall Chinese economy accounted for 15.8% of global economic output in 2018.2 As the numbers show, China A-shares are considerably under-represented in one of the benchmarks most widely used by investors. The current Chinese exposure within the MSCI EM Index is weighted heavily toward low-growth companies and concentrated in a few mega-cap technology firms, such as Alibaba and Tencent.3 This extra “mega/large-cap bias” creates further imbalances for investors seeking to establish an exposure to Chinese equities that is concomitant to the current growth opportunity for that market. In this context, we argue that a direct allocation to China A-shares – especially when done through non-passive instruments – can provide investors a more well-adjusted exposure to the Chinese market. For example, investing in A-shares gives investors greater access to a plethora of opportunities among small- and mid-cap companies. As illustrated in Exhibit 4, 38.1% of the MSCI China A-Shares Onshore Index is represented by small- and mid-cap companies with a market cap below USD 10 billion, compared to 14.2% in offshore China. Exhibit 4: China A-shares complement China stocks in the MSCI EM Index and offer a plethora of opportunities among small- and mid-cap companies As of 31 January 2020 Source: Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors Further, while it’s certainly a positive step that MSCI has begun adding China A-shares to its key MSCI EM Index, representation will likely remain very small and, in our view, artificially depressed. From this perspective, we don’t believe that investors who decide to define their China A-share exposure by simply “buying the MSCI EM Index” will be properly positioned to seize this opportunity in the next few years. That said, we do expect that the A-share weightings of the MSCI EM Index will increase significantly over time to reflect the size of China A-share markets, altering the composition of future EM benchmarks. Exhibit 5 extrapolates what China weights would look like in the MSCI EM index if those weights were calculated by a) the current selected number of China A-shares included in the index, and b) all shares currently trading in the China A-shares market. Exhibit 5: China A-shares are substantially under-represented in the MSCI Emerging Market Index As of February 2020 Middle chart is based on MSCI’s proposal in November 2019 to include 472 large- and mid-cap China A-share stocks into the MSCI Emerging Market Index. Right chart is based on the assumption that all China stocks are available to be included into the MSCI Emerging Market Index. We use an 85% discount factor, which should approximately represent the large- and mid-cap universe within China A-shares. Source: MSCI, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Allianz Global Investors As Exhibit 5 shows, China would account for 43% of the index in the first scenario and 50% of the index in the second one. Although we don’t expect those levels of exposure will be reached any time in the foreseeable future, the analysis does reiterate an important issue: investors seeking to be “ahead of the curve” to fully capture the current opportunity in the Chinese equity market are unlikely to achieve that goal by simply sticking to current benchmark weights. Understanding China A-share risks and how to mitigate them While the China A-share market represents a significant opportunity, it carries risks. We expect that the increased access to China A-shares and the rising importance of the country’s economy will attract greater participation from investors. Nevertheless, the market for now remains dominated by retail investors. Indeed, domestic retail investors, primarily focused on chasing short-term trading profits, account for more than 80% of daily turnover. Also, local Chinese equity analysts tend to be less experienced than is the case in developed markets, leading to a greater frequency of earnings surprises than in more mature markets. As shown in Exhibit 6, all this contributes to higher volatility – something underlined in June 2018, when onshore China suffered declines of nearly 11%. There is also higher sector rotation for China A-shares compared to developed-market indices, and a high dispersion of returns (Exhibit 7). Exacerbating risks, while the regulatory environment is evolving at a fast pace, it remains fairly unpredictable. Exhibit 6: China A-share stock suspensions have declined % of China A-share stocks suspended As of 20 February 2020 Source: Goldman Sachs, Allianz Global Investors Those risks, however, are characteristic of many developing markets, and they tend to dissipate as the market matures. It’s worth noting, for example, that the trading experience of the past 20 years in Taiwan shows that as the influence of foreign investors and domestic institutions increases and the dominance of retail investors diminishes, so too does volatility. As highlighted in Exhibit 6, stock-trading suspensions, relatively common just a few years ago, have become less of a concern as the regulatory framework has strengthened. Exhibit 7: China A-share turnover has spiked and far exceeds comparable developed-market indices, leading to a high dispersion of returns On balance, we believe that the time has come for investors to consider a dedicated allocation to China A-shares, especially since, as noted previously, the asset class can offer a significant source of diversification for global stock investors. The opportunity set is substantial, especially for investors seeking to optimise their equity exposures. To underscore how relatively absent foreign investors are from what could be the most significant market opportunity today, they still only own around 3.8% of China A-shares4, at a time when MSCI EM is adding China A-shares exposure. All in all, it is our view that, despite current risks, the China A-share market has matured enough to accommodate the arrival of foreign investors. But investors should approach the market with caution to avoid potential pitfalls and mitigate inherent risks. We believe that active management can help investors to properly – and wisely – exploit the China A-shares market’s inefficiencies to generate potential outsized returns in general, and alpha in particular. Just as important, however, active management can – as our experience in investing in China A-shares has taught us – generate potential outperformance not only by selecting the highest-performing stocks but also by avoiding problematic ones. This is especially true when investing in a still-developing marketplace, with volatility levels that are higher than in developed markets. In the Chinese domestic market, potential downside protection is as critical as potential upside reward. Deploying China A-shares in an institutional portfolio In light of the current opportunity and the early stage of development of the China A-shares market, investors should, in our view, take an incremental approach to deploying this new asset class in their portfolios. We consider the case for investing in onshore China today as similar to investing in emerging markets a quarter of a century ago: back then, many investors viewed deploying capital to developing economies (and immature capital markets) as risky. Today, however, an emerging-market allocation is a typical part of any serious investor’s strategic asset allocation. We forecast that allocations to onshore China will follow a similar trajectory. As mentioned previously, it is our view that the importance of China – and China A-shares in particular – is underrepresented in the benchmark index typically used for emerging-market allocations, falling far short of both the importance of China’s economy and its equity market. Consequently, we believe that adding a more significant allocation to China A-shares as part of a portfolio’s current emerging-market allocation makes sense for both risk-return reasons and for portfolio optimisation, especially given the asset class’ low correlation to other global equities. The question then becomes, how heavily should an emerging-market allocation tilt toward onshore China? While the precise answer varies among investors, data suggests that the sweet spot may be between a 10% to 30% direct allocation to China A-shares, with the money to fund that allocation coming from investors’ existing emerging-market portfolios. Using the MSCI EM index as our proxy for a “core” emerging-market portfolio, we compiled historical data from the past 15 years (Exhibits 8 and 9) to observe what the impact of adding the MSCI China A-Shares Onshore Index to an MSCI EM index allocation would be on annualised returns and on risk. Exhibit 8: Overweighting emerging market allocations to China A-shares may increase the risk-adjusted returns of portfolios Allocation from global emerging markets to China A-shares Table shows analysis of returns for the MSCI Emerging Market Index (used as proxy for global emerging markets) and MSCI China A Onshore Index (used as proxy for the China A-share market) indices from 31 January 2005/2020. Percentages shown in the table represent portion of portfolio allocated to China A-shares. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Source: Allianz Global Investors Our analysis reveals that shifting 10% of one’s global emerging-market allocation to China A-shares would improve the overall portfolio return from an annualised 7.5% to 8.3%. And, mainly due to the asset class’ low correlation characteristics, the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio would see a significant enhancement from 0.29 to 0.34. Exhibit 9: Adding China A-shares to MSCI EM allocations can enhance the risk/return profile of an emerging-market allocation Chart shows analysis of returns for the MSCI Emerging Market Index (used as proxy for global emerging markets) and MSCI China A Onshore Index (used as proxy for the China A-share market) indices from 31 January 2005/2020. Percentages shown on the chart represent portion of portfolio allocated to China A-shares. Source: Allianz Global Investors A bolder shift of 30% of one’s allocation to China A-shares would compound the enhancements further, with the annualised return of the overall portfolio rising to 9.7% and the Sharpe ratio jumping to 0.4. Our 15-year historical risk/return analysis suggests that a portfolio’s Sharpe ratio would be maximised with an allocation of 50%. While any such historical analysis is very dependent on its start and end points, these results suggest that a meaningful allocation to China A-shares would be beneficial from a portfolio construction perspective. The historical analysis highlights many of the benefits that investors can reap from allocating to the Chinese onshore equity markets and, we believe, can be used as a starting point when considering exposure to the asset class. Further, we recognise that historical analyses are very start- and end-point sensitive. Those caveats notwithstanding, history and experience have shown us that the Chinese domestic equity market is clearly on an evolutionary path, especially in terms of its outlook for broader investor participation and potential lower volatility. With that in mind, we firmly believe that it behooves investors to consider an increased allocation to China equity through exposure to the country’s domestic market. But – due to the evidence presented in this paper – investors should deploy capital in a steady yet evolutionary fashion, to benefit from a “first-mover” advantage without overly taxing their risk budgets. Conclusion Investors can finally access the domestic Chinese economy with relative ease through Stock Connect programmes to invest in China A-shares, giving them the ability to harness the promise of an increasingly consumer-driven “new economy” – one that is set to grow into the world’s largest economy within a dozen years. Put bluntly, the opportunity could be the single most transformative event in financial markets in the coming decade. However, simply “buying the MSCI EM Index” – currently still sorely underweight onshore China – would leave investors at risk of missing out on most of the potential opportunity. As a result, we believe that the time is right for investors to consider increasing allocations to onshore China, as they did with emerging-market allocations a generation ago. That can be achieved by investors altering their existing emerging-market allocations to add direct allocation to China A-shares in order to better position portfolios for the intermediate and long term. Historical data suggests that doing so could improve returns and may also diminish risk, making it a compelling portfolio optimiser.

Although the country is not yet out of danger, we expect China’s economy to recover in the second half of this year – which could be another positive signal for China’s domestically driven A-share market. Key takeaways After China’s economy ground to a virtual halt earlier this year, most companies have resumed work – which should ease pressure in the global supply chain and help Chinese manufacturers Even with the coronavirus outbreak, “onshore” China A-shares have outperformed “offshore” China H-shares this year, and significantly outperformed equities in the US, Europe, Japan and emerging markets Given that China A-share companies get almost all their revenues domestically, they are likely to have an advantage over exporters amid a slowing global economy With coronavirus causing widespread volatility, it’s worth noting that A-shares have had a very low correlation with other major asset classes – including them in a global portfolio helps diversify away some portfolio risk and helps generate a much better risk-return profile Amid so much uncertainty, don’t overlook China A-shares As the coronavirus pandemic grows increasingly serious in many parts of the globe, the true human cost is only slowly becoming clear. The ultimate economic effect will be difficult to assess as well, though we have already seen a dramatic slowdown in the global economy and an end to a multi-year bull market. Yet although China was hit hard by this viral outbreak only a few months ago, we expect China’s economy to recover in the second half of this year. As a result, while most investors are understandably cautious about taking risk amid so much uncertainty, we believe now is a good time to take a closer look at China A-shares – Chinese companies that are listed in domestic markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and made available to local and foreign investors. After a coronavirus slowdown, corporate China appears set to rebound China’s economy was already set to slow in 2020, but strict quarantine measures early in the year brought economic activity to a temporary halt even as they saved countless lives. Assuming the country doesn’t get hit with a massive second wave of infection, we think domestic economic activity could continue to strengthen in the coming months. This should help expectations for corporate earnings growth, which moved lower earlier this year. Since then, most of China’s large companies and around two thirds of its small- to medium-size companies have resumed work, according to China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. We expect this will help ease stress in the global supply chain and help Chinese manufacturers, even though the sharp contraction in overseas demand is still expected to slow orders for Chinese exports. China’s success at executing its post-coronavirus recovery plan is one of the main reasons why China A-shares have been resilient compared to risk assets globally. As the accompanying chart shows, China A-shares have fallen this year, but significantly less so than other asset classes. China A-shares have been outperforming other major equity markets Gross return (USD) as at 24 March 2020 Source: Refinitiv Datastream, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 24 March 2020. Returns are calculated on USD total return basis. Indices used are: MSCI China A Onshore Index, Hang Seng Chinese Enterprises Index, S&P 500 Composite Index, MSCI Europe Index, TOPIX Index, MSCI Emerging Market Index. Past performance, or any prediction, projection or forecast, is not indicative of future performance. The future of A-shares depends on global consumers and domestic investors In our view there are two key – and opposing – influences that will determine the near-term direction of China A-shares: Globally, consumers could spend less on Chinese goods. The key risk is the global demand shock if consumers spend less due to the fall-off in economic activity. Although 90% of A-share company revenues are domestic, according to investment group CLSA, China will still feel secondary consequences of the global economy’s sudden downturn. This will limit the rate of China’s economic recovery. Chinese investors could keep buying domestic stocks. On the other hand, liquidity conditions in China remain favourable for equities, in contrast to the rest of the world. The main participants in China A-share markets are onshore private investors. Their investment options are generally limited to domestic equities, the domestic bond market, where yields are falling, or the property market, where prices are already high. So far, this scenario has been winning, which has helped A-share performance. We are also optimistic about China’s outlook because of its monetary policy. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has a wider positive interest-rate gap than its counterparts in Europe, Japan and the United States. The PBoC also has a wider buffer between where its policy rate currently stands and the zero lower bound – or even negative territory. These factors bode well for attracting capital inflows and providing stronger support to economic growth. The long-term case for A-shares remains unchanged The structural trends supporting A-shares are still in place. For example, the onshore A-share market is large and diversified, with bigger exposure to so-called new economy industries like consumer services, electric vehicles and industrial automation. In addition, global indices continue to raise their A-share weightings even though it is not just foreign investors who are buying A-shares: domestic investors, employees and company management teams have all increased their ownership in the past two years. Perhaps most importantly, the correlations between China A-shares and other major asset classes is still very low. According to Bloomberg data from 31 January 2020, the correlation of A-shares and world equities was around 0.2 over the past 10 years, while the correlation with US and European equities was even lower. Including China A-shares in a global portfolio helps diversify away some portfolio risk and could help generate a much better risk-return profile. In addition, the relatively underdeveloped nature of China’s capital markets may well be playing to its advantage in the current environment. The forced liquidations seen elsewhere, for example from risk-parity strategies or leveraged quant-driven hedge funds, are not a big influence in China’s primarily retail-driven domestic markets. Considerations for investors China’s success at fighting the new coronavirus could impart a valuable lesson for investors in other regions. China has shown that the more important indicator of a country’s health – both physical and economic – is its ability to contain and combat the virus within its borders, rather than how much monetary and/or fiscal stimulus it plans to enact. We expect domestically focused Chinese companies to feel less of an impact from a global slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. China’s recovery is likely to be supported by companies that focus on domestic demand, and by public infrastructure investment projects. But use caution when considering Chinese companies that rely more on external trade, such as auto component makers. There is a considerable amount of debt in China, and smaller businesses experiencing business disruption may have difficulty accessing funding at this stage. But this is also positive news for the stronger players. Look for small- to mid-cap companies that are market leaders in niche market segments, like semiconductors or frozen foods. These are fragmented industries, and gaining market share here while competitors are challenged could lay the groundwork for multiple years of high growth. 1127875'}]"

The Year of the Tiger could offer multiple opportunities for investors, notably around sectors related to China’s future technologies and climate programmes. Key takeaways Volatility is a part of China’s investment story – as 2021 demonstrated – but the country’s development trajectory remains promising as we enter the Year of the Tiger Continued focus on innovation will continue to drive China’s transition from its previous status as “the factory of the world” China’s determination to be seen as a global leader on climate will inform policy – and create opportunities for investors Increased government intervention should not scare investors away, and could even drive thematic investment opportunities This lunar new year, China is celebrating the Year of the Tiger – but this festive period arrives off the back of several notable episodes of economic turbulence and market volatility. The MSCI China index fell 21% during 2021 due to slowing consumption, high-profile issues within the property market and increased regulatory interventions. At the same time, China has also committed to doubling its GDP by 2035 – a target that will require annual growth of 4.7%. The Covid-19 pandemic in China severely hampered economic growth initially – as it did worldwide – but China’s relative success in managing the coronavirus has helped its economy recover quickly. If China is to meet its long-term economic goals, it will need a clear way forward. Fortunately for investors, China has been upfront about how it plans to achieve such an ambitious target with a strategy centred around tech-related industries and sustainability – two keys to investing during the Year of the Tiger. The outlook for regulatory intervention Government crackdowns in areas including China’s property sector and offshore listings fuelled the volatility economic weakness. Should investors fear further regulatory interventions as the year unfolds? Onshore China equities may benefit from further US-China “decoupling” At one stage during the sell-down in autumn 2021, the MSCI China Index was underperforming the S&P 500 by more than 40% over a six-month period, the worst relative performance in at least a decade. There have been signs of a stabilisation in the early days of 2022 but China equities have still meaningfully trailed the US. But China equities do not all march in lockstep. There has been a marked divergence between China A-shares (which trade on the two main domestic Chinese exchanges) and offshore-dominated indices. In 2021, the MSCI China A Onshore Index returned 4.0%, compared to the offshore-dominated MSCI China Index’s return of -21.7%. In other words, during 2021, China A-shares outperformed by more than 25 percentage points. These market shifts are happening against the backdrop of a broader US-China market “decoupling”. The Chinese government has clamped down on domestic companies listing on US exchanges. The restrictions announced were accompanied by a stricter cross-border security and already seem to have driven many overseas listings closer to home. During the second half of 2021 to early December, only one mainland China-based company priced a US IPO, against the 29 that listed in Hong Kong. As this process of separating the two countries’ markets continues, investors who want to understand the nuances between markets and identify opportunities will need on-the-ground insights. Property concerns seem to have been managed A rapidly cooling property sector was a central factor in stockmarket turbulence in 2021, with high-profile stocks in the sector – most notably China Evergrande – suffering dramatic falls. This came amid broader weakness in the property market. In November last year, 61 of 70 cities covered by the national home price survey saw declines in primary house prices. This sustained weakness prompted regulators to intervene in an attempt to ease the worst of the funding and liquidity crunch. The regulatory intervention served to amplify volatility last year, but it may help usher in a managed decline in property prices during the coming year rather than a crash. Foreign interest in China appears relatively undimmed While China undoubtedly faces several headwinds, these challenges do not seem to have diminished its appeal to foreign organisations. Research from HSBC in late 2021 suggested that, of more than 2,000 foreign-based companies operating in China, 97% plan to maintain their presence and 60% plan to expand their supply chains in China – or are already expanding. Signs also suggest that Chinese policy changes have done little to stem venture capital investment. The shifting regulatory environment clearly demands attention from private equity investors trying to fund the next generation of leading Chinese companies, but the deal numbers suggest no slowdown in funding. According to research firm Prequin, venture capital investments in China during 2021 reached USD 130.6bn, a new record total and a 50% increase on 2020’s USD 86.7bn. Expect China’s continued emergence on the world stage The world’s eyes will be on China at the start of the new year with the Winter Olympics taking place in Beijing during February, and the country will be keen to present a positive image. Events in China during recent months demonstrate the need for investors to understand the broader political and social context within the country. A certain amount of volatility is part and parcel of investing in China, but a comprehensive grasp of the underlying environment can help investors navigate it. China is entering “Phase 3”: here’s why it matters We’ve written before about “Phase 3” of China’s emergence on the global stage, which could provide a platform for further opportunities for investors. (Phase 1 was when China joined the WTO and became as a major link in global supply chains, Phase 2 saw China overtake Japan as the second-largest economy and begin integration of its markets into the global financial system). Phase 3 is arguably the toughest as China attempts to use its economic might to establish and cement its place at the top table while exercising its “soft” powers of diplomacy to build influence. Sustainability is central to China’s ambitions A key part of China’s transition lies in its determination to be seen to be taking a lead on climate change. The country has set out clear decarbonisation goals, and it used last year’s COP26 UN climate change conference as a platform to announce its willingness to co-operate with the US to achieve them. Before COP26, China had already committed to reach a peak in carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2060. China is already the largest market for electric vehicles globally and, as Exhibit 1 shows, its reliance on EVs is expected to grow further. Similarly, government targets relating to energy provision (Exhibit 2) show a swing towards renewable sources before the 2060 deadline. Exhibit 1: China passenger vehicle sales breakdown by fuel type – government target penetration rates Source: JP Morgan estimate. Exhibit 2: China power generation breakdown (thousand terrawatt hours) Source: Goldman Sachs. Data as at January 2021. There is still a long way to go, but if China continues its current trajectory, climate and sustainability could provide the ideal opportunity to write a positive new chapter in its history. Expect continued focus on social issues Beijing has been emphasising its goal of “common prosperity”, which it plans to achieve by tackling wealth inequality and ensuring the entire population feels a part of China’s growth story. We believe this is driven as much by a political agenda as an economic one, and it has caused some issues for investors. In an attempt to ensure fairer access to education, the government imposed a major clampdown on the private education sector, and there is ongoing pressure on generic drug prices to ensure they are affordable. Investors’ instinct may be to be wary of any further policies in the name of common prosperity, but the initiative could still create further investment opportunities, possibly linked to trends like healthier living and increased consumption. Wealth inequality has been an issue in China for decades and, while it has not got significantly worse in recent years, it has attracted more public concern. The ruling Communist Party will want to be seen to be effectively tackling inequality in order to ensure legitimacy and popular support, especially as it approaches the 20th Party Congress in October, where President Xi Jinping will likely seek to be elected for a historic third term. What it all means for investors Here are four ideas for investors for the Year of the Tiger Seek out strategic sectors. Opportunities aligned with the topics above include sectors linked to China’s strategic need for self-sufficiency (semiconductors and robotics), and stocks linked to China’s carbon-emissions targets (renewable energy and the electric vehicle supply chain). Despite potential headwinds from the supply side (possible shortages of electricity and chips), we expect these sectors to continue to underpin China’s growth. Think “core” and “satellite” investments. One way to do this is by putting China A-shares at the core of a portfolio’s China allocation, and then adding thematic satellites focused on big-potential areas such as healthcare or future technologies. Themes relating to social trends like increased family sizes (incorporating branded baby clothes and food) and healthier lifestyles will also likely emerge. Accept the reality of volatility. Investors would be well-served by accepting that volatility has historically accompanied China’s stockmarket growth (see Exhibit 3). An active approach may help investors navigate the shifting environment and to use the inevitable volatility to build positions. Learn how policy shapes the future. It is essential to understand China’s economic, social and cultural history – and how its policy agenda is evolving. This can help investors discover where the country’s strategic priorities translate into opportunities. Those sectors that are central to the country’s planned transformation should continue to enjoy political support and are consequently also less likely to be affected by regulatory change.
