At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug? Douglas Peterson Thank you, Mark. We're pleased to discuss our third quarter results and how we're growing, innovating and executing with discipline even in the face of a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. With each quarter that passes, we see further evidence of the strength of our combined company. While no one could have predicted what this year would have looked like, we have benefited from the diversification of our revenue and profit streams and that ballast has provided great resilience as we continue to navigate choppy waters. . It's been nearly two years since we announced the merger, and I'm proud of the progress we've made. We continue to put the customer at the core of everything we do and we continue to demonstrate a clear commitment to our people while maintaining a high standard of operational excellence. We have an incredibly bright future, and I'm excited to share more with you about our strategic vision at our Investor Day on December 1. As we look at our third quarter financial highlights, I want to remind you that the adjusted financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics in the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period. Revenue decreased 8% year-over-year or 6% ex FX, with growth in four of our six divisions being offset by continued decreases in Ratings, as well as a year-over-year decline in Engineering Solutions this quarter due to the timing impact of a single product that Ewout will discuss later. Recurring revenue increased 2% year-over-year, representing 84% of revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses declined 5% year-over-year as cost synergies and disciplined expense management offset some of the inflationary impact we're seeing in labor and technology. Outside of the Ratings business, we saw an average of approximately 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. We're updating our guidance ranges to reflect continued headwinds in Ratings as well as better-than-expected performance in Indices. Guidance ranges for our other four divisions are unchanged from last quarter. I'd also like to share a few other highlights from the third quarter. As I mentioned, we're coming up on two years since the merger was announced and nearly eight months since the close. Our post-merger integration efforts are proceeding on track, but very importantly, we're outperforming on both cost and revenue synergies. Our customer conversations remain encouraging despite the economic environment. We continue to see significant growth in multiple business lines due to secular trends that will likely benefit us for years to come, like energy transition as well as the near-term benefit we see from volatility and the need for insights and analytics in times of turbulence. We also remain committed to the capital allocation plan we laid out for you at the time the merger closed. We're on track to deploy the full $12 billion in funds for accelerated share repurchases by year-end.  Turning to the commercial success we're seeing in the business. The merger continues to generate encouraging conversations with our customers about the increased value we offer as a combined company. In Market Intelligence, we developed a strong commercial pipeline in September, and we believe we will see a reacceleration of the Desktop business in the fourth quarter. Between Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights, we've generated well over 3,000 cross-sell referrals since the merger closed, and the conversion rates are strong. Despite the issuance environment, our Ratings teams remain highly engaged. We remain connected with investors and issuers to maintain relationships and ensure we have the appropriate understanding of their needs in advance of any recovery in the debt markets. Commodity Insights and Mobility are both seeing significantly improved retention rates relative to recent history as well as strong competitive wins and new customer growth. We saw a very important win in our Indices business this quarter as a large Japanese asset manager launched the first cross-asset ETF in Japan based on both iBoxx Fixed Income and S&amp;P Dow Jones Equity Indices. While it's still early in our efforts in cross-asset indices, this launch is powerful proof of the demand for such products among global asset managers. Now to recap the financial results for the third quarter. Revenue decreased 8% to $2.86 billion or 6% constant currency. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 12% to $1.3 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 46% as both profits and margin were negatively impacted by the decrease in Ratings transaction revenue, partially offset by cost synergies realized in the quarter. Our non-Ratings businesses in aggregate grew revenue 4% in the quarter compared to prior year. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which was 45.5% as of the third quarter. Despite the impact of the issuance environment, we benefited from the resiliency of our businesses as well as disciplined cost management and cost synergies to significantly moderate the impact to our adjusted EPS, which declined only 4% year-over-year. Looking across the six divisions, I'm pleased to report positive growth across four of our divisions, with Ratings continuing to work through a difficult issuance cycle and Engineering Solutions entering an off-cycle quarter without the sale of a core product that is released once every two years. Throughout the year, we've seen outsized growth in certain products as customers depend on our data and information to make informed decisions during uncertain times. We saw double-digit revenue growth in multiple product lines as a result. Within our Indices business, revenue from exchange-traded derivatives outperformed our internal expectations, growing nearly 40% year-over-year. Our CDS Indices, which include the CDX and iTraxx index families, increased 66%. Markets continue to recognize our leadership in areas like climate and financial data, and we provide a consolidated platform on which to access information, whether it's tracking market movements, company performance or identifying physical risk from weather events, our customers continue to come to us for help navigating the uncertainty. This is evident in the growth we saw in key product offerings for Market Intelligence, including Trucost and Equities, Data and Analytics. I'm pleased to mark the first anniversary of the launch of Platts Dimensions Pro, a one-stop experience across Platts benchmark price assessments; news and analytics spanning 13 commodities, including energy transition. Over the last year, we've continuously increased functionality, introducing new features on a regular basis. This unified platform is gaining clear recognition with active user growth nearly doubling in just the last six months. Moreover, some of our newer benchmarks continue to expand their market presence, our low-sulfur marine fuel assessment is a great indicator of the trajectory of a successful new benchmark. Assessments like this often take multiple years to truly scale and become literal market benchmarks. In the third quarter, approximately 1.3 billion barrels of fuel were traded based on price assessment, representing a 15% increase compared to last year. Our iron ore assessment has been the primary physical market pricing reference for seaborne fine iron ore delivered to China for over 10 years, and it's still growing at an impressive rate. We understand the importance of reliable market benchmarks to the secular energy transition story, and we're positioning ourselves for long-term success. The chart on the right shows the cumulative number of new assessments we have launched and energy transition over the last two years. These include a new suite of Australian hydrogen prices covering one of the key producers of this future fuel as well as the Methane Performance Certificate that we believe will be an integral component of low-carbon crude trading. Now turning to issuance. During the third quarter, global-rated issuance decreased 40% year-over-year; in the U.S., rated issuance in aggregate decreased 47%; European-rated issuance decreased 19%; and in Asia, rated issuance declined 47%. High yield was down by 80% year-over-year in both United States and Europe and was down nearly 100% in Asia. Structured finance in Europe was the only positive regional category in the quarter, increasing 7% year-over-year. We've included additional details on the subcomponents of issuance by region in the slide deck.  We continue to make significant progress in our sustainability products. ESG revenue increased nearly 40% year-over-year to nearly $50 million in the quarter. We saw continued innovation in our ESG indices and the market recognition of our strength. We launched the S&amp;P Net Zero 2050 Carbon Budget Indices, and we ended the quarter with ESG ETF AUM of $35 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year in a down market. Within Market Intelligence, we launched enhanced Physical Risk Exposure Scores and Financial Impact data sets to support clients as they seek to understand and manage the physical and financial exposure to climate change. Our Ratings division continues to see success here as well, completing 13 ESG evaluations and 23 Sustainable Financing Opinions in the quarter. One of the most important competitive advantages in our ESG efforts is the Corporate Sustainability Assessment, which is an annual comprehensive assessment completed in partnership with participating companies. The S&amp;P Global brand and everything it stands for continues to drive growth in the number of companies seeking to partner with us in this assessment process. Year-to-date, we've seen more than 2,300 companies opt in, a more than 25% increase from the same time last year. Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. Beginning with our issuance forecast. Our Ratings research team is expecting an approximately 19% decline in global market issuance, including both rated and unrated issuance for the full year. This compares to the previous forecast of down 16%. Importantly, our financial results and guidance are more closely tied to billed issuance, which can differ materially from market issuance as we described last quarter. Year-to-date, market issuances declined approximately 14%, while billed issuances declined approximately 42%. Based on the trends we saw in September and October, we now expect billed issuance to be down approximately 45% to 50% for the full year. When we look to the broader macroeconomic environment for the rest of 2022, we continue to see further deterioration from what we expected in August. In addition to the downward trend in issuance, our expectations for GDP growth, inflation and the commodities markets have all lowered. With only two months left in 2022, we wanted to provide what will likely be the final update on some of the macroeconomic indicators we're using to help inform our financial guidance for the year. We'll not be discussing our expectations for 2023 on this call, but we will be closely monitoring both the internal and external indicators of our business over the coming months. And we'll plan to provide our initial 2023 outlook at the customary time when we report our fourth quarter results early next year. Before I turn the call over to Ewout, I want to thank the incredible people we have at S&amp;P Global. Our people have executed well in a challenging environment this year and have delivered great value for our customers and the organization while managing a complex integration. I'm confident that we're well positioned to drive long-term growth and create long-term value for our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ewout to walk through financials and guidance. Ewout? Ewout Steenbergen Thank you, Doug. Doug has already discussed the headline financial results, and I would like to cover a few other items. As Doug mentioned, the adjusted financial metrics we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from divested businesses in all periods. Adjusted corporate unallocated expenses improved from a year ago, driven by a combination of synergies and reduced incentive costs. Our net interest expense decreased 17% as we benefit from lower average rates due to refinancings following the merger. Adjusted effective tax rate was up modestly, but towards the low end of the guidance range we expect for the full year. As most are aware, we exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the third quarter were approximately $108 million in merger-related expenses. The details of which can be found in the appendix. We generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, of $965 million. We remain committed to returning the majority of this cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have deployed $11 billion towards share repurchases, and we expect the final $1 billion of our previously announced ASR program to be completed by year-end. We note that the U.S. dollar remained strong against many foreign currencies, and we've seen a corresponding impact on both our revenue and expenses. As a reminder, approximately 3/4 of our international revenue is invoiced in U.S. dollars, which provides some protection to revenue against FX volatility. In addition to the natural hedges that exist due to the global footprint of our people, we have a hedging program in place that further mitigates the ultimate impact on our earnings. For the third quarter, we saw a $0.03 favorable impact to EPS from foreign exchange and hedging programs. Turning to expenses. We are committed to disciplined expense management in this current environment. And similar to last quarter, we highlight the levers we continue to pull to protect margins where we can while still preserving our investments to drive future growth. Actions taken include pull forward in synergies, a reduction in incentive accruals, adjustments to the timing of certain investments and pausing select hiring and limiting consulting spend in some areas. Through cost synergies and other management actions we have taken so far this year, we expect to generate more than $400 million in expense savings for 2022.  Now I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the third quarter, we achieved $165 million in cumulative cost synergies and our current annualized run rate is $311 million. I'm pleased to report we continue to outperform our initial time line on both revenue and cost synergies year-to-date. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the third quarter is $641 million. Given the outperformance on the timing of our synergies, we now expect to achieve slightly more than the 35% to 40% of total cost synergies in 2022 that we were targeting previously. Now let's turn to the division results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence revenue increased 4% with strong growth in Data and Analytics, offset by slower growth in Desktop and flat growth in Enterprise Solutions. For this quarter, recurring revenue accounted for approximately 96% of Market Intelligence total revenue. Expenses were roughly flat this quarter with increases in compensation expense, cloud spend and outside services being offset by cost synergies and lower incentive compensation. Market Intelligence remains the biggest driver of cost synergies from the merger and the synergy outperformance we have seen year-to-date. Segment operating profit increased 13%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 260 basis points to 33.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 30.9%. The OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division contributed $19 million in adjusted operating profit to the company. As a reminder, because the JV is a 50% owned joint venture operating independent of the company, we recognize their results on an after-tax basis and do not include the financial results of OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was growth in most categories. And on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 3%, Data &amp; Advisory Solutions revenue grew 7%, Enterprise Solutions revenue was flat and Credit &amp; Risk Solutions revenue grew 7%. For Desktop, we saw slower growth this quarter, driven in part by the timing of certain revenue recognition items, and we expect desktop to reaccelerate in the fourth quarter. For Enterprise Solutions, the business line continues to see headwinds in several of our volume-driven products that rely on equity and debt capital markets activity under variable subscription terms. Excluding the impact of FX and these volume-driven products, growth across Market Intelligence would have been approximately 7% year-over-year. While we remain confident in the long-term growth of all these product lines, we expect deceleration in categories outside of Desktop to persist in the fourth quarter. Now turning to Ratings. Ratings continued to face difficult market conditions this quarter as issuance volumes remained muted with revenue decreasing 33% year-over-year. Transaction revenue decreased to 56% on the continued softness in issuance we highlighted earlier. Non-transaction revenue decreased 6% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower Rating Evaluation Services and initial Issuer Credit Ratings, partially offset by increases in CRISIL, ICR and RES revenue are historically correlated with the relative strength of the issuance environment and M&amp;A activity, respectively, and the declines we are seeing here are purely indicative of those market conditions. Expenses decreased 19%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management, including lower incentive expenses, partially offset by increased salary and fringe expenses. This resulted in a 41% decrease in segment operating profit and a 750 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin to 55.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 57.9%. Now looking at Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in Ratings revenue were a 44% decrease in Corporates and a 31% decrease in Structured Finance, driven predominantly by structured credit. In addition, Financial Services decreased 20%, Governments decreased 33%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 9%. And now turning to Commodity Insights, revenue increased 5%, driven by strong performance of subscription products, including those within Price Assessments and Energy &amp; Resources, Data &amp; Insights lines. However, that growth was impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As noted on the slide, revenue related to Russia contributed $12 million in the third quarter last year and made no contribution in the third quarter this year. Excluding this impact, Commodity Insights would have grown approximately 8% in the third quarter. There's no change to the expected impact from this conflict. But as a reminder, on an annualized run rate basis, we expect Commodity Insights revenue and operating income to be lower by approximately $52 million and $51 million, respectively. For this quarter, recurring revenue contributed 91% of Commodity Insights revenues.  Expenses increased 1%, primarily due to salary and fringe and an increase in T&amp;E expense partially offset by merger-related synergies, lower consulting spend and lower real estate costs. Segment operating profit increased 9%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 45.8%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 43.8%. Looking across the Commodity Insights business categories, price assessments grew 8% compared to the prior year, driven by continued commercial momentum and strong subscription growth for market data offerings. Energy &amp; Resources, Data &amp; Insights also grew 8% in the quarter, driven by strength in gas, power and renewables and in petrochemicals. Advisory and Transactional Services decreased 1% in the third quarter. The Upstream business was down 2% compared to prior year, mainly driven by higher comps for Software and Analytics products offerings as well as the impact of Russia. Excluding that impact and the impact of FX, Upstream ACV growth would have been positive in the quarter.  In our Mobility division, revenue increased 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued high retention rates and new business growth in CARFAX. For this quarter, recurring revenue contributed 78% of Mobility's total revenue. Expenses grew 5% year-over-year as we have yet to lap planned increases in headcounts, and we saw continued cloud expense growth, which were partially offset by lower data cost and favorable FX. This resulted in a 14% growth in adjusted operating profit and 200 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 40%.  Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for CARFAX as dealerships profitability remain at elevated levels. Manufacturing grew 4% year-over-year, driven by strength in subscriptions and an uptick in the Recall business. Inventory shortfalls continue to temper growth as OEMs spend on marketing initiatives powered by Mobility products remains muted. Financials and other increased 9%, primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting products and new business. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices revenue increased 3% year-over-year with strong margin expansion despite lower assets under management. For the third quarter, recurring revenue contributed 84% of the total for indices. During the quarter, expenses were roughly flat as strategic investments and higher information services costs were offset primarily by lower incentives and other expenses. Segment operating profit increased 5%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 70.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 68.8%. Asset-linked fees were down 5%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs. Exchange-rated derivative revenue increased 37% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including a more than 60% increase in S&amp;P 500 Index options volume. Data &amp; Custom Subscriptions increased 10%, driven by new business activities. Over the past year, market depreciation totaled $472 billion. ETF AUM net inflows were $194 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.3 trillion, which is an 11% decrease compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which decreased 4% year-over-year. As a reminder, revenue tends to lag changes in asset prices. Given the declines across equity markets so far in the back half of this year, we continue to expect softness in asset-linked fees as we close out 2022. Engineering Solutions revenue declined 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by the negative impact of the timing of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. The BPVC contributed approximately $1 million in revenue this quarter compared to approximately $8 million in the year ago period. For this quarter, 94% of Engineering Solutions revenues were classified as recurring. Adjusted expenses decreased 7% due to favorable impact on BPVC royalties. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 19.1%. Non-subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions decreased 63% year-over-year for the reasons I mentioned on the previous slide, while subscription revenue increased 3% over the same period.  Now moving to our guidance. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. And this slide depicts our updated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance due to the continued softening of the issuance environment, we now expect revenue to decrease mid-single digits compared to our prior guidance. Some of that impact is offset by the outperformance in indices. The net impact of our lower ratings revenue expectations, combined with the cost measures and capital allocation measures we have outlined today result in our slightly lower margin outlook and a new adjusted EPS range of $11 to $11.15. This margin outlook reflects our continued expectation for approximately 180 basis points of margin expansion outside of our Ratings business. Interest expense is expected in the range of $345 million to $355 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance due to higher interest on our cash deposits and positive impact from currency hedges. We're also reducing our outlook for capital expenditures to $115 million due to intentional delays in real estate investments. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, is now expected to be approximately $4 billion. The following slide illustrates our guidance by division. Based on this past quarter's performance, we're updating our expectations for adjusted revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin for Ratings and Indices. The guidance ranges for our other divisions are unchanged.  In closing, despite the geopolitical tensions and a challenging macroeconomic environment weighing on the markets, our portfolio of strong businesses continue to prove resilient. Furthermore, I'm pleased with the progress our teams have made since the closing of the merger earlier this year. We look forward to providing you with a deep dive into our businesses and the longer-term outlook of the company at our Investor Day on December 1.  And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Mark Grant Thank you, Ewout. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question comes from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Owen Lau For the MI Credit Risk Solutions and Data &amp; Advisory Solutions, could you please unpack a little bit on the products and services driving that growth in current backdrop? Are they new customers? Because based on my understanding, many of these products are subscription based. I just want to get a better sense of how you can further monetize it and drive that growth? Douglas Peterson Hi, Owen, this is Doug, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start, first of all, by mentioning that within Market Intelligence, Credit and Risk Solutions has always been a long-term outperformer. It's an area that we see very high demand from the markets for information about credit risk and other types of risk, especially in this market. As you know, the core products in this area are the basic products that are providing information from the Ratings business. So things like RatingsDirect, RatingsXpress. We also have a suite of products like Credit Analytics. And we do see a lot of growth now related to credit climate analytics. This is an area where we're seeing increased interest and demand, especially from financial institutions, especially large global banks.  In addition, we're seeing some other growth from areas like traded market risks some names of, I'll say, ex VA, CCR. We have a VAR product, et cetera. And then we have some additional buy-side risk opportunities for clients to look at for market risk and stress scenarios. So if you look at the entire suite of products, we're able to provide the market information at the time when they really want to understand risk. Owen Lau Got it. That's very helpful. And then my follow-up is somehow related to the Ratings business. Could you please talk about your view on how private credit market might have impacted S&amp;P Global Rating business? And how S&amp;P can provide services in this area. Douglas Peterson Yes. Thanks. On the private markets, as we saw earlier this year, there was a retreat of institutional investors and retail investors from credit funds. So there was really no liquidity at the beginning part of this year. It was a combination of people that were risk averse and also looking at the shift between fixed and floating. There were a lot of moves in interest rates. So we saw a retreat from the traditional loan funds and high-risk investors that left the markets. That left an opportunity for the private credit funds that had traditionally been focusing on mid-market credit. So SME credit was their expertise. Many of them also had started moving into the higher quality, higher level of risk and large-cap companies. So they were there to fill the gap. The gap was filled by private credit at the beginning of the year. And we know that they've also been able to take on loans with a faster, also with a higher risk level. And so we've seen that increase during the year. Now how do we think about that? First of all, we look at that as an opportunity for us going forward. We believe that the private credit funds will be looking over time to have some sort of risk transformation, whether it's related to fixed floating or it has to do with securitization or syndication. We think at that time, they're going to be wanting some Estimate services, potentially Rating services. In addition, we've identified private credit as one of our most important strategic growth drivers. We already have a base of private credit businesses that were part of IHS Markit. And related to that, we have a strong starting point with products like iLEVEL provides information to portfolio managers. So we've identified private credit is a growth area for us for ratings as well as for Market Intelligence going forward. And we're watching the trend very carefully. We know at some point, investors will come back to the markets, and we'll see a broadening of the market again. But we've been watching this very closely and are actually interested in this as a growth area for us. Operator Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Ashish Sabadra  I wanted to drill down further on the Ratings and the issuance guidance. I believe my back of math -- envelope math suggests that you're assuming a similar growth in fourth quarter as third quarter for transaction revenues. I just wanted to see if I'm in the right ballpark I was just wondering if you could provide any color on what your expectations are for issuance for the rest of the year. Are you assuming any rebound? And how are the conversations with the issuers coming along? Ewout Steenbergen Ashish, if you look at the outlook, as you know, we are not really providing quarterly guidance. So we're not really speaking about the quarterly outlook for either our financial results or some of the input variables like issuance. But of course, if you look at the numbers that we put out today, then if you would do a backward calculation, you would assume that the most recent trends we are seeing in terms of issuance is what we expect to continue also in the fourth quarter. So, definitely, that’s the main reason why we took our guidance down. I would say that's the only reason, because overall the impact on our results from a top line perspective is about $200 million reduction in revenue outlook for the Ratings business, so about $0.50 of EPS. And then there were a couple of smaller things. But net-net, I think that's the main driver of why the EPS outlook is down for the full year. Ashish Sabadra That's very helpful color. And maybe just switching gears on Mobility, pretty strong momentum there despite what we are seeing in the auto lending space or in the auto space. And so I was just wondering, as we start to see the demand for auto slow down, how should we think about the growth in the business? Is there some counter-cyclicality as well here in the business? Douglas Peterson  Yes, Ashish, thank you for your questions. When it comes to Mobility, we see that there's a very interesting shift going on over the last couple of years. As you know, when the market started slowing down from the pandemic and the supply chain interruptions, we saw the used auto market really start expanding and we benefited from the CARFAX products and the CARFAX suite of products, especially at the dealer level. We know that there's some counter-cyclicality as you say, it as the market returns to new autos coming into the market and inventories rise that we will benefit from products and services to the OEMs and as well as the dealers are going to start having a different type of relationship again with the manufacturers and suppliers.  So we're watching right now very closely three big trends in the automotive market: what's happening with the used car market where we have a strong position, what's happening with the OEMs and the supply chain for the new automobiles. They've been in historic lows over the last two years. So we expect that's going to start going up. And then there's also a transformation taking place in the industry as more and more vehicles start to become electric based with the drivetrain as opposed to internal combustion. So a lot of trends, which are all play to our advantage because we have data analytics and research products that we can serve all of the users in these markets. Operator Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Alex Kramm I understand that you don't really want to comment much on 2023 quite yet, I guess, we'll wait until December. Just on the issuance side, however, your own research group yesterday put out not only the 2022 update but also the 2023 initial look, which I think calls, if I got this right, for 2% issuance growth and 10% growth, in particular, for the Corporate side, which I think is the most important for you. So since this is out there, I'm just wondering how we should be thinking about that forecast? And what's kind of items you would think about as you think about how that flows into billed issuance and revenues? I know it's early, but given that your own company has an issue outlook out there already, figured it's relevant. Douglas Peterson  Yes. Thanks, Alex. As you say, we produce a report. And what we're looking at right now is, understanding what are going to be the main factors driving us towards the end of the year. We've given you those in that report as well. That showed that issuance was expected to be down by 19% for the full year, which compared to 16% from our last report. As you know, we will wait to provide guidance for 2023 until February when we provide our full issuance report as well as our guidance for the year. What you saw from the report from our team, our credit research team is product research and it's not necessarily geared directly to how we're going to find billed issuance. As you recall, last quarter, we explained very clearly what is included in billed issuance. We take the -- what would be expectations for issuance overall. We add in leveraged loans. And then we extract some debt areas like unrated categories such as MTNs, most of the domestic debt from China. And we also exclude the international public finance from those calculations to come up with our expectations. But maybe more importantly to your question, we're always in the market.  As you saw, we talked about having had 3,000 interactions with the markets during the quarter. We are all over the market to understand what are the factors that are going on that are driving issuance and will drive issuance. So we do provide our guidance going forward. But we're looking at the issuance forecast, GDP growth, macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rates. We're looking at spreads, which have been quite high over the last few quarters. Maturity schedules, which are quite encouraging going forward into 2023, '24, '25, et cetera, M&amp;A pipeline. So as you know, at the time we come out with our guidance, we will have looked at all of these factors. But maybe the most important point is that we're not just standing around and waiting. We're very actively engaged with the markets. Alex Kramm All right. Fair enough. Then maybe just going to Market Intelligence. I think since the deal was announced or closed, I think we have had this expectation that more and more of the, I guess, subscriptions on the IHS Markit side will be moving onto our S&amp;P kind of enterprise umbrella. So just wondering if that's still true, if there's a time line for moving more and more that legacy market subscription under that S&amp;P umbrella. And yes, how far we're along if you're able to pick up any sort of incremental pricing as you do that? Or how should we think about that transition over time, if that is a plan? Douglas Peterson  Yes, Alex, it's very, very early for us to talk about it. But what I'll tell you is going back to the last comment I made that we're incredibly linked into the markets right now. We have all of our commercial teams are out speaking with our customers. What we're finding is that there's a lot of opportunities for us to start with cross-sell. So our initial early wins have been with cross-sell, selling different products within the divisions and sometimes across the divisions. But we are hearing opportunities for moving data into the Desktop, finding some products for data and research and analytics fit together. So to your point, it's a vision that we have, but it's really early for us to give you any kind of detailed analytics about it. Operator Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan  I wanted to ask about Ratings margins. They were down sequentially, but they were still really resilient just given the environment and especially relative to one of your big competitors. Just wanted to ask you if you could talk about some drivers that enabled you to flex cost outside of incentive comp? Ewout Steenbergen Toni, you're right. We are quite pleased with the overall expense discipline of the company in the third quarter. You've heard us announce last quarter that we're taking additional actions to deal with the macro environment and we're actually really pleased how that is playing out, and you may continue to see that kind of a result from us going forward across the company. And of course, we take the benefit also from the cost synergies that we can implement and accelerate during this period. So if you look specifically at the Ratings business, it is a mix. On the one hand, we continue to make sure that we invest in future growth, making sure that we stay competitive on a compensation perspective. We want to preserve the capacity we have on the analytical side.  But on the other hand, there are also discretionary costs that we are bringing down. There are allocated costs that are benefiting from the synergies that we are realizing across the company, and then also incentive compensation is down year-over-year. So it's actually a balance of different elements that go into the mix. But definitely, as you have seen in the past, we're always focused in terms of trying to preserve margins in our business businesses as much as possible, particularly in more challenging macro environments. Toni Kaplan Great. And this is a little bit of a broad question and you could take it where you want. But just -- could you talk about any changes in customer behavior over the last six months, and this could be elongation of the sales cycle in some places? Or maybe it's just different products that have been more in demand? Just wanted to get a sense of sort of changes in the businesses over the last recent history? Douglas Peterson Yes. Toni, thanks for that question. And as you know, the markets are going through a lot of uncertainty and turmoil. We've never lived through a period where you have an end of a pandemic, a war, inflation, interest rates going up, all sorts of different impacts. I mentioned earlier on the mobility discussion what kind of impact that's had on the markets overall. We've seen this interest in talking about risk. It's a topic which has increased dramatically. When we meet with customers, they want to talk about the external environment. They want the expertise of S&amp;P Global that comes from our entire company to understand what's happening with risk, with markets, with credit as well as equities, commodities. So we start with very broad dialogues. And then we dig deeper into some specific topics. One that comes up in almost every single conversation we have is energy transition, climate and sustainability. That's a really common discussion. It's increasing in terms of how much time we spend on it.  And another one is Data and Analytics. How are customers thinking about their own application of AI, Data and Analytics? They want to learn from us how we're managing S&amp;P Global, but they also want to learn how they can be deploying new types of products and services using more AI. But overall, we have not seen any kind of initial pushback on slowing down a sales cycle. Clearly, there are some markets, as I mentioned, the ratings market, there's not a lot of issuance right now, but we've stayed engaged with the market. But maybe net-net, the big topics we spent a lot of time on the macroeconomic environment, sustainability as well as AI and data. Those are big conversations we have in almost every customer interaction. Operator Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey Silber  I wanted to start with a Ratings-related question. I asked your competitor -- your large competitor the same question. I'm just wondering like your thoughts. What are you looking for in terms of signs of an uptick in that market, green shoots, et cetera? What should we be focusing on? Douglas Peterson  There's a few things that I'm focusing on myself, and I know that if we had our Ratings team specifically on the call, they might tell me that there's others that are looking at beyond that. But clearly, there's a set of factors, M&amp;A activity is one for me, which is -- it's kind of an informal indicator. M&amp;A activity has been quite weak recently. Typical M&amp;A has a set of transactions come along with it, may be a bridge loan, which turns into a deal loan, which turns into a bond or rated loan, et cetera. M&amp;A activity has been weak. IPOs is another one. The reason I look at those myself is that those are just their activity, which denotes confidence in the markets that people are willing to invest. But then as you recall, we're having conversations with issuers. We mentioned 3,000 that we had last quarter with issuers. And we see a lot of interest in investing people that have plans for investing in new markets for innovation, for investing in venture capital, ways that they can see new shoots in their own businesses. So we're watching when is it that people actually pull the trigger. And maybe the takeaway is it's not, if it's when. We know that there's a lot of people out there that are ready to go. They have great ideas, but the question is when will those conditions of interest rates, of stability of market confidence, when will those be back when people start going back to the market.  Finally, we do look at the maturity schedules, and we know that there's a point starting towards the middle of next year that there will be maturity schedules are going to start kicking in and we're going to watch that carefully as well. We'll there be pull forward from that, but that's another factor we're going to be watching. Jeffrey Silber  Okay. That's really helpful. And I can shift over to the Mobility line of business. Margins, at least by our record, looks like it hit an all-time high, even I think compared to IHS's business, and I know it's a different segment right now. But can you talk about what's going on there? And should we expect margins to continue to go higher from here? Ewout Steenbergen  Jeff, we are always aspiring to improve margins across all of our businesses. So mobility is not an exception to that. That is because of the fact that we're focused on operating leverage. We always like to see the top line growing faster than the expense line. And of course, aided then by strategic investments to aim for future growth as well. What we are seeing in the mobility business is really a positive overall environment that helps and is very supportive for the business, particularly with low inventory levels, we see margins high for the OEMs and for the dealers and that is driving high retention rates. The offset of that is that we see lower spend for sales and marketing products that we are having, and that's because of the same factor that the inventory levels are low. So you could say there's a kind of an inherent hedge in that business. If the market starts to turn, if we see that the demand supply starts to shift in the car market, then we would also see those different revenue streams moving in opposite directions. But we think that with that, we're insulated from our overall financial impact, and therefore, we can continue to focus on margin expansion as well.  And as Doug mentioned before, we also are taking a benefit from used car markets, and that has been proven to be quite resilient the cycle. So yes, overall, we are really happy with the growth of mobility, the margins, and we would see that continuing going forward. Operator Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. George Tong Billed issuance was down 40% in the third quarter. You're assuming full year billed issuance declines of 45% to 50% will be worse than the third quarter decline. What are you seeing that suggests 4Q could potentially be worse than 3Q in terms of billed issuance? Any color there would be helpful. Douglas Peterson  Yes. First of all, let me just give a little bit more color on that. As you know, at the last forecast, we saw that issuance of the non-financials or Corporates would be down about 30%. We now see it down about 35%. And then we see that in Financial Services, they had expected to be down 10%, now down about 14% or so. When you look at the total billed issuance, and we mentioned that it was going to -- year-to-date was down 42% and we're expecting it to be down now 45%, this is going to be based on what we see in the pipeline.  As I mentioned in the answer I gave a few minutes ago, we see that the market itself is quite hesitant. It's not a question of, if, it's a question of when. And we see that during the fourth quarter, what we've picked up from investment banks from issuers directly that right now, they're still waiting to see what the conditions are going to be around economic growth, interest rates and spreads. So it's just based on our forecast, not our issuance forecast. This is based on our market forecast based on people that are meeting with issuers and meeting with investors that the current conditions are still such that people are holding back before they go to market. George Tong Very helpful. And related to that, we're likely going to be in a higher interest rate environment for some time relative to pre-COVID. What are your thoughts on whether corporates may enter a phase of balance sheet delevering and implications for issuance performance. Douglas Peterson  Yes, that's a theoretical question, but let me go back and look at history. I know that many of us have been in the market for many years, remember when interest rates were 4%; 3%, 4%, 5% base rates and the markets were incredibly active. I think that we'll settle into a range once there's stability and we understand what the longer-term rates are going to be, what longer-term inflation and growth are going to be. Companies and financial institutions will go back to the markets because they want to invest and grow. We know that organizations like to grow and to grow, you deploy capital. We also look at the trend around the globe where more and more markets are shifting from being banking markets to capital markets.  Right now, in Europe, there's a couple of shifts going on in the support programs that the ECB was providing to the banks. This was very easy, very low-cost funding. They're starting to wean the banks off of those, and they're going to the capital markets to raise more capital as well as to deploy more capital into bonds instead of into loans. So we see this trend of capital marketization around the globe, and we think that's another trend in the long run that will drive a lot of positive tailwinds for the Ratings business. Operator Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Craig Huber  My first question on pricing, can you just update us on a like-for-like basis? What would you say the average price increase is this year? And how does it vary across the segments? Is it 3% to 4%? Or is a little bit higher? Ewout Steenbergen  Greg. Well, we are always very careful when we speak about pricing in isolation because, first and foremost, we start with customer value. What do we deliver for our customers? And the good news is that based on the very high value of our products and services, we should be able to pass on cost/price increases and to achieve more favorable contract terms and fees over time at renewal. Of course, it depends on facts and circumstances of each and every product, each and every customer situation and of the situation of each and every of our businesses. But that is our overall philosophy. I can't give you specifically a number for across the company, how much price increases are up compared to previous periods, but there are definitely areas where we are looking at price increases or have already implemented price increases that have been higher than in the past. But again, that all has started with that there is a good balance with the overall customer value that we are delivering. Craig Huber  My second question, please, on Market Intelligence. Can you just talk a little further about the health of your clients, the sales pipeline there a little bit further? I mean your numbers speak for themselves. How do you feel about the outlook for Market Intelligence right now? Douglas Peterson  Yes. We still feel very, very positive, and we're optimistic about the Market Intelligence pipeline. You read every one so about some of the financial institutions here and there that might be slowing down some of their growth, but we're not seeing that in terms of negotiations with clients. But very importantly, one of the propositions of the merger between IHS Markit and S&amp;P Global was to cross-sell the excellent products from both groups to the client bases on the other. We believe that we have a strong diversification of our client base. And as an example, in the IHS Markit businesses, their financial services business was mostly focused on financial services. We're finding that a lot of the opportunities and a lot of our initial cross-sell has been selling IHS Markit products to corporate clients. We think that there is a lot of upside and a lot of opportunity. We are out in the market actively talking with our customers about ways we can bring value through new products, new services through data, et cetera. So right now, we're not seeing any pullback or any kind of major slowdown of our sales activities or pushback from clients. Operator Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav Patnaik Maybe just specific to Market Intelligence and the Desktop side. Can you just help us understand the accounting issue, I guess, that will help reaccelerate the growth? And then just thinking out a little bit longer in there, how do you expect the trajectory of the growth there to play? Because I mean, similar to yourselves, I imagine the sell side and other customers will be tightening budgets as well. Ewout Steenbergen  Good morning, Manav. We recognized that the third quarter revenue growth of the Desktop was below our normal growth potential. But you have to look at it from a particular perspective that there is always some timing of revenue recognition of certain contracts. That was particularly impacting this quarter, but we expect the Desktop growth to normalize again in the fourth quarter. Also for Market Intelligence, in general, if you take out the volume effect of the capital markets business, and also FX, then the overall growth for the full quarter was north of 7%, and we believe that's more indicative of the normal growth opportunity for Market Intelligence as well. Manav Patnaik  Okay. Got it. And then can I just ask on the non-transaction side of the Ratings business? It's obviously down 2%, I think you said ex FX. But how long will that keep, I guess, slowly declining? Like when do we lap the Ratings evaluation services, tough comps or whatever it is that's driving that down? Ewout Steenbergen  Well, Manav, that is directly correlated with the overall economic environment, capital markets activity, debt issuance, M&amp;A environment. And we have, of course, seen that the beginning of this year was still relatively strong, and it started to deteriorate somewhere from March onwards. Non-transaction revenue is usually quite stable as a revenue stream. We have two particular areas that are mostly sensitive for the more general macro environment. This is initial credit ratings. We don't see a lot of new issuers coming to the market. And then rating evaluation services, this has a correlation with the M&amp;A market. These are issuers that are thinking about IPOs, spin-offs and so on, want to have some kind of an insight in terms of implications for their ratings. So obviously, those are revenue streams that will come back once the markets start to turn. The more stable elements in non-transaction are around surveillance, around frequent issuer programs. And then most notably, I want to point out that CRISIL is doing very well and is supporting the non-transaction revenue in that category. Operator Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Jeffrey Meuler  I hear you that there's some inherent hedges in the Mobility business, but I think the used car business is a decent amount larger than the new car market for you. So if the market, I guess, shifts back from a mix perspective and some of the profit pools for use target hit, I'm just wondering if there's a net benefit or a net detriment to you? And I recognize CARFAX has good structural growth, historically resilient. So could you just give us any more detail on what product lines the competitive wins and new customer growth was coming in or any more detail on CARFAX's innovation that's driving the growth, given that the core report is fairly well penetrated. Ewout Steenbergen  Jeff, you're absolutely right that the used car market is a significant component of the overall revenue stream for the Mobility business. And the good news there is that it has been a very resilient market through the cycles. So we're not overly concerned about if the cycle in the car market start to turn that it will have a material impact. And as I mentioned before, we have other revenue streams actually that we expect to pick up if the equilibrium in the car market start to change, particularly about our sales and marketing products where we have seen relatively lower growth in the more recent past. The mobility business in general is a phenomenal business. There's a lot of innovation, a lot of new product developments, a lot of good support for our customers. CARFAX is really a gem from my perspective in terms of growth and in terms of innovation and new business activity, very close to the customers, a lot of new business launches and new product launches. So I think this business is in a very good position, and we would expect -- also if the car markets start to turn and go in a different direction, that we see continued good performance from this segment. Jeffrey Meuler  Okay. And then, Doug, you answered the deleveraging question. Can you also give us the historical view of like how much issuance was there in a falling rate environment of bonds being issued that was refinancing debt that wasn't coming due the next, say, three, four years but bonds that had significant duration remaining on them where there was issuance to get the interest expense savings from a falling rate environment. Just I guess on the theoretical that we might not have that type of activity for a while, if you could help me understand roughly if that was meaningful in the past or not? Douglas Peterson  Yes. Basically, this is a question about pull forward. And we saw in 2020 and 2021 during the pandemic, there was what we felt now was structural pull forward. It was a combination of low rates, but probably more importantly, if you are a CFO of any organization, you were not being criticized for having ample liquidity during what people didn't understand was the pandemic as we went into it.  So we did see a lot of structural pull forward during that period. But historically, I think the treasurers and CFOs of organizations are quite thoughtful and looking at their overall funding strategies. And so the funding is not -- when people look at their balance sheet, it's not only just looking at what they have on what their costs are. But the opportunities that organizations have now are much more complex than they used to be. Securitizations, looking at how they're going to use a maturity transformation, what they do in terms of derivatives. So yes, we do see the balance sheets. We do see that there was pull forward into '20 and 2021, but we know the maturities are coming now. And we think that the sort of tools that corporations have to -- and banks have to manage their risk and their liquidity have really changed a lot in the last 10 or 15 years.  So it's hard to go back and compare to history, but we do know what happened in the last few years, where we did see pull forward, but the upcoming maturity schedule, which starts in the second half of 2023 going forward, in a sense it's kind of what was all the issuance that came after the financial crisis, in 2013, '14, '15. Just think about that huge boom of issuance that took place, that's going to start maturing next year. It was a seven-year, 10-year paper. We see a lot of that will start maturing and that -- we know that, that's going to be in the queue very soon. Operator Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy  First, I just wanted to ask about the commodity business. You mentioned climate transition. So it sounds like there are some underlying drivers that are sustainable. I'm curious if you could talk about the cyclical aspects of the business and maybe areas where you're running into tougher comps. And just how sustainable you think the overall growth rate is there? Ewout Steenbergen  Yes. Let me start with giving you an overall perspective on the Commodity Insights business and how it's doing in the current environment, and then I hand it over to Doug more for the energy transition and climate part. So if you look at the overall macro environment, it's very supportive for the Commodity Insight business at this moment. Definitely, where commodity prices are today is benefiting most of our customers. And therefore, we're seeing also, I would say, based on the very attractive proposition of the combined businesses that we have now brought together under the Commodity Insights segment. We're delivering a lot of new opportunities to our customers. And therefore, we have seen really one of the best sales momentums in this business. If I look at actual sales levels, this will probably one of the very best years for the last maybe a decade or so. So very positive trends that we're seeing that is helping Data &amp; Insights that is helping price assessments.  The Global Trading Services business was a little lower this quarter. The main reason there is that we're lapping more difficult comps. But generally, we also see elevated hedging activity on commodity prices, and we're also benefiting from that as well. And then if you look at the upstream business, there, we have seen a turnaround. That was a business that for many years was in a more difficult period. But clearly, our customers are healthier there as well. We see larger CapEx budgets for those customers, and that is helping that business to grow. And we said in our prepared remarks that if you take out the effect of Russia, on a constant currency basis, actually the subscription book of business in the upstream business was growing during the quarter. So overall, very favorable macro environment for Commodity Insights, and that is clearly helping the business this quarter and also in the next couple of quarters. Douglas Peterson  Ewout, I just want to add two points. The first is that all of us know that energy transition is on everyone's mind, whether it's a corporation or government, regulator, financial institution. And as I mentioned earlier, almost every conversation we have talks about this. And where else do you want to go to find about -- learn about energy and energy transition? It's commodity insights of S&amp;P Global. We have the expertise. We have the experts that can talk about current markets, transition markets, and we're finding an incredible amount of engagement. We have conferences. It's one of the areas that Commodity Insights excels at. And we see very high demand for people to participate in those conferences and we're now back in person and the attendance is above the charts. But the second point I want to make is that we're launching new products all the time. Just in the last quarter, we launched some new products that were related to energy transition and new ways to find information about markets. As an example, there's -- in the tanker market, we talked earlier in my -- we had one of our points on our slide showed the low-sulfur fuel oil market, which we -- I remember on an earnings call about three years ago talking about when we launched that and now it's become a benchmark in the market. But in addition, there's things like the carbon accounted tanker rate price assessments, there's interest around the world for understanding freight emissions and what would be under the EU emissions trading system. You're going to need to have much more information for every single tanker and what is its carbon output, and we will have a product for that. As an example, there's a whole information that's needed in Brazil and India and Turkey on energy certificates in emerging markets.  And then finally, we have some examples. Recently, as you know, in the United States, there was the new climate bill, which was issued by the United States, by the Congress. And we've done very special research which is really industry-leading about the clean energy procurement and what that's going to mean for industry. So when it comes to energy and energy transition, we’re the place you want to go. Faiza Alwy  Great. That's all very helpful. Just as a follow-up. Ewout, on Market Intelligence. I think you had you had -- the margin performance was really strong. And I'm curious if -- is that the area where you're maybe getting the most synergies? Or just give us a little bit more color on the margin performance, whether it's mix related? And how we should think about that going forward.. Ewout Steenbergen  Faiza, yes, we're seeing the largest benefit from cost synergies and revenue synergies in the Market Intelligence division. That's because it's the largest division. It's also the largest combination of different businesses that we're bringing together. And also based on the size of that division, it will also benefit, of course, from a large part of the synergies that we're realizing in the corporate center and the allocation of those costs down to the divisions. What you see is, in general, that we continue to invest in Market Intelligence for future growth. So you see new product launches continuing strategic investments in new areas and initiatives. That was already touching on private credit, private markets, ESG investments we're having there as well. We're having expansion still continuing in China, in the marketplace and many different areas that we are continuing to invest as well as cloud expenses. We're also continuing on our cloud journey and Market Intelligence is continuing to invest there as well. But then the opposite factors, there are some of the expense reductions, the expense discipline and the synergies and the combination of all of that led to the significant margin expansion in Market Intelligence. Operator Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Hans Hoffman  This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Stephanie. Could you just comment a bit on what you're seeing across your European revenue base and how that region did relative to your expectations either by segment or overall? Ewout Steenbergen  Yes, overall, not so much of a different trend we are seeing in Europe compared to other parts of the world. I understand the background of the question because definitely, the economic outlook in Europe is, of course, quite difficult given the inflation levels, given, of course, the close proximity to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But overall, from a customer dynamics perspective, overall in terms of commercial activity, we're not seeing a significant difference compared to North America or Asia. Hans Hoffman  Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the revenue synergy side, I guess where have you seen the most success so far and then sort of where do you kind of see the most opportunity? Ewout Steenbergen  Yes. Most success so far, we see in our largest divisions that we're bringing together, Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights in the Index business. It's mostly cross-sell at this moment, which was as expected because cross sell is the introduction of one product group to existing customers and making sure that we can sell new activities there. For example, in Market Intelligence, we had a nice sale of KYC, KY3P product to an existing customer that was more a customer from the legacy S&amp;P Global side where we could sell a product from the legacy IHS Markit side. So just as an example, so we see -- continue to see good cross-sell. At the same time, we're investing in new product development, in system development that will help them with that growth wave going forward. So it's still early, I have to say around revenue synergies, but we are clearly ahead compared to our original expectations. Operator Our next question comes from Russell Quelch from Redburn. Russell Quelch  I just wanted to talk about capital allocation priorities. You still got about $2 billion on cash on the balance sheet and you're on course to generate around $5 billion of free cash flow in '23, I believe consensus. Just wondered where you look to do further M&amp;A? Or do you have enough integrations on your hand such that you can look to return perhaps north of 100% of free cash flow again in '23? Ewout Steenbergen  Overall, no change with respect to our capital philosophy, capital management targets. We think consistency and reliability there is the most important, particularly in this environment. You have seen us continuing with the $12 billion ASR, even despite that we have seen some impact of the current environment on the rating issuance levels we are able to execute on our plans this year. And you may expect the same from us over the next couple of years. So at least 85% of return of capital to our shareholders, a combination of dividends and share buybacks, dividend payout ratio between 20% and 30%. And M&amp;A, the focus is really on small tuck-in and bolt-on, where we see that we can add a nice capability to some of our core strategic focus areas, but nothing large because we first, of course, need to focus on the integration of the large merger and organically building out our businesses. So no changes at all, and we think that is actually the right approach. Russell Quelch  Okay. And then just one housekeeping question, I guess. Given the earlier comment on being able to achieve the lower-than-average rates due to the refinancing of the IHS debt, what's the level of interest that was delivered in Q3, now the right quarterly rate to assume going forward? Ewout Steenbergen  Yes. This is the new run rate with respect to the interest expense on our debt. We were very fortunate with hindsight that we refinanced a large part of the debt at the beginning of March when the 10-year U.S. Treasury was around 1.73 at that point in time. So we are very happy that we locked ourselves in with long-term debt at very low levels. And actually, if you look at the average cost of debt for any player in our industry, we're at one of the lowest levels. So yes, this is the normalized level. If you look, though, at the interest expense line, there's one point that I want to make, it's a net number. So we're generating more interest income on our cash balances. So that is helping us a little bit and obviously, that might fluctuate over time. Operator Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum  Ewout, I just wanted to ask you a little bit about your labor cost trends. Obviously, it's a significant component of costs. Everyone in the industry has been dealing with the rising labor costs given what's going on in the market. What's your outlook for that? And do you see that kind of letting up in terms of just how we should think about the costs of the business on a go-forward basis, let's say, over the next six to 12 months? Ewout Steenbergen Shlomo, obviously, we are exposed as everyone else, to increases from an overall labor market perspective and comp expectations, and we need to stay competitive in order to attract and retain the best talent. So let me expand a little bit on that answer. So about 60% of our overall expense base is people cost. And obviously, we have people across the whole world in many different job groups and categories. It's not a one-size-fits-all. We see more competitive situations in certain markets and jurisdictions. We see it more in certain job groups. And we are continuously making sure that we stay competitive from an overall comp perspective. And we will continue to do that. So we're definitely expecting to see also some of the changes over the next period flowing through our P&amp;L. But at the same time, we are also taking advantage of a lot of levers that we are having and maybe levers that are given to us through the merger.  So we have, of course, the opportunity to realize cost synergies and reduction of headcount is an element to that. So that goes in an opposite direction as well as synergies, cost synergies around real estate, around procurement. And then as you see this year, given the performance of the company, also incentive compensation costs are down and we gave you the overall impact of around $120 million to $140 million. So it is a bit of a mix. On the one hand, staying competitive from a labor market perspective; but on the other hand, using a lot of levers in order to offset the overall impact on our expense line and on our margins. Shlomo Rosenbaum  Okay. And then I just want to ask a little bit more about trying to figure out how far we are from the bottom, just in terms of the Ratings revenue. Doug, you talked about refunding laws becoming more meaningful in the middle of next year. if you take the revenue that you would expect from those refunding walls together with your subscription revenue, that you're getting, say, this year. How far away are you from, let's say, 2022 revenue that you're expecting? In other words, how much further downward you really have to go just to kind of hit that number? Douglas Peterson  Shlomo, we're not really trying to call a bottom or a top to the market. We are also not providing any guidance or outlook for 2023 at this time. As I mentioned, we've been very engaged with the markets with issuers and investors. We're also -- we have world-class economists and experts that are providing us with input. So we're looking at all of that, what you just discussed, but we're -- there's no -- we have no ability to actually call a bottom. Operator We will now take our final question from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman Referring to Slide 38, I just wanted to talk about implied Rating margins for the fourth quarter. To get to that mid-50s rating margin for the full year, my math says it's about 49% Ratings margins for the fourth quarter. Ewout, if you could just please confirm that? And then just help us appreciate the 49% because that's a notable step down from third quarter Ratings margins. Please comment about seasonality or any other factors we would need to understand fourth quarter Ratings margins on Slide 38. Ewout Steenbergen  Andrew, as you understand, we're not giving quarterly guidance, so I can't give you numbers by quarter by segment margins. But what we are, of course, trying to do is if we give you a full year picture, we give you a full year outlook, then of course you can backwards calculate what is the expectation for the quarter itself. I do want to point out that the third quarter in general is the lowest quarter for us from an expense perspective. That is due to seasonality. The fourth quarter is higher. But you have seen that in previous years as well. So from a trend perspective, there's nothing different than what you -- that you should have seen in the past. But sequentially, you should expect expenses to roll out. Again, that is normal seasonality. Douglas Peterson Well, that was the last question. So I'd like to make a quick closing comment. So first of all, thank you, everyone, for joining the call today for your questions and your support. But I'm really pleased with the progress we've made since closing the merger. It's only been 8 months. And we've been able to unify our management team under a strong vision and set of purposes and values. We see strong commercial success. You heard about it on this call, our cross-sell and our product innovation, and we're ahead of schedule to achieve our cost synergies. And all of that in a challenging macroeconomic backdrop where we discuss some of those topics today.  But we also have very important secular trends that are creating opportunities for S&amp;P Global: the energy transition, the continued interest in climate and sustainability, the need for analytics and insights in very turbulent markets. So we're very pleased with our progress, and I'm excited that we'll be able to share more with you on our strategic vision and our multiyear targets at our Investor Day on December 1. But let me end by thanking again our people who are absolutely fantastic, they're world-class. And I want to thank all of you again for joining us on this call today. Thank you very much.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug? Doug Peterson Thank you, Mark. Welcome to today’s second quarter earnings call. Our second quarter results demonstrate the combined efforts of our truly incredible team. After our first 100 days as a combined company, it’s clear than ever that after the merger S&amp;P Global is stronger, more resilient, more diversified and better positioned than ever. We’re maintaining fiscal and operational discipline and controlling what can be controlled, which is allowing us to post aggregate results in a challenging issuance environment that would’ve been inconceivable prior to the merger. Let me start with our financial highlights. As a reminder, the adjusted financial metrics will be discussing today referred to non-GAAP adjusted metrics in the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period. Revenue decreased 5% year-over-year with growth in five of our six divisions providing significant ballast against a 26% decrease in ratings revenue. Recurring revenue increased 5% year-over-year, representing 81% of revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses only increased 1% as continued investment in inflation pressures on compensation and technology were almost entirely offset by cost synergies in the quarter. We’re reinstating our guidance, which reflects the challenging macroeconomic environment. Though, we will be able to offset some of the EPS impact is Ewout will discuss in a moment. Importantly, our updated guidance calls for a smaller than 2% decrease in adjusted EPS at the midpoint, illustrating the resilience of the businesses and the positive impact of our capital allocation strategy. I would also like to share a few other highlights from the second quarter. As I mentioned, we are now more than 100 days past the merger close. Our post integration efforts are proceeding on schedule, but very importantly, we’re outperforming on both cost and revenue synergies. Momentum continues on product development with several areas of innovation that will highlight for you on today’s call. We see benefits from market volatility in parts of our businesses, and we’re able to accelerate our share repurchase efforts relative to our original plan with $8.5 billion near completion at an average share price below $360. We expect to launch an additional $2.5 billion ASR in the coming weeks, which we expect to complete in October with the final $1 billion to be completed by year end. We’ve already seen remarkable progress in our integration efforts in a relatively short period. I’m pleased with our progress in integrating our commercial and marketing teams. We’ve recorded more than 2,000 cross-sell referrals across the divisions. We’re also ahead of expectations on our cost synergies realizing approximately $80 million year-to-date and exiting the quarter in an annualized run rate of more than $260 million. Beyond the transactional milestones related to the merger like the necessary divestitures, we’ve also reached multiple operational milestones. We’ve standardized business practices invested in culture and training and established leadership teams multiple layers deep across the enterprise. We’re moving fast on our office integration plan and consolidated 10 of our office locations around the world lowering our real estate costs. We completed our major New York City consolidation and are on track to complete our London consolidation in the fourth quarter. When we announced the merger, we highlighted our expectation that the combined company would be more agile, innovative, and entrepreneurial. And we’ve seen that in initiatives such as the Data Lake Hackathon led by Kensho’s Head of AI Research and teams of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and software developers. These teams spent two days exploring how to best leverage Kensho tools in other technologies to derive value from the Data Lake datasets and we’re thrilled with what these teams have found in just two days. In addition to finding ways that Kensho solutions can add commercial value to unstructured datasets across the Data Lake. We identified new datasets for training Kensho Scribe, NERD, Link, and Extract, more than doubling current training datasets in some cases. We also identified datasets to improve S&amp;P Global’s country risk assessments and found compelling new ways to classify and improve data for ESG. This hackathon enabled us to better realize the full capabilities of our combined datasets. We also re-launch the cross-divisional S&amp;P Global research council with new leadership and membership to reflect the expertise in our combined company following the merger. This council consists of both research and operational leaders with the core mandate to drive customer value and greater insights for markets. One of the first actions of the council was to align on key research teams that have the greatest potential for large scale disruption and have a meaningful impact on the success of our customers. We’ll be leveraging the full capabilities across the company and engaging meaningfully with customers and other stakeholders across industry and regulatory bodies. There’s incredible demand for insights and thought leadership on topics like energy security, climate, technology and digital disruptions, supply chains, and capital markets. We have unique datasets and insights in all of these areas and we see the research council as a way to make sure that our insights are most impactful for our customers and drive innovation within S&amp;P Global. That focus on accelerating innovation was on full display in the second quarter. We launched exciting new products from commodity insights, including a new basin level methane intensity calculation product for 19 U.S. natural gas production areas. We’re using satellite imagery and data models trained in-house to significantly disrupt what has historically been a very manual process using data extracted from self-reported EPA forms. We also launched carbon intensity measures for all six crude grades in the global Brent benchmark. In Mobility, we saw commercial success from our new auto credit insights product to help deliver insights to financial customers serving the automotive credit space. In Engineering Solutions, we continue to make progress building out our new software platform and have two successful proof-of-concept engagements in market now. We continue to innovate in market intelligence as well, making new datasets available via feeds and introducing new products like PVR Source, which is a diligence platform aimed at helping clients get ahead of the compliance challenges of an ever changing regulatory landscape. Now to recap the financial results for the second quarter, revenue decreased 5% to $2.97 billion. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $1.4 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 280 basis points to 47% as both profits and margins were negatively impacted by the decrease in ratings transaction revenue and the expense growth I mentioned earlier. Importantly, our non-ratings businesses in aggregate posted strong growth in the quarter, increasing revenue by 7% year-over-year. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which is 46.1% as of the second quarter through strong and disciplined execution and prudent capital allocation, we were able to offset much of the earnings impact of the issuance environment posting fully diluted EPS of $2.81, representing a 7% decrease year-over-year. Looking across the six divisions, I’m pleased to report positive growth across five of our divisions with ratings executing very well in an extraordinarily difficult issuance environment. Our more diversified portfolio of products provides many opportunities to thrive in uncertain markets. And we saw double-digit revenue growth in multiple product lines as a result. Within our indices business, we continue to see remarkable strength in our exchange traded derivatives, which grew more than 60% year-over-year, as well as our CDS Indices, which increased 40%. Uncertain in the markets continues to spur demand for our thought leadership and insights and a consolidated platform on which to access information, whether it’s tracking market movements, company performance, or supply chain constraints, our customers continue to come to us for help navigating uncertain waters. This help drive 25% growth in aftermarket research and market intelligence. In the second quarter, we celebrated the second anniversary of the S&amp;P Global marketplace. Customers continue to come to S&amp;P Global as a trusted source for differentiated data around ESG, fundamentals, machine readable text, and workflow tools like our work bench. We’ve seen explosive growth in the marketplace since launch and in the last year, a nearly 30% increase in the content and solutions available, 75% growth in deals closed and more than 200% growth in engagement is measured by page views. Now turning to issuance. During the second quarter, global issuance decreased 37% year-over-year deteriorating further from what we saw last quarter. In the U.S. rated issuance and aggregate decreased 34%, European rated issuance decreased 45%, and in Asia, rated issuance declined 32%. We saw sharp declines in high yield, which was down nearly 80% year-over-year in Asia, and was down more than 80% in the U.S. and Europe. Interestingly, this is the first time that I can recall seeing declines in every category in every region since I’ve been doing earnings calls. We’ve included additional details on the sub components of issuance by region in the slide deck. Each year S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices conducts a survey of assets as depicted in this slide, asset levels and actively managed funds that benchmark against our indices increased 38% to $12.8 trillion as of the end of 2021. Assets and passive funds invested in products indexed to our indices increased 32% to $9.9 trillion. Numerous indices support the $9.9 trillion including the S&amp;P 500, the largest with $7 trillion in assets. We’ve seen strong growth in factor and sector indices as well as many of our ESG and climate related indices. While the S&amp;P 500 still accounts for the majority of AUM, we continue to see strong demand for that historic index among asset managers. We saw even faster growth among our other indices in 2021 evidenced by the fact that the S&amp;P 500 accounted for 71% of indexed AUM in 2021, down from 72% in 2020. While this is historical AUM as of December 2021, we’re very excited about what this slide will look like in the years to come, as we integrate IHS Markit Indices like iBoxx and iTraxx and drive commercial innovation in fixed income and cross asset indices. We delivered extraordinary growth in our ESG initiatives this quarter. ESG revenue growth accelerated on both reported and organic basis in the second quarter, growing 66% year-over-year to reach nearly $52 million. We continue to introduce new ESG related products and product enhancements at a rapid pace. In the second quarter, we saw the launch of multiple ESG and sustainability related ETFs based on our indices. And we ended the second quarter with AUM and ESG ETFs growing 16% year-over-year to approximately $30 billion. Our Indices and Commodity Insights teams continued their collaboration and launched the S&amp;P Battery Metals index. Within ratings, we completed 20 ESG evaluations and 34 sustainable financing opinions driven by strong demand for second party opinions. Lastly, we hosted the S&amp;P Global Sustainable1 Summit with events in several major cities around the world, bringing together leaders from various stakeholder groups to discuss the future of sustainability. Now turning to our outlook. Twice a year, we update our global refinancing study, but given the issuance environment, we wanted to provide a bit more color this quarter. Specifically, there are two impacts to highlight as investors look at total global debt outstanding. The two impacts are average time to maturity and FX rates. When we look at global corporate bond maturities, we see a similar phenomenon to what we have witnessed historically. Over the next three years, we see a decrease in near-term maturities as refinancing push those maturity dates out. We’ve witnessed this phenomena in the July update each year, so we aren’t surprised by it. While total global debt maturing over the next three years is down significantly from six months ago, it’s important to note that debt maturing over the next 10 years is not down significantly, and it starts to increase over the next three to five years. We expect 2024 and 2025 refinancing activity to start next year. This is particularly true for total debt outstanding on an FX adjusted basis. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since January, foreign denominated debt is lowered by 1% when converted to U.S. dollars at July rates. This slide shows total global debt rated by S&amp;P Global of all maturities on a constant currency basis, which increased 2% if measured at January FX rates. While we don’t expect a significant rebound in issuance in a back half of this year, this demonstrates that over the long-term, the public debt markets remain very healthy and have a strong history of resilience. They also reinforce our view that the issuance headwinds we’re seeing in the market now will likely moderate, if not reverse in the future. Now for issuance outlook, S&amp;P Global Ratings Research has updated its bond issuance forecast for the year to reflect a decrease in the second quarter and more conservative assumptions around the back half. Global market issuance is now expected to decline approximately 16% year-over-year within a range of down 9% to down 24% in 2022. This forecast implies an approximate 21% decline in the second half compared to the 11% decline seen in the first half. Non-financials are expected to see a 30% decrease in issuance, partially tempered by a smaller, roughly 10% decrease in financial services issuance. U.S. public finance and structured finance are expected to soften by 12% and 14% respectively and international public finance is expected to be roughly flat. As a reminder, the global debt issuance forecast is a product of the S&amp;P Global Ratings Research team and reflects market issuance, including unrated issuance. We wanted to take the opportunity to explain the different categories of issuance that we discussed from time to time. The most frequently cited forecast is out of our S&amp;P Global Ratings Research team, which I just outlined. But our ratings revenue is more closely tied to S&amp;P build issuance, which is a subset of market issuance. Build issuance includes leverage loans, which are not included in the market issuance forecast. It does not, however, include debt from unrated categories, such as medium-term notes and most domestic debt from China, nor would our build issuance include international public finance. While there are other nuances as well, these differences in aggregate bridge the gap between our market issuance forecast and the assumption for build issuance that underpins our ratings revenue guidance for the year. As Ewout will outline, our ratings revenue guidance assumes a 30% to 45% decrease in build issuance. Looking beyond issuance, we see a number of secular trends that stand to benefit the company both this year and beyond. Our experts in Commodity Insights expect oil prices in volatility to remain above historical norms for some time. This volatility often creates more demand among customers for price assessments and benchmarks, as well as our data and insights. Our Mobility team also expects light vehicle sales to increase next year and beyond, returning to levels more in line with pre-pandemic production by 2025. As volumes continue to grow, we expect to see tailwinds in our Mobility segment across multiple product lines, including CARFAX and Automotive Mastermind. As we evaluate the remainder of this year, however, we wanted to discuss some of the assumptions that underpin our outlook. As we noted in June, when we suspended guidance, we’ve seen a deterioration several economic indicators over the course of the second quarter. We expect slightly lower GDP growth, higher inflation, and a lower debt issuance environment to impact not only our businesses, but our customers, as well. As Ewout will discuss in a moment, we’re seeing inflationary pressure on our costs with approximately 70% of our expenses tied to headcount. That pressure is showing up most in our compensation and technology costs. As a reminder, this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all metrics that inform our outlook, but we wanted to help investors understand the changes in some of the assumptions that we make about the global economy when formulating guidance. While we’re not discussing 2023 or beyond on today’s call, we’re pleased to announce an Investor Day that we expect to hold on December 1 in New York City. We’re looking forward to sharing with you some preliminary views on 2023, as well as a more holistic update on our strategy positioning and medium term financial targets at that time. Before, handing it over to Ewout, I’d like to reiterate how pleased we are with the progress we’re making on integration and the clear proof points we see reinforcing the industrial logic of the merger and the resilience of our businesses. We have a world-class team and appreciate the hard work and dedication of our people in every area across the firm. Our teams continue to execute incredibly well evidenced by our early outperformance on synergies. And we believe we’re positioning the company to accelerate growth, expand margins and deliver innovation in the years to come. With that, I’ll turn it over to Ewout, to walk through the results and guidance. Ewout? Ewout Steenbergen Thank you, Doug. With five of our six divisions, once again, posting revenue growth, we continue to see evidence that we are a stronger, more resilient company. Doug highlighted the headline financial results. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. As Doug mentioned, the adjusted financial metrics that we will be discussing today, refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude a contribution from divested businesses in all periods. Adjusted corporate and allocated expenses declined from a year ago, caused by synergies as well as a combination of reduced incentive and fringe cost, as well as the release of certain accruals. Our net interest expense increased 3%, as we increased gross debt partially offset the lower average rates due to refinancings. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the post merger change in the mix of income by jurisdiction. As most are aware, we exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the second quarter were $220 million in merger-related expenses. The details of which can be found in the appendix. We generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items of $924 million. We remain committed to returning the majority of this cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share purchases. Year-to-date, as Doug mentioned, we have repurchased $8.5 billion in shares, and we expect to launch an additional $2.5 billion in the coming weeks. We expect that $2.5 billion will be completed in October with the final $1 billion to be completed by year-end. We note that U.S. dollar has strengthened against many foreign currencies year-to-date, and we have seen a corresponding impact on both our revenue and expenses. Approximately three-fourth of our international revenue is invoiced in U.S. dollars, which provides some protection to revenue against FX volatility. In addition to the natural hedges that exist due to the global footprint of our people, we have an active hedging program in place that further mitigates the ultimate impact on our earnings. Year-to-date, we have seen an unfavorable revenue impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and British Pound. Expenses saw a favorable impact due to FX movements against those same currencies and the Indian Rupee. Turning to expenses, as we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to prudent management of the P&amp;L and shareholder capital. This year, we have already taken decisive actions to protect margins where we can, while still preserving our investments to drive future growth. Actions taken include a reduction in incentive accruals pull forward in synergies, adjustments to the timing of select investments, forcing selective hiring, and limiting consulting spend in some areas. We remain committed to our strategic investments, which are key to the growth of our business. These include investments in our people, innovation, infrastructure, and our ability to execute merger-related integration and synergies. Looking at the year-over-year change in expenses this quarter, we’re clearly seeing the impact of inflation, most notably in compensation expenses. We’re also seeing higher cloud and T&amp;E cost as we highlighted last quarter as well. Even with those headwinds, the decisive actions I outlined, together with our acceleration of synergies and favorable FX have allowed us to keep expenses relatively flat year-over-year. Now, I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the second quarter, we have achieved $80 million in cumulative cost synergies and our current annualized run rate is $260 million. Through the combined efforts of our teams across the divisions and corporate, we’re very pleased to see we’re outperforming our initial timeline on both revenue and cost synergies year-to-date. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the second quarter is $540 million. Our teams have been diligent and disciplined and have pulled forward some of the synergies we previously identified without materially impacting our ability to drive growth and revenue synergies. We have previously said that we expect to realize in 2022, approximately 35% to 40% of the $600 million in cost synergies, we’re targeting through 2024. We’re still operating in an uncertain environment. So while we’re not changing the expected range for 2022, we’re confident that we’re more likely to come out at the higher end of the 35% to 40% target range. Now let’s turn to the deficient results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 7% with growth across all product lines. We want to emphasize the increased resilience and stickiness of most of our revenue and the more diversified portfolio of products in our deficient post merger. To highlight this improvement, we know that in Market Intelligence recurring revenue, which includes variable recurring revenue accounted for 96% of total revenue this quarter, slightly higher compared to the same period last year. Expenses increased 6% primarily due to increases in compensation expense, cloud spent and outside services, offset by cost synergies and lower incentive compensation. Market Intelligence remains the biggest drive of cost synergies from the merger and the synergy outperformance we have seen year-to-date. Segment operating profit increased 8% and the segment operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 33%. On a trailing 12 month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 30.2%. You can see on the slide, our operating profit from the OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division. The JV contributed $25 million in adjusted operating profit to the company because the JV is a 50%-owned joint venture operating independent of the company. We do not include the financial results OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category and on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 6%, Data And Advisory Solutions revenue grew 9%, Enterprise Solutions revenue grew 2%, and Credit and Risk Solutions revenue grew 10%. For Enterprise Solutions, we continue to see headwinds in several of our volume driven products that rely on equity and debt capital markets activity, and the variable subscription terms. Excluding the impact of these volume driven products, growth across Market Intelligence would've been approximately 8% year-over-year in the quarter. We expect those volume driven headwinds to persist through the rest of the year. While we are pleased with the outperformance of credit and risk solutions in the first half, we're lapping some difficult columns in the second half and expect revenue growth to decelerate in debt part of the business. Ratings faced continued difficult market conditions this quarter, with revenue declining 26% year-over-year. Expenses decreased 6%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management, including lower incentive expenses, as well as lower occupancy cost and favorable FX, partially offset by increased salary and fringe expenses and T&amp;E spent. This resulted in a 35% decrease in segment operating profit and 850 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 12-month basis adjusted segment operating profit margin was 59.8%. Non-transaction revenue increased 2% on a constant currency basis and decreased 1% as reported primarily due to lower initial credit ratings and ratings evaluation services revenues, partially offset by increases in CRISIL and annual fees. Transaction revenue decreased 44% on the continued soft issuance already discussed. This slide depicts ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in ratings revenue were a 39% decrease in corporates and a 20% decrease in structured finance, driven predominantly a structured credit. In addition, financial services decreased 9%, governments decreased 15% and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 4%. However, debt growth was impacted significantly by the suspension of commercial activity in Russia and Belarus, and other impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Adjusting for the impact of that conflict revenues would have grown approximately 7% compared to prior year. On an annualized run rate basis, this conflict is expected to impact CI revenue and operating income by approximately $52 million and $51 million respectively. For this quarter, 90% of Commodity Insights revenues were classified as recurring. Expenses increased 4% primarily due to salary and fringe, and increase in T&amp;E expense, partially offset by realization of merger related synergies. Segment operating profit increased 3% and the segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 44%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 43.3%. Looking across the Commodity Insights business categories, price assessments grew 5% compared to prior year driven by strong subscription growth for market data offerings and continued commercial momentum. We also saw strong performance from advisory and transactional services, and energy and resources, data and insights, both growing 4% respectively. Upstream data and insights increased marginally with second quarter 2022, representing the third consecutive quarter of ACV growth, when adjusting for the impact of Russia. In our Mobility division revenue increased 7% year-over-year driven primarily by strength in planning solutions and used car offerings. For this quarter 78% of mobility's revenues were classified as recurring. Expenses grew 5%, unplanned increases in headcount and advertising expense, which were somewhat offset by reduction in purchase data and office cost, and incentive compensation. This resulted in a 9% growth in adjusted operating profit and 90 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 39.5%. Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong performance from CARFAX and very high dealer retention as well as growth in new stores. Growth in manufacturing was 3% year-over-year driven by demand for supply chain products among suppliers though growth are tempered by relatively flat original equipment manufacturer or OEM spent on marketing initiatives powered by mobility products. Financials, and other increased 3% primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting products tempered by slowing consumer activity and persistent low volumes across auto sales. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth of 12% year-over-year primarily due to gains in ETD volumes. For this quarter, 83% of Indices revenues were classified as recurring during the quarter expenses increased 1% due to increased technology and T&amp;E expense. Segment operating profit increased 16% and the segment operating profit margin increased 290 basis points to 71.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin are 68.6%. Once again, every category increased revenue this quarter, asset-linked fees were up 5% primarily from AUM driven gains in mutual funds and ETFs. Exchange traded derivative revenue increased 64% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including the more than 60% increase in S&amp;P 500 index options volume. Data and custom subscriptions increased 6% driven by new business activities. Over the past year, ETF AUM net inflows were $231 billion and market depreciation totaled $352 billion. This resulted in quarter ending ETF AUM of $2.5 trillion, which is a 5% decrease compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM which increased 5% year-over-year. Revenue tends to lack changes in asset prices, which helped drive outperformance this quarter. However, we expect asset-linked fees to decrease in the back half of this year, sequentially versus the end of the first quarter ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $6 billion in marketed depreciation totaled $436 billion. Within our Engineering Solutions division, we saw 3% revenue growth driven primarily by growth in non-subscription offerings. Most notably the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. For this quarter 93% of Engineering Solutions revenues were classified as recurring. Adjusted expenses, increased 5% driven by investment in product development and increased royalties. This resulted in a 7% decline in segments operating profit and 300 basis points contraction to margin. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 19.4%. Subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions increased 2% year-over-year, while non-subscription revenue increased 10% over the same period. As you look toward next quarter for Engineering Solutions, it will be important to remember we'll lap the August 2021 duplication of the BPVC, which typically contributes approximately $8 million in the third quarter of odd years, but is not published in even years. Now moving to our guidance. And this slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. And this slide depicts our reinstated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance. For revenue, we now expect a low-to-mid single digit decrease year-over-year, reflecting the issuance environment, partially offset by the strength we're seeing in our non-ratings businesses. We now expect corporate and allocated expense between $70 million and $80 million, approximately $15 million lower than our previous guidance on lower forecasted incentive compensation. This drives our expectation for adjusted operating margins between 45.3% and 45.8% as declines in high margin ratings revenue disproportionately impacts margins to the downside this year. We wanted to emphasize the margin expansion we expect to see elsewhere in the business. In aggregate within our five non-ratings divisions, we expect approximately 180 basis points of operating margin expansion this year. Interest expense is expected in the range of $360 million to $370 million, in-line with our most recent guidance. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $165 million and free cash flow excluding certain items in a range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. The following slide illustrates our guidance by division. We now expect adjusted revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin in the following ranges. For Market Intelligence, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digit range and margins in the low-30%. For Ratings, we now expect revenue declines in the low-to-mid 20% range and margins in the mid-to-high 50%. For Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the mid single digit range and margins in the mid 40%. For Mobility we expect revenue growth in the high single digit range and margins in the high 30%. For Indices we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digit range and margins in the mid-to-high 60%. For Engineering Solutions, we expect low single digit revenue growth and margins in the mid-teens. In closing this quarter provides further proof of the resilience of our business. Our ability to outperforming synergies speaks volumes on the focus and discipline of the teams we have at S&amp;P Global. Those teams combined with a phenomenal set of truly differentiated products and capabilities position us well to drive profitable growth in the years to go. And with that Let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Question-and-Answer Session A - Mark Grant Thank you, Ewout. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question. Operator Thank you. Our first question is from Ashish Sabadra, you may go – with RBC Capital. You may go ahead. Ashish Sabadra Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering for the issuance guidance, would it be possible for you to provide some color around how we should think about third versus fourth quarter momentum in the back half of the year? Thanks. Doug Peterson Hi, Ashish. This is Doug. Thanks for the question. Let me just give you first of all, some overall view of what we've given you today. We provided you with information starting with our ratings credit research team, and then gave you some new disclosure about how we look at the difference between that research report and what we call our build issuance assumptions. We see right now, the beginning of the third quarter was actually quite weak. One month doesn't make a quarter, but at the beginning of July, there was issuance of high yield loans and high yield debt was down overall in the high-80%, low-90% range. Investment grade issuance was up actually for the month, but the quarter is off to a, what I'd say is still a pretty weak start, answering your question specifically. Ashish Sabadra That that's very helpful color. And then on the cost synergies, obviously pretty strong execution on that front with almost a $260 million run rate achieved in the quarter. I understand you expect to achieve at the high end of that 40% range being realized by 2022, but I was also wondering if you could only provide any color on how we should think about the run rate of cost synergies exiting 2022. Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen Ashih Good morning. This is Ewout. So 40% of $600 million, so we expect therefore in year 2022, approximately $240 million benefit from cost synergies. We think that's phenomenal that we're already having that pace of execution and integration of our organizations. We don't have a precise number for you in terms of the run rate exit, but you should expect that it is a significant amount above the $240 million, because obviously the more we execute this year, the better we are positioned for 2023. So I can't give you a precise number on that, but that will be a number significantly north of that $240 million. Ashish Sabadra That's very helpful color. Thanks. Mark Grant Thanks Ashish. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Manav Patnaik, you may go – with Barclays. You may go ahead. Manav Patnaik Thank you. Good morning guys. My first question was just broadly on guidance, I think, Ewout said that the non-ratings businesses should help offset the ratings weakness, but I think in the guidance summary, you pretty much lowered some of the non-ratings businesses, at least to the lower end. So can you just talk about, that gap and perhaps your level of conserve you've taken in this attempted guidance today? Ewout Steenbergen Manav, good morning. Yes. We have always said that our businesses are very resilient, but of course they're not immune to an external environment. So is some slight impact you are seeing in terms of, for example the Index business, the assumption for the second half of the year is that assets under management will remain flat from the June 30 point. So that will have an impact on the index business. So there's several of those. Another example is the Russia impact on Commodity Insights. But overall these impacts are relatively minimal and modest. So let me give you a few other data points with respect to the assumptions that have gone into the guidance. So as already mentioned, build issuance negative 37%, then for the market appreciation flat to the June 30 level, exchange traded derivative, we expect those to be up about 10% from the second half of 2021 that is lower growth than you have seen in the first half of the year. And the reason is that the comps become more difficult, but also when there is a period of extended volatility, we expect this trading to taper off at some point. And then the brand overall[ph] price to remain in range bound until end of the year. Having said that if you look at the overall performance of the company, we're actually really pleased with the outlook for five of our six division. They are expected to perform very well to be very strong, expenses to be more or less flat year-over-year, which we think is really a phenomenal outcome in a high inflationary environment. And then margins excluding ratings to be up for the full year 180 basis points. So overall we think these are actually really strong outlooks for the company, taking aside of course the market impact for ratings. Manav Patnaik Got it. And then maybe if I can ask you a similar question on the margin front, I mean, you talked about obviously a lot of the cost synergies being ahead of schedule, et cetera, but I think you've still taken the margin outlook down mostly. So is that just maybe being conservative or the run rate doesn't kick in for a while, I guess? Ewout Steenbergen Well we are seeing a lot of dynamics in the overall expenses of the company. We have pointed at some inflationary pressures on compensation, on some of our procurement, elements and other parts of the company, but we are in a very fortunate position that we have so many levers as a company, particularly the levers that are being given to us due to the merger with respect to the cost synergies, duplication of roles that we can eliminate, the volume benefits in terms of synergies in the procurement and the sourcing area, some of the consolidation of real estate and many other areas, plus the decisive management actions we're taking at this moment. So being flat with expenses as I just said, in this environment we think is a very strong outcome. The non ratings businesses were achieving about $200 million or north of $200 million of margin expansion in the second quarter. And we think 180 basis points margin expansion for the full year would be a very strong outcome and would position us very well for 2023. Manav Patnaik Okay. Got it. Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks Manav. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may go ahead. Alex Kramm Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just following up on Manav’s margin questionnaire for a little bit, maybe this is nitpicking, but if I look at two of the segments, Commodity Insights and Mobility you did basically leave your adjusted revenue growth and forecast unchanged from the prior guidance, but the margins are actually now lower. So with everything you just changed as I said, it does seem like some costs are higher. So maybe you can flush it out specifically to those two segments because not sure why the margins would be lower if the revenues unchanged. Ewout Steenbergen Alex these are really small changes and movements on the revenue line and with respect to the expense line for those two segments, which could drive that, for example, you're just staying within the range on revenues, but just having a slight adjustment with respect to the expected margins for that segment. So let me take as an example Commodity Insights, as we have highlighted, this is the segment where we have some impact of the Russian situation, but then that is offset by very positive momentum commercially in the Commodity Insights businesses. So we can offset a part of it. And as a result, you see a little bit of impact on revenue and margins and that is being reflected in those changes. But overall, I wouldn't read too much into it. These are just really minor impacts that we are seeing on those businesses. Alex Kramm Okay. Helpful. Thank you. And then just second just on the Market Intelligence side, hoping that you can give us a little bit more color around the commercial success you're having so far, what I'm asking specifically is I've had some client conversations and it sounds like for at least for some clients, you're not really integrating the sales force, yes. And they are operating basically at two organizations until next year. So I don't know if those are one-offs or this representative of the whole book of business, but I would've expect with all the planning that basically you're going to be operating at as one company. And so maybe just flush out what's been done and why maybe we're hearing that it's not fully integrated quite yet? Doug Peterson Yeah. Alex, thanks for that. And we're actually fully integrated. Market Intelligence is the division that's absolutely the furthest ahead on that. We have done full training of all of the products across the two divisions. We have seen the ability to now go out with joint planning for all customers across the financial services and the Market Intelligence to prior segments. We have a lot of early wins both with clients as well as with products, a couple of examples, some of the early wins have come by moving more and more data sets from financial services into what we talked about earlier on the call to marketplace. We've also seen some early wins on selling products, which would've been traditionally financial service products into the corporate client base of Market Intelligence. And then we have some new products which have also been launched. We talked about one of them, the PVR which is responsive to some new SEC rules, which are coming out later this year. So that must be anecdotal. I'm not sure you were speaking with, but we are really excited about the integration and the speed that we're able to develop a cross-sell. We mentioned that we have over 2,000 cross-sell ideas and leads, and we're following up on those very, very quickly. And as you saw, we're also ahead of our prior assumptions about how we'd be doing with synergy. So this is one of the areas that I think we're actually doing the best on. Alex Kramm Okay. Very good. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks Alex. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Toni Kaplan Perfect, thanks. Wanted to ask another one on synergies. It looks like you're making really great progress on the cost side, on the revenue side. It makes sense that it'll take a longer time just given the need to create new products. But I guess, are you aware you thought you'd be on the revenue synergy side or is it taking longer and do you still feel good about the 2024 target there? Doug Peterson Yeah. Thanks Toni. Well, I feel actually really positive about the projections that we have on the revenue synergies. It's something that we've always known that would take a while to understand the customers, to be able to integrate data sets to have a fully integrated sales force. But to have the ability to already be running it at $15 million run rate which we announced this quarter for me is ahead of what we would've thought we would've been. We still haven't changed the view that a lot of the revenue synergies will be more back-ended in the next two to three years. But the early projections in the early progress is excellent. Toni Kaplan That sounds great. And then just on Market Intelligence, the Enterprise Solutions piece only up 2% year-over-year, just want to clarify, is this the legacy IHS Solutions business? I think it used to be comprised of enterprise software and managed services. I just – I wasn't as familiar, I guess, with the volume based offerings that are in there, which is driving maybe the slow down, just any additional color on that thing? Doug Peterson Yeah. Thanks Toni. Yeah, you're right about, what's comprised of that solutions group. It includes IPO as well. But there's a portion of the revenues in that business which come from IPOs and as you know, the IPO market has been incredibly weak. So that's the main issue which has seen slowed down of growth, but the underlying business is doing quite well. We're delivering software, we're delivering solutions. This is one of the areas where we've seen some of the early wins on being able to position products, which traditionally have been sold to financial services into the corporate sector. So off to a great start, but having some impact from the very, very weak capital markets in IPO positioning. Toni Kaplan Makes sense. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks Toni. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. You may go ahead. Hamzah Mazari Hey, good morning. My question is on the non-transactional side of the ratings business, maybe you could just comment on how stable is that business through the cycle and what are your sort of assumptions there for the balance of the year? Doug Peterson Good morning Hamzah, of course I will give you some further insights on that. As you know non-transaction revenues is a bucket of different elements and they are not all pointing in the same direction. So let me give you a little bit further insight in what we're expecting here. So what is looking strong is annual fees as well as CRISIL. So we would expect those to continue to do well for the remainder of the year, in-line of what you have seen for the second quarter. And that will be offset by some impact of FX, ratings evaluation services, which is more linked to M&amp;A and initial credit ratings, which is also down. So I think best to expect a low single digit decline for non-transaction revenue this year, but that is of course in the bigger scheme for ratings providing some offset and stability for the transaction revenue declines. Hamzah Mazari Got it. Very helpful. And just my follow-up is just on the Indices side of the business, I think the SEC was looking at whether Indices businesses should be treated as investment advisors versus data publishers. Is there anything, I guess on the regulatory front on the Indices side that you are looking at or that investors should be cracking or is this just not really material? Thank you. Doug Peterson Yeah. Hamzah, as you know our business has already run as if we're regulated and we are regulated in some jurisdictions like the European jurisdiction under what's called the BMR. The SEC has a request for comment out about – for about index providers. We will file a response. As you know, there's a long term trend from active to passive. It's an industry that has very low cost independence, a lot of transparency. We have a very strong performance over the last 65 years, and we'll obviously highlight all of that in our response to the SEC. But as of now, this is just a request for comment. There's nothing related to it. That is any regulatory proposals. And we were not surprised given the size of the growth of the index industry. Hamzah Mazari Got it. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks Hamzah. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Jeff Silber Thanks so much. In looking at Slide 23 where you have your economic assumptions, you’re forecasting obviously slower growth in real GDP, but not really forecasting a recession. We can argue what the definition of a recession is later. But let me play devil’s advocate. Let’s assume that the U.S. more importantly the global economy might be going into a recession in the second half of this year. What would be the impact on your different business segments? Doug Peterson Let me start, and then I’m going to hand it over to Ewout to give you some more color. But first of all, we have the assumptions that you saw on Slide 23. We have seen a significant slowdown in growth in the United States, the Eurozone and globally, and China being one of those markets, which is also seemed substantial slowdown given their current policies. This has also been matched with a higher inflation. Each of our businesses have different types of impact in this scenario with the ratings business you’ve already seen is being directly impacted already by the increase in inflation, by the weak issuance environment, by the uncertainty in the markets. If you looked at our commodity insight business, we could see some growth in the volatility from the higher cost of oil, which you saw here, we have a projected that the crude price will be at $106 and a range that’s much higher than it had been in the prior years. That leads to some increase in interest in trading information for risk information and then the overall energy industry does quite well in that positioning. So we could see some benefits from that. Our other businesses market intelligence should see some benefits from people interested in information and data about the risk environment, but at the same time, if we – if our customers start going under stress, we might have to think about how we negotiate with them to accompany them in their – in if they have difficult times. I’m going to hand it over to Ewout to mention a little bit more about indices impact as well as the other businesses. Ewout Steenbergen Jeff of course, immediately thinking at the more market sensitive businesses, ratings transaction revenue, the AUM fees in the index business, but offset by of course a higher ETD volumes. And as Doug mentioned before, the capital markets platform business in the enterprise solutions part of market intelligence, but the offset is that we are seeing other parts of the businesses doing well when we have higher volatility for example global trading services and commodity insight just to mention one area. On top of it, we are then having the opportunity to take further actions. You could say to some extent, we’re already executing on our downturn playbook at this moment and taking those actions for the second half of this year, and that is to protect our margins. And we can of course pull those levers even harder. I would like to point out that actually the merger gives us a very good basis and a strong benefit to deal with a more uncertain environment and future. The resiliency of the business, the higher level of recurring revenues that we are having, the diversification benefit and then also of course, all the synergies that we can achieve. And those gives us levers in terms of offsetting an environment that we think is a clear benefit and is a differentiator for us compared to many others. Jeff Silber Okay. That’s really helpful. If I could shift back to the ratings business, we saw a pretty large bond sale yesterday from Apple. I don’t know if there were a frequent issue or not. I don’t know if you were involved, if that’ll impact your transactional revenues, but more importantly, they seem to be a pretty good timer over the market. Do you think that might be a bellwether that we’ll see other companies come to market that we might not have expected a few weeks ago? Doug Peterson Yes. Jeff, we’ve actually seen pretty strong issuance from the investment grade sector. A lot of those large issuers, especially financial institutions tend to be on frequent issuer programs, where we really see the biggest impact on the downdraft of issuances in the non-investment grade, the high yield sector, you’re looking at the B, CCC, BB sectors. So there’s been very low formation of CLOs. In fact, we’ve seen the retail sector have withdrawals from risk positions and so we’ve seen a decrease in funding for CLOs. So there – the real part of the issuance curve, which we’re not seeing any life at all is really the high yield sector. But on the on the investment grade, there has been a lot of activity, we’ve seen in particular financial institutions very active, and then people like Apple, you’ve seen there, but the real story, we need to look deeper across all of the different segments. And it’s the high yield sector both for loans and bonds that we’ve seen the biggest weakness. Jeff Silber Okay. Really helpful. Thanks so much. Doug Peterson Thanks, Jeff. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Faiza Alwy Yes. Hi, thank you, and good morning. I was hoping to follow-up on revenue synergies. And curious if you could give us some examples of areas where you’re seeing the most traction at this point. Doug Peterson Yes. So first of all, we’re – as I said earlier, we’re really excited that we’re off to such a fast start on the cross-sell. And so the initial opportunities have are on cross-sell and the two biggest areas we’ve seen the growth is in the market intelligence business, it’s been with the sales of what had traditionally been financial services products for example, products which are used for Investor Relations teams and finding the corporate segment, which market intelligence had a lot of penetration with being able to open that door and bring those types of products to the corporate sector. In the commodity insights world, we see a lot of opportunities for data and research products, which were coming from the ENR side from IHS Markit that are now being marketed to the traditional plats clients that were benchmark clients. And so we’ve seen a lot of upside there. A third area would be within the index business. As you know, we brought the IHS Markit’s fixed income index business over, and there’s a lot of opportunities. These are not necessarily in our run rate yet, but they’re in our pipeline related to ESG Indices that will be on fixed income indices. So that’s a big theme that we haven’t seen necessarily the revenue coming in yet, but a lot of interest in that, but those would be the three largest areas so far. Faiza Alwy Great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on the rating side of the business, you were just talking about high yield. And I’m curious as we look at your refinancing study, assuming the volatility eases as we get into 2023. And I know you said you won’t comment on 2023, but I just wanted to get just a holistic view around how you think about the high yield market normalizing from here. Doug Peterson Yes. The high yield market we look at in a few ways, one of them is obviously there’s a large amount of firepower of capital that’s available for the private equity in the sponsor industry. We estimate that that’s well north of $1 trillion somewhere around $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion of capital be deployed. We also look at the M&amp;A pipeline, the M&amp;A pipeline right now there’s a lot of deals to be completed, but they’re actually taking a lot of time. So there’s a slow realization of M&amp;A, which has already been announced, but not completed. So that’s another one of the levers we look at quite closely. And then there’s going to be a refinancing requirement, they’ll be start coming in over, which relates to 2023, 2024, 2025. Traditionally, we’ve seen some of that pull forward into earlier times as people look at how the interest rate market is playing out what their growth prospects are, et cetera, but those would be the key factors we’re looking at the what’s happening with rates, what’s happening with the private equity industry, with M&amp;A, with refinancing. And then just generally speaking, as you know, I mentioned earlier to one of the other answers, there’s kind of a risk off approach, especially from the retail and the wealth management sectors. They have not been participating in the formation of new CLOs. And in fact, have been withdrawing their liquidity from the high yield products. So we think that we will start seeing people go back into that when there’s some more uncertainty and stability in the markets as well. Faiza Alwy Great. Thank you so much. Doug Peterson Thanks, Faiza. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. You may go ahead. Trevor Romeo Hi, good morning. This is actually Trevor Romeo on for Andrew. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Just two quick ones for me. First of all, the ESG revenue growth of 66% in a quarter, it’s encouraging to see that accelerate kind of even further. Just wondering if there’s anything in the current environment that’s kind of boosting that ESG growth above trend or if there’s kind of any evidence that even higher growth rates might be sustainable over a longer period of time. Doug Peterson Yes. Good morning. So let me give you a little bit more color on the ESG growth, which is of course phenomenal and we’re very happy because we have been guiding to a 46% CAGR for a multi-year period and to be coming in at this kind of a level of growth of 66% is of course really great. So a couple of underlying elements, we’re seeing nice growth in commodity insights that’s written by clean energy technology, energy transition activities, as well as new price assessments around ESG. Also market intelligence doing well, particularly around climate and the true cost offerings and the ESG data sales. If we look at the Indices business, we have been investing a lot in new ESG Indices, and that is also clearly starting to payoff. And then in ratings, although coming from a small base, we see some positive momentum in second party or opinion, so good momentum. We’re clearly investing in it. There’s a lot of market demands and we would expect that positive momentum in ESG to continue. Trevor Romeo That’s great. Thanks. And then maybe a somewhat related follow-up. The Inflation Reduction Act that’s been proposed out there has pretty significant climate investments and tax credits for the clean energy industry. So would you see something like that if it actually were to get past kind of having any demand on either the commodity insights business or the ESG business? Thanks. Doug Peterson It’s something that’s still obviously in discussion in Washington. Generally speaking, infrastructure bills something like this, which is going to be geared towards the climate sector could see some benefit as it – as the financing gets into the market, but this could take a while before we really start seeing it layer into the market. Trevor Romeo Okay. Understood. Thank you very much. Doug Peterson Thanks, Trevor. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. You may go ahead. Craig Huber Great. Thank you. My first question, on commodity insights, curious in the second quarter, what percent of the revenues there were fossil fuel based about by the end customer? And then along the same lines there, when are you guys expecting peak oil use globally? Then I have a follow-up Doug Peterson On the first question about the fossil fuel based, I don’t have the answer. We’ll have to get back to you on that. But just remember that across the business, a large part of our complex relates to – it relates to energy. But in addition, we’ve seen some great opportunities to increase our knowledge across the group. As an example, we issued a special study on copper, which even though copper isn’t a fossil fuel, copper is going to be necessary component for the energy transition. So we’ll have to get back to you to the answer on the fossil fuel question. Craig Huber And then also can you talk a little bit about the your market intelligence area that the health of the – of your customers there right now given the market volatility. What’s the sales pipeline looking like? Just talk about that, please. Thank you. Doug Peterson Yes. The commodity insights business actually despite knowing that the price of oil is quite high is a healthy pipeline right now. There’s a lot of demand for information. As I mentioned, the special copper study we’ve done, we have been deploying a whole new set of energy transition products. So even if there’s been some concern, some of the traditional areas of some of the consumers of oil and gas might have a little bit more stress. The overall market is still very robust with the energy industry itself in a strong position, the commodity industries are looking for a lot new insights, information and data. And then we’re being able to find new opportunities to mix and match our data across the entire company. As an example, we’ve launched some new indices through the index business, which relate to commodities data. So we’re finding a lot of opportunities across the company to mix and match products. We see a strong growth pipeline. Craig Huber Great. Thanks, Doug. Doug Peterson Thanks. Thanks, Craig. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. Owen Lau Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Could you please give us an update on your ability to pass through some of the inflationary cost to your customers through with pricing in each segment. Thank you. Doug Peterson Hello, Owen, and let me give you some further insights on that. So when we think about pricing, we always first start to think about the value we generate for our customers. So that’s the starting point. And as you know, our products are very valuable. They’re important, particularly in an current environment with high volatility, lot of economic uncertainty, our research, our datasets, our insights, all the consumption of it is even higher in the current period of times. And then we also know our base products itself are very valuable for our customers. So that is always the starting point before we start to think about pricing. Obviously in an high inflationary environment, it’s fair to consider passing on a part of our cost price increases to our customers, if that is appropriate and balanced in relation to what I said before. And we’re doing that selectively. So think about custom and data subscriptions in index, there we have made some changes and also we have made a list price change in the ratings business now starting on August 1. So a mid-year change also for the ratings fees. So those are a couple of examples, but always in the context of finding the right balance for the company and thinking about the health of the company, the retention levels and the interest of our customers from a medium and long-term perspective. Owen Lau Got it. That’s helpful. And then on the dealer revenue in your Mobility segment, I think it was quite strong up 10% year-over-year. Could you please talk about maybe the drive of that strength from CARFAX and also the sustainability of this growth? And then more broadly, could you please also talk about the retention rate of the Mobility business? Thank you. Doug Peterson Yeah. Thanks, Owen. This is a business that is benefiting tremendously from all of the disruption in the supply chain and the automotive manufacturing sector. The dealers right now are really in a high need for information about the used car sector, which is where the most movement is going. They’re working very closely with the manufacturers and the OEMs on programs about providing discounts, providing incentives for new car sales. So the dealers right now are in the middle of a very high demand low product environment. And so CARFAX has been benefiting across the board. So all the CARFAX businesses, as well as Automotive Mastermind, there were a couple of new products that were launched. One that’s called – it’s called an EyeQ, spelled E-Y-E-Q product, which provides a balance between the manufacturing and the dealer segment to look at how incentives and discounts are provided. So this is an area where CARFAX has been tremendously benefited by this difficult environment. And it’s really the dealers that have the highest demand. Owen Lau Got it. Thank you very much. Doug Peterson Yes. Thanks Owen. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. You may go ahead. Jeff Meuler Yes. Thank you. I see that you have your third straight quarter of upstream data ACV growth adjusted for Russia-Ukraine. I guess my question, is it continuing to accelerate or can you just give us any sense of the order of the magnitude of the growth in that business, given obviously revenue is lagging. Ewout Steenbergen Jeff, in fact, this is the third consecutive quarter that we’re seeing ACV growth in the upstream business. Of course, a bit impacted by the Russia situation. So think about it more in the revenue growth of around 3.5%, if you exclude that Russia impact for the quarter itself for revenues in the upstream business. So I would call this a turnaround. This is a business that had a very difficult period for the last few years, but coming out of it in a very strong way, clearly, the overall situation in the energy markets are helping this business. The levels of CapEx that are going into this industry are going up. So very positive momentum and we would expect that also to continue in the near future. Jeff Meuler Okay. And then Ewout, I get that you’re saying the adjustments in terms of segment margin guidance are small. I get that, I guess, are the adjustments driven by the pricing or the inflationary pressure that you’re seeing. Or is there also some reallocation of corporate cost, because of the lower revenue outlook in the rating segment that get absorbed into those other segments? Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen No changes with respect to financial reporting allocations and so on, actually allocations are coming down, because of the synergies, of course, also helped by the management actions that we highlighted. So what you are seeing is actually a really a very mix shift of reasons what is happening in the different businesses. So I was speaking about the assumptions, for example, in the Index business, with respect to the AUM level, staying flat in our assumption for the second half of the year, the impact of Russia in Commodity Insights offset by strong commercial momentum. So a very different set of reasons for each of the segments. But I think overall, these impacts are relatively small. I think the main area, of course, that you are seeing is the impact of the outlook for ratings, where we are not assuming any improvements in the issuance environment for the second half of the year compared to what we’ve seen in the more recent past. But five of our six divisions from our perspective, performing very well, quite resilient are seeing good, healthy revenue growth and strong margin expansion. And we think margin expansion in this environment is actually a really positive that we can deliver to our shareholders. Jeff Meuler Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. George Tong Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to your issuance outlook. You’re forecasting a 30% to 45% decline in build issuance for this year. Can you clarify if your updated guidance assumes that issuance trends will mirror performance we’ve seen in June and July? Or if you’re assuming issuance over the remaining five months will be similar to the first seven months of the year effectively calling up bottoming in issuance performance year-to-date. Doug Peterson Yes. George, the second half of the year’s assumption is that it’s similar to June and July. If you actually look at any year, the second half of the year is always has lower level of issuance in the first half of the year. If you think about it, you’ve got the summer months in there, you’ve got July and August, which are always quite slow. And then you’ve got some holidays towards the end of the year in the U.S. market, which are also quite slow. So we’re expecting that there will be the issuance level will be similar to what it’s been the last couple months. George Tong Okay. And is that on an absolute dollar basis of issuance or is that seasonally adjusted looking at year-over-year growth trends? Doug Peterson Both. George Tong Okay. Got it. And then a as a follow-up, maybe going back to Commodity Insights, you’re calling for mid-single-digit growth and that outlook was unchanged from your prior outlook. You mentioned Russia, of course, being a headwind, but can you talk about other moving pieces in the business? I would’ve expect Commodity Insights potentially to benefit more from some of the commodity prices we’ve seen. Ewout Steenbergen George. So if we look at the underlying components and the sales activity, we’re actually seeing record sales levels of the last few quarters for Commodity Insights, clearly highlighting the benefit of the combined business. We are now having the benefit are the commodity prices today net-net, that’s a good situation for our customers. The benefit we are seeing from some of the revenue synergies, although, it’s early and the numbers are low that is clearly benefit. And then of course, on top of that, also the focus on energy transition, which leads to additional investments. And we have of course, an incredible level of expertise around that, that we can help our customers. So across the Board, in each of the categories, if it is advisory and transactional, if it is upstream, price assessments and the resource data and insights, I think all of that is looking very positive. Yes, there is a little bit of the impact of Russia 10 months of impact this year, because that impact started more or less in March. Then you will see a little bit of impact for two months next year, then we will be lapping that and then I think all the underlying drivers of positive momentum will continue. George Tong Got it. Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks George. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. You may go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum Hi, thank you. I cut out a little bit, and so I’m not sure if you addressed this in prior discussions. But in the Mobility segment, dealing with very strong demand in CARFAX because of used cars in the like. If you would see – if we start to see some improvement in supply chain over the next year or so, do you expect that we’re going to see a little bit of a balancing out in some of the other areas we’ll do better? Or do you expect that we’re going to start to see just not seeing the same kind of growth that we saw beforehand in terms of CARFAX. Doug Peterson Yes. Thanks, Shlomo. We think that this Mobility segment has a many – has a very high growth trajectory ahead of it. If you look at a couple of different factors, one that I described earlier relates to the used car environment, where right now there’s very low production of new automobiles, which is taking place, which means that there is a need for dealers to have product. They don’t have product right now. So when they get it, they can sell it, they can sell it at premium. They need the data in the analytics, whether it’s from Automotive Mastermind or it’s the CARFAX product. So there’s a high demand right now for that. And the dealer’s approach to working with customers is not going to go away even as the global production starts coming back. And there’s going to be a revolution taking place in the transmission system such will move toward electric vehicles. So the dealer approach is going to stay quite important. We think the manufacturing approach could actually benefit from much higher growth of production. You see that we think that the global production will start continuing to increase over the next few years going up – even up to 9% in 2023 in the Slide that we produced. There’s another area which we think has some opportunities for growth, which is financials. And we’ve been producing some new products for the financial sector. We talked about one of them earlier, which is some credit information for the insurance industry, as well as the financial services industry on the automotive sector. So across the board, we think this is a segment, which is going through a lot of change. There’s a lot of disruption taking place and it’s an opportunity for us to be at the middle of that to provide the data and the insights and analytics, the dealers and audit manufacturers and financial institutions need to make informed decisions. Shlomo Rosenbaum Okay, great. And then, Ewout, this is just maybe a housekeeping one. But what was the ending share count? Not the average share count in the quarter, but kind of the ending share count. And should we expect that to be very different next quarter in terms of kind of finishing up the ASRs. Just trying to figure out, make sure we’re – at least our modeling the share count appropriately. Ewout Steenbergen Shlomo, we put a specific slide in the appendix to help you with your question and where you can see the decline of the overall share count over the period of this year. So we started with 360 – sorry, 356 million of combined shares after the issuance of shares for the IHS Markit shareholders. That has come down to 339 million most recently. We expect about 5 million of shares to be delivered as a true up for the $8.5 billion ASR that will be ended soon. Then we will enter into the new $2.5 billion ASR, the upfront delivery of that would be something like 6 million of share, so somewhere later this month, we all have those also taken out. So you could say about 25% of the shares that were issued for the IHS Markit have already been removed in a period of six months, which we think is phenomenal. And then of course, we get the true up of the new ASR of $2.5 billion and shares that will be delivered for the 1 million at the end of the year. So that is the decline, but more details you can find in the appendix of the slide to help you and all your colleagues with the mobile link. Shlomo Rosenbaum Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Shlomo. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Andrew Steinerman Hi. I just wanted to go back to Slide 31 Market Intelligence, where desktop, which is where I want to focus was up 6%. And you did mention strong new sales and renewals. I know this is an area where you’re adding content and data to Cap IQ Pro, I just wanted to know how much of this is kind of market driven versus your kind of product upgrade driven. And do you expect momentum in your desktop business in the second half of the year? Doug Peterson Good morning, Andrew. We are very pleased with the trends we’re seeing with respect to desktop, very stable business, growing in a steady way. We see good commercial momentum. We see good user satisfaction levels, and that is translating in high retention, nice growth of annualized contract value, pickup of price increases based on the enterprise approach we are doing with respect to our contracts. And then also [indiscernible] of the products is going up. Satisfaction level also better think about page loads that are going much faster than we had in the past. So overall, we like what we are seeing in desktop growing nicely steadily and good commercial momentum and great customer satisfaction around it. Andrew Steinerman Thank you. Appreciate it. Doug Peterson Thanks Andrew. Operator Thank you. We will take our final question from Russell Quelch with Redburn. You may go ahead. Russell Quelch Yes. Thank you for having me and appreciate it. To be on the current catch up buyback, can you just lay out your priorities for use of excess capital? Should we be expecting our phones in the second half of this year? And if we should, perhaps, what areas do you believe you are light in terms of data and product suite? Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen So I would say this in the following way and by the way, thank you for joining the call and thank you for initiating your coverage on S&amp;P Global. We are looking at continued return of capital. We have our specific targets with respect to our capital management philosophies, and we will continue to execute on that. We’re very happy that we will continue with the 12 billion share buyback, despite lowering our adjusted free cash flow for the full year. We have sufficient ability to complete to 12 billion, and then we’ll continue with returning capital to our shareholders next year with the at least 85% of free cash flow. We have no plans with respect to large M&amp;A at this moment, maybe some small tuck-in and bolt-ons where we can find some nice additions to our propositions. Think about ESG, but otherwise no changes with respect to the plans, the philosophy and the targets will continue on the path that you’re used to see from us. Russell Quelch Thanks, Ewout. I’ll leave it there. Thanks for your comments. Doug Peterson Thanks, Russell. Well, as we close the call, I want to thank everyone again for joining it for your questions and for your support. As I said at the beginning of the call, it’s incredible to see that within just five months, how much stronger and resilient we are as a new company with S&amp;P Global and IHS Markit. We have a very robust integration management office in place, we call it the IMO. We’re partnering with all of the businesses together with a new management team to create value and to ensure that we can create this unified vision to deliver S&amp;P Global. None of the progress would be possible without the commitment and really hard work of our people. They’ve done a fantastic job and I do want to thank them again for their effort as they’ve been working for over 1.5 years, two years to get ready for this deal. And now the last five months to really make sure it’s moving along. I’m really pleased that all of us have come together to do such a great job so far, and we want to continue to deliver. I hope that everyone has an enjoyable summer and want to thank everybody for joining the call today. Thank you very much. Operator That concludes this morning’s call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in about two hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&amp;P Global’s website for one year. The audio-only telephone replay will be maintained for one month.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug? Doug Peterson Thank you, Mark. Welcome to today’s first quarter earnings call. I\\'d like to start by highlighting the historic event that occurred in the first quarter of 2022. We completed our merger with IHS Markit. And I\\'m incredibly excited to be joining you for our first quarterly earnings call as a combined company. The promise of the merger has already begun to manifest itself in our culture and our financial performance. Beginning with a few financial highlights. We reported strong financial results with adjusted pro forma revenue increasing 2% and adjusted pro forma diluted EPS increasing $0.01 year-over-year despite one of the most challenging issuance environments in recent history. We saw positive revenue growth in five of our six divisions, including double-digit growth in three of them. Adjusted pro forma expenses increased 8% as we continue to invest in events, people and technology. Though much of this expense growth is non-recurring as we\\'ll discuss later on. We\\'re updating our guidance to reflect the increased uncertainty caused by the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape. And Ewout will walk through these details in a moment. I\\'d also like to share a few highlights from the first quarter. As I mentioned, we completed the merger with IHS Markit, had a number of exciting achievements. We announced a $12 billion accelerated share repurchase or ASR and launched the first tranche of $7 billion dollars in March with the remainder to be executed by the end of the year. We took advantage of this still historically low interest rate environment to optimize our capital structure and lower our average cost of debt. And we had strong attendance at some of the industry\\'s most important conferences, including CERAWeek, World Petrochemical Conference and TPM22. While we\\'ve only been together for 2 months, we\\'re already starting to see validation of our investment thesis, and the results of our comprehensive planning are paying off. We\\'ve begun leveraging technology like Kensho across the broader organization to automate processes to increase efficiencies. We\\'ve begun development of several new products and features across the divisions. We\\'re integrating our divisional commercial teams, and we\\'ve already closed synergy deals in multiple divisions. I want to take a moment to touch on culture and leadership. We brought our combined leadership team together in person for the first time in March. We were thrilled to see so many of our colleagues brainstorming, planning, working and functioning as if they had already been together for years. We saw the free exchange of ideas, strong proposals for new growth engines, and clear alignment on our strategy, purpose and values. We also heard a unified voice among our leadership in support of our people first initiatives and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. We came away energized and full of confidence that we\\'ll be able to take the absolute best not only from each company, but from each person in the organization and create something exceptional with S&amp;P Global. I have never been more inspired by our people, and I\\'m more excited than ever to work with them to drive sustainable, profitable growth. When we announced the merger in November 2020, we noted that we needed regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions. We received final regulatory approval on February 25, 2022, and officially closed the merger 3 days later on February 28. We immediately went to work optimizing the capital structure issuing $5.5 billion in new debt, most of which was used to refinance existing debt at lower rates. We completed that refinancing in April 2022. In order to secure regulatory approval for the merger, we will require to divest a number of businesses. The table on this slide lays out the details of those divestitures. As we have shared with you before, the aggregate revenue from all of the businesses being divested is approximately $425 million. And the margins for each of these businesses are higher than the margins for each of the divisions they were in. We\\'re confident that we negotiated well on behalf of our shareholders in these transactions, evidenced by approximately 9.5x revenue multiple paid by the acquirers of these businesses in aggregate. Net after tax proceeds will total $2.85 billion. Now to recap, the financial results for the first quarter. Revenue increased 2% to $3.1 billion. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 6% to $1.4 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 340 basis points to 45% as both profits and margin were negatively impacted by the decrease in ratings transaction revenue and expense growth I mentioned earlier. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which decreased 60 basis points to 47%. In addition to our strong overall revenue performance and continued expense management, we launched a $7 billion ASR and began optimizing our capital structure. Combined with tax effects of merger related synergies and prudent investment, we increased adjusted pro forma diluted EPS year-over-year. Looking across the six divisions, I\\'m encouraged by the fact that even in a challenging macroeconomic environment, we were able to deliver strong revenue across five of our six divisions, including double-digit growth in Commodity Insights, Mobility and Indices. In line with the expectations we laid out on our call in March, we did see a year-over-year decrease in ratings driven by an exceptionally soft issuance environment. During the first quarter, global bond issuance decreased 12%. This understates the impact to our business, however, as high yield issuance declined far more dramatically. In the U.S., issuance in aggregate decreased 25%. Its investment grade decreased 19%, high yield decreased 75%, public finance decreased 15%, structured finance increased 9% due to large increases in mortgage-backed securities offset by declines in structured credit. Bank loan ratings declined 35% year-over-year. European issuance decreased 14% as investment grade decreased 11%, high yield decreased 54% and structured finance increased 27% due to increases in RMBS and covered bonds, partially offset by declines in ABS, CMBS and structured credit. In Asia, issuance was flat. The next two slides look at the difference we saw in the quarter between investment grade issuance, and the issuance of high yield and leveraged loans. This slide shows an investment grade issuances resilient relative to other categories, decreasing only 5% year-over-year. This slide depicts the combination of high yield issuance in leveraged loan volume. This quarter we saw a decrease of over 50% from the incredible levels in the year ago period. High yield was particularly impacted by the uncertainty in the market, with issuance decreasing 68% year-over-year. While difficult to pinpoint exact causes, issuance in the first quarter was impacted both by the pull-forward we witnessed and discussed last year as well as the intentional delay we\\'re hearing from customers, as many issuers wait for clear signs of stability before re-entering the market. Now turning to some of the factors that made this quarter successful for S&amp;P Global. We saw significant increases in engagement and usage of our products and our content this quarter. The metrics on this slide are clear evidence that in periods of increased uncertainty, whether that\\'s in the macroeconomic picture, market volatility or geopolitical tensions, our customers turn to us. They turn to us for the insights, data and tools that they need to make well informed business and investment decisions. It\\'s also important to remember that S&amp;P Global\\'s stronger more diverse product portfolio allows areas of the business to thrive in times of elevated volatility and uncertainty. Within the S&amp;P Dow Jones indices business, we saw more than 20% growth in revenue from our exchange-traded derivatives, whose volumes are directly correlated with market volatility. In the commodities markets, our global trading services business within Commodity Insights grew 17% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we held a number of Premier conferences attracting thousands of leaders from multiple industries. Several of these conferences returned to being in-person events for the first time in 3 years. One of these was CERAWeek. For some S&amp;P Global Investors CERAWeek may be unfamiliar. CERAWeek is the world\\'s leading event for the energy industry taking place in the first quarter each year and hosted in Houston, Texas. We were thrilled to welcome attendees back in-person. And it\\'s clear that all of the factors impacting the energy industry right now, industry and government leaders wanted to be there. We had record attendance with over 5,200 delegates, 900 speakers and 50 senior government officials. With the combined resources, S&amp;P Global Platts and IHS Markit, we\\'re confident that CERAWeek will continue to grow and set itself apart as the must attend event for energy industry leaders. We also hosted the annual World Petrochemical Conference and the TPM Conference in the first quarter. Both conferences aimed to help industry leaders navigate some of the most pressing challenges facing our global economy. WPC convened this year to discuss how the chemical industry can help facilitate and thrive in a world progressing towards more sustainable operations, including net zero emissions targets. Our conferences bring people together to drive innovation and growth in different industries. But they also demonstrate the strength of S&amp;P Global as a source and a destination for global leadership. We\\'re thrilled with the progress we\\'ve made as we celebrate the first anniversary of Sustainable1. ESG revenue growth accelerate on both reported and organic basis in the first quarter, growing 57% year-over-year to reach nearly $50 million. We continue to introduce new ESG-related products and product enhancements at a rapid pace. In the first quarter, we saw the launch of 17 ESG ETFs based on our indices, and we ended the first quarter with AUM in ESG ETFs growing 28% to surpass $33 billion. Our Indices and Commodity Insights teams collaborated to launch the S&amp;P GSCI Electric Vehicle Metals Index, and we continue to enhance ESG scores made available through our Capital IQ pro platform. One of the greatest advantages we have in ESG is the robust set of data that comes to us through the active participation of covered companies. Our 2021 corporate sustainability assessment saw a 64% increase in the number of companies working with us directly to ensure the datasets behind our ESG scores are robust, accurate and comprehensive. Our coverage of more than 11,000 companies includes approximately 2,300, which provide datasets and disclosure directly to CSA. Our commitment to active partnership with covered companies ensures our ESG scores are informed by the best data available. Now turning to our outlook. We have updated our bond issuance forecast for the year to reflect a decrease in the first quarter, as well as to better reflect the ongoing impact of macroeconomic uncertainty and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We now expect global issuance to decline approximately 5% year-over-year within a range of down 14% to flat in 2022. We expect corporates to see a 12% decrease in issuance partially offset by a 2% increase in financial services issuance. We expect U.S public finance and structured finance to each soften by 7%, and international public finance to shrink by about 1.5%. As we evaluate the remainder of the year, we wanted to discuss some of the assumptions that underpin our guidance. Let me start with our response to the tragic events taking place in Ukraine, and the impact on our business. As we\\'ve shared with you previously, combined revenue from Russia and Belarus is less than 1% of our total revenue. We have suspended commercial operations in Russia and Belarus including all customer contracts. We\\'ve suspended ratings of Russian entities and removed stocks and bonds listed or domiciled in Russia from our indices. While the direct financial impact on our business is not material, we acknowledged the indirect impact on the issuance environment and market volatility. We also wanted to illustrate some of the changes in the macroeconomic environment and inform our financial outlook for the company. In addition to lower debt issuance, we now expect slightly lower global GDP growth. Inflation is also likely to have a greater impact on our business and the economy as a whole relative to our expectations earlier this year. We\\'re seeing some upward pressure on compensation expense that we expect to continue throughout the rest of the year. Commodities prices remain elevated relative to our early expectations as well. To be clear, this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all metrics that inform our outlook, but rather to help investors understand the changes in some of the assumptions we make about the global economy when formulating guidance. Before handing it over to Ewout. I\\'d like to reiterate how pleased we are with the execution success we\\'ve seen in a challenging quarter. Our ability to drive positive growth in both revenue and adjusted pro forma earnings per share in a quarter like this would have been much more challenging before a merger with IHS Markit. The strength, stability and scale of our businesses gives us great confidence to invest for future growth and be optimistic about the years ahead. We remain committed to our strategic organic investments, as illustrated on this slide. And we remain confident these investments will power significant future growth and profitability for the company. With that I\\'ll turn it over to Ewout to walk through our results and guidance. Ewout? Ewout Steenbergen Thank you, Doug. I want to start by emphasizing the successful execution we saw this quarter. With five of our six divisions posting pro forma revenue growth, it\\'s already clear that we are more resilient, both operationally and financially as a combined company. With our larger scale and more diversified revenue streams, we\\'re more insulated to volatility in the debt issuance market. As such, we were able to grow pro forma revenue and adjusted EPS year-over-year even during a period of sharp decreases in issuance. Doug highlighted the headline financial results. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. But as a reminder, when we discuss financial results from operations and cash flows, we\\'re discussing those results on an adjusted pro forma basis, as if S&amp;P Global and IHS Markit were combined for the entirety of all periods presented, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from divested businesses in all periods. We have also made minor refinements to the recast pro forma financials for all four quarters of 2021, which can be found in the amended 8-K filed today. Adjusted corporate and allocated expenses declined from a year ago, caused by a combination of reduced incentive and fringe costs, as well as the release of certain benefits accruals. Our net interest expense increased 5% as we increase gross debt partially offset the lower average rates due to refinancings. The decrease in adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to tax deductions related to stock-based compensation and merger related optimization of capital and liquidity structure. As we introduced last year, we\\'ll continue to disclose these three categories of non-GAAP adjustments to provide insights into the type of expenses that we are incurring related to the merger and the synergies we have discussed. Transaction costs in the quarter were $281 million. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees. Integration cost in the quarter were $58 million. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure, and retention cost. Costs to achieve synergies amounted to $88 million in the quarter. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease termination, severance, contract exit fees, and investments related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements. During the first quarter, the non-GAAP operating adjustments collectively totaled to $504 million, including a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of businesses and a $200 million contribution to the S&amp;P Global Foundation in addition to the merger related items I mentioned. Given the growth in expenses this quarter, we wanted to provide some insight into the drivers, many of which are transitional. Importantly, we expect expense growth to moderate as we progress through the year, even excluding the impact of cost synergies. In the first quarter, we recognized $8 million in additional T&amp;E expenses as we saw a limited resumption of travel relative to the last 2 years. We\\'ve also saw a $10 million increase in advertising expense associated with our Mobility division. Investments in growth initiatives contributed to $28 million of the increase. We are specifically disclosing the increase from what we\\'re calling a step-up impact in the quarter. This relates to increases in expenses that we view as a re-establishment of baseline cost. The return of in-person events included several major conferences in the first quarter as Doug mentioned. Together, these live events added more than $20 million of incremental expense relative to last year when these events were still virtual. Step-up costs also incorporate a comprehensive process to align compensation practices across our employee base. One of these changes is to harmonize the timing of annual merit increases to March from April. The pull-forward of that merit increase costs one month of impact in the first quarter that did not occur in the year ago periods. We also recognized $15 million in additional expense related to the ongoing cloud transition. Free cash flow excluding certain items was $701 million in the first 3 months of 2022. Note that this is meant to reflect the estimated free cash flow of the combined company as if the merger were closed on January 1, 2022. We will provide some additional color on the drivers of our cash balance and our gross debt in the next few slides. Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong with ample liquidity. As of the end of the first quarter, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.4 billion and debt of $11.4 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITA at the end of the first quarter was 2.57x. As you can see, our cash balance declined sequentially to $4.4 billion. The single largest drive in the reduction was a $7 billion in cash paid to fund the first tranche of our 2022 $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program. We also received net proceeds from divestitures of $2.6 billion and net proceeds of $2.3 billion from the issuance of debt. Now to gross debt. We issued $5.5 billion of new debt in the first quarter, $3.5 billion of which has been allocated to refinancing existing debt. After the quarter closed, we also made a final debt redemption payment of $600 million, which brought our adjusted gross debt leverage down to 2.47x. Now, I\\'d like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the first quarter, we have achieved $23 million in cost synergies, and our current annualized run rate is $135 million. While we are already seeing significant progress in pipeline and customer conversations, with only 1 month as a combined company, revenue synergies are negligible. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the first quarter is $365 million. Now let\\'s turn to the division results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 7% with growth across all product lines. Expenses increased 8% primarily due to factors I mentioned earlier. Investments in technology, especially cloud transition cost and continued investment in strategic initiatives like ESG. Segment operating profit increased 5% and the segment operating profit margin decreased 60 basis points to 29%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 60 basis points to 30%. You can see on the slide our operating profit from the OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division. The JV contributed $26 million in adjusted operating profit to the company because the JV is a 50% owned joint venture, operating independent of the company, we do not include the financial results of OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category, and on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 7%, Data &amp; Advisory solutions revenue grew 12%, Enterprise Solutions revenue grew 2%, and Credit &amp; Risk Solutions revenue grew 8%. As Doug discussed at length, ratings faced a challenging issuance environment in the first quarter with revenue declining 15% year-over-year. Expenses increased 7% primarily due to compensation expense and information service cost partially offset by lower occupancy cost. This resulted in a 25% decrease in segment operating profit and 820 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased approximately 105 basis points to 62%. Non-transaction revenue increased 7% primarily due to growth in fees associated with surveillance and growth in CRISIL revenue. Transaction revenue decreased 31% on the soft issuance already discussed. This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in Ratings revenue were the 21% decrease in corporates and the 12% decrease in structured finance, driven predominantly by structured credit. In addition, financial services decreased 9%, governments decreased 11% and the CRISIL and other category increased 12%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 14%. Return of in-person conferences, most notably CERAWeek and World Petrochemical Conference drove 70% year-over-year growth in Advisory &amp; Transactional Services revenue. Excluding the impact of CERAWeek, revenue growth would have been 8% year-over-year. Global Trading Services had a great quarter, increasing 17%, mainly due to strong fuel oil and iron ore volumes. As Doug noted earlier, GTS revenue often picks up when commodity prices become more volatile, which we certainly witnessed in the first quarter. Expenses increased 18% primarily due to cost associated with the return of in-person conferences and headcount and compensation expense. Excluding the impact of CERAWeek, expenses would have increased 10% year-over-year. Segment operating profit increased 8% and the segment operating profit margin decreased 210 basis points to 43%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 43%. In addition to the exceptional quarter in Advisory &amp; Transactional Services, we saw strong demand driving growth in price assessments and energy and resources, data and insights. Growth was partially offset by a modest decrease in Upstream data and insights. Though we note positive signs of inflection in the Upstream business, but for the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, Upstream would have had its second consecutive quarter of positive ACV growth, which is a leading indicator for revenue. We also saw a dramatic improvement in retention in the Upstream business as retention rates improved by more than 10 full percentage points over the last 12-month. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in Planning Solutions and Used Car offerings. Expenses grew 11% on increased advertising expense in the quarter and headcount growth in 2021, as the business restores capacity to better align with strong growth over the past 18 months. This resulted in an 8% growth in adjusted operating profit and 80 basis points of margin contraction year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased approximately 400 basis points to 39%. Dealer revenue increased to 12% year-over-year benefiting from successful prior period promotions and from retention rates that remain above pre-COVID levels. Growth in manufacturing was 3% year-over-year related to the well-publicized supply chain challenges faced by automotive OEMs. Financials and other increased 12%, driven primarily by strength in our insurance underwriting products. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices delivered strong revenue growth of 14% year-over-year, primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices. During the quarter, expenses increased 9%, largely due to strategic investments, increased compensation and IT costs. Segment operating profit increased 16% and the segment operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 69.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased approximately 10 basis points to 68%. Every category increased revenue this quarter. Asset linked fees increased 15%, primarily from AUM driven gains in ETFs, mutual funds and insurance. Exchange traded derivative revenue increased 22% on the increased trading volumes. Data and customs subscriptions increased 4%. Over the past year, ETF net inflows were $286 billion and market appreciation totaled $244 billion. This resulted in quarter ending ETF AUM of $2.9 trillion, which is 22% higher compared to 1 year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 24% year-over-year. Sequentially versus the end of the fourth quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $68 billion and market depreciation totaled $123 billion. Within our Engineering Solutions division we saw 7% revenue growth, driven primarily by growth in non-subscription offerings, most notably the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. Investment in growth initiatives and an increase in royalty expense led to a 5% increase in adjusted expenses This resulted in segment operating profit growth of 17% and 160 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin contracted approximately 115 basis points to 20%. Subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions increased 3% year-over-year, while non-subscription revenue increased 60% over the same period. Now moving to our guidance. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance, and this slide depicts our updated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance. For revenue, we now expect a low single-digit increase year-over-year, reflecting the issuance environment, partially offset by the strength we are seeing in our non-Ratings businesses. We now expect corporate unallocated expense between $85 million and $95 million, approximately $30 million lower than our previous guidance on lower forecast incentive compensation and professional fees. Interest expense is expected in the range of $360 million to $370 million, down $10 million from prior guidance. This is due to a slightly lower average cost of debt than we initially expected. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $165 million and free cash flow, excluding certain items in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. There is no change to our expectations for deal-related amortization, operating profit margin expansion or tax rate. This slide illustrates our guidance by division. For Ratings, we now expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits and for margins to be in the low to mid-60s. This compares to previous guidance calling for low single-digit revenue growth and margins in the mid-60s. Our outlook for other segments is unchanged from previous guidance. Overall, we are incredibly encouraged by the team\\'s ability to execute so well even in the current macro environment. We are focused on the enormous long-term opportunity ahead of us as a combined company, and we are more confident than ever in our ability to execute against that opportunity. Our differentiated data, insights, analytics and services help our customers to thrive and accelerate progress. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Mark Grant Thank you, Ewout. For those on the line, if you would like to ask a question, please press \"*\", \"1\" and record your name. To cancel or withdraw your question, simply press \"*\", \"2\". Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up in order to allow time for other callers during today\\'s Q&amp;A session. Operator, we will now take our first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You\\'ve updated your full year outlook for debt issuance. Can you discuss what your expectations are for issuance on a quarterly basis directionally? And how much of your guidance increase or guidance update reflects performance in the quarter compared to performance over the rest of the year? Doug Peterson Thanks for that question. This is Doug. Let me start with that. Well, knowing that issuance is going to be one of the key questions that we\\'re going to be talking about, let me just review a little bit what we saw during the quarter and then some of the expectations for the rest of the year. As you know, it was a very weak quarter for issuance. We saw that the total global issuance was down 9% excluding bank loan ratings and 12% including bank loan ratings. We saw, as an example, U.S. bonds were down 22%; U.S. corporates were down almost 50%; and high yield globally was down 68%, and the U.S. was down 75%. So, with that backdrop, as you see, we\\'ve looked towards the rest of the year. We expect that issuance during the second quarter will be recovering, but not necessarily to the full extent that it would have been compared to last year. And the second half of the year, the comparables are not quite as difficult as they were earlier in the year, and we do believe that there will be a rebound in issuance given the situation and current positioning in the market. But let me hand it over to Ewout, who will provide some more color. Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, George. Indeed, as Doug said, we are expecting still the second quarter to see some impact with respect to our quarterly expectations, but then to see some improvement in the second half of this year and particularly also because the comps will get easier during the second half of this year. I also would like to point out, of course, the benefits we have of the broader company we are at this point in time because five of our -- the six divisions are performing in line or better than expectations. We will see during the course of this year coming in the benefits from our cost synergies, the benefits from our buyback program and so on. So that should help drive the earnings per share growth in a very strong way during the rest of the year. Hence, that we\\'re still guiding to double-digit EPS growth for the full year. So definitely, those elements will help to strengthen the performance of the company during the course of 2022. George Tong Got it. That\\'s helpful. And just a follow-up on that point. You mentioned that five of the six divisions are performing in line or better than expectations. Can you elaborate on which of the segments actually outperformed your initial expectations heading into the quarter? And what were the key factors driving the upside performance? Ewout Steenbergen Yes, let me give you a quick overview for each of the divisions and happy to go deeper in some of the next questions. But for example, Market Intelligence, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity. The first conversations we are having with customers are really showing the benefit of the combined company. And we saw actually the subscription revenue going up in a very strong way, actually growing more in the double-digit space. Commodity Insights, very strong commercial momentum. The main issue with respect to the Russian revenue impact will be in Commodity Insights, but we expect to be able to offset a significant part of that based on the very strong commercial momentum we are seeing and also very excited about what we can offer our customers on a combined basis. Mobility, clearly some positive trends as well as we have pointed out, particularly because we see higher retention of our customers. The Index business, a strong AUM growth. Keep in mind, we are looking at this year-over-year. And of course, we started at much lower AUM levels at the beginning of 2021, and then also the derivative activity and volumes are much higher. And then you also saw Engineering Solutions growing in a healthy way during the quarter. So overall, we think that our businesses are very well-positioned, five of the six and that the issues with respect to the debt issuance environment are very isolated within the Ratings division itself. And also keep in mind that we have a significant component in Ratings with respect to non-transaction revenue. So that is clearly also an element of stability and offset for the overall transactional revenue. Doug Peterson Thanks, George. George Tong Very helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik Thank you. So, the negative 5% issuance forecast obviously is much different than what Moody\\'s reported yesterday. And I was just hoping for -- is there some sensitivity perhaps you can provide us in terms of if things get worse, how that would impact your guidance? Or does the EPS range account for that flat to down 14% that you talked about earlier? Doug Peterson Yes. Well, first of all, let me share with you a little bit more about what our outlook is for the full year and what some of the sensitivities are in that forecast. As you know, we are expecting that the overall issuance of bonds will be down 5% for 2022. But if you look at what the components are in the corporates, we already saw very weak issuance in the first quarter. And so we\\'ve forecasted to be a 12% decline for the full year with a downside of up to 25%. And it could recover and have a 5% -- down 5% full year. We do see strength in financial services. They continue to outpace the issuance last year. We expect it for the full year will be up 2%. But again, with the current environment, that could drop to up to 5% down. Structured finance and U.S. public finance could be down at 7% this year. That\\'s what our current forecast is, and they could also see downside up to 12%. And then there\\'s other factors such as international public finance that as well would be down 2%. But as you know, we are very close to the markets. We watch what\\'s happening. Our forecast is based on many, many different factors. We look at what is the current situation of maturing bonds in the market whether it\\'s on people\\'s balance sheets. As you know, there was very little -- hardly any issuance at all of either loans, high-yield loans or high-yield bonds during the first quarter. There\\'s a pipeline out there that still wants to go to the markets. We also know that there is a set of M&amp;A transactions which have not been completed. There\\'s $1 trillion of private equity capital on the sideline that still has not been deployed. So, we look at all of these factors and weigh them together to come up with our estimate for the year of 5% down. So, this isn\\'t just one single factor that goes into it. We are looking across many, many different factors. And as Ewout just said, we also expect that through the year, there will be recovery in issuance as we keep going deeper into the year. Manav Patnaik Got it. And then maybe somewhat similarly just on the Indices side of the business, what\\'s embedded in the assumption in terms of at least the asset-linked fees portion of the business? Ewout Steenbergen Yes, we are always looking, Manav, at the actual asset levels. And then we are assuming with respect to the growth and market appreciation, a very modest development for the remainder of the year. But keep in mind that this is a business where we have the natural offset, the partial hedge because if the asset levels will come down, we see the derivative trading activity going up and the other way around. And as you have seen this quarter, actually, the Index business has performed very well based on those kind of dynamics. So, if you look at it historically, the Index business actually has been growing revenues for many, many years in a row in very volatile market circumstances, very different circumstances over the years. And that is exactly due to the dynamics of the business and the business model that we have the different revenue streams in the Index business. Manav Patnaik Got it. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Manav. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about the margins. You kept the adjusted pro forma operating margin flat. Obviously, there\\'ll be some Ratings weakness. I\\'m imagining that\\'s maybe offset by some of the other segments. But just talk about anything sort of on the cost side, maybe labor inflation, how that’s trending? Just what are the risks to the margin guide? And what gives you the sort of confidence to stay at that level despite the Ratings weakness? Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Ton. You\\'re right. There are many different elements that go in the mix with respect to our margin expectation. But let me first reemphasize our margin expectations. So, what we are guiding to is still 130 basis points margin expansion during 2022. And the reason is we will see some natural growth in our businesses. We, of course, have our business as usual expense growth based on the activities of the business. We, of course, have some impact of the overall compensation environment. We have done some targeted increases in certain job groups. We have raised the merit in certain jurisdictions, a bit higher than we have done in previous years. But then at the same time, we also have several management actions that we are taking. Definitely, in the current environment, we\\'re, of course, very careful from an expense perspective. So, we will see benefits from some of those management actions. We also have the benefit of some of our variable expenses that will come down during the course of this year. And then if you layer on top of that the cost synergies that will be very meaningful and significant, we are actually very pleased that in an environment -- macro environment where we are today, that we, as a company, still can improve our margins, increase our margins in a very significant way. Toni Kaplan That\\'s great. And then just on the revenue side, I\\'m sure you mentioned it. I just happened to miss it. The organic growth expectation for the year, are you still sort of expecting the same 6.5% to 8% for the next 2 years? Just any update on overall organic growth? And maybe just how the different levers -- is pricing easier this year because of the rising cost environment, et cetera? Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen Yes. Toni, with respect to our own effort, 6.5% to 8% revenue growth for \\'22 and \\'23 combined, we have no reason to back away from that at this point in time. But obviously, we will continue to monitor that very closely. And the reason is that, as we mentioned, five of our six divisions are performing in line or better than expected. So, the main question is when is the issuance environment coming back. And we have been in that movie many times before. If you look back for the last decade, there\\'s maybe three situations where the issuance environment was negative, and there were impacts on the Ratings revenue. But what we usually have seen then is after one or a few quarters, that came back in a very strong way. So, it is really the matter of the uncertainty about the timing when that is coming back. So, for that reason, we have no reason at this moment to back away from our revenue expectations for \\'22 and \\'23 combined. Toni Kaplan Thanks very much. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Toni. Operator Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra Thanks for taking my question. So first on the cost synergies, pretty good progress in the quarter itself. So, I was wondering if you could drill down further on how -- what kind of traction you\\'re seeing on that front? How should we think about the quarterly cadence this year? And any initial feedback from the cost takeout? Ewout Steenbergen Yes. Thank you, Ashish. I think it\\'s important first to point out that we are in these results only 1-month in as a combined company. So, in that context that we are already being able to report $123 million of cost synergies on an annualized basis, we think actually that’s already a very strong indicator. With respect to the absolute number and the phasing of our cost synergies, nothing has changed compared to our information that we provided on March 1 during the merger call. But what is important to point out is that we made good progress. We are very comfortable and confident that we can hit those numbers. And you recall that we said that we will be able to achieve about $600 million of cost synergies in total and that we expect something like 35% to 40% in 2022, so realized in this year. And as I said, we are very confident that we are on track to hit those numbers. Ashish Sabadra That’s great color. And then maybe a follow-up question on the revenue synergies. Again, there was a reference to Kensho being used across the broader organization to automate processes and then also the strength in subscription on the MI front. So, question there was any initial feedback from your customers as you started integrating some of the IHS Markit data into the global marketplaces and traction or ability to cross-sell, upsell those INFO products into SMB customer base and the other way around? Thanks. Doug Peterson Let me start with that. We’ve been thrilled with the response we\\'ve been getting from our customers as we started the merger and working together. We’ve been able to get all of our teams merged within the divisions commercial team. So, they\\'re out listening to customers. Ewout and I have been out listening to customers and hearing what they talk about. They\\'re talking a lot about ESG, about energy transition, about some of the key thesis of this deal where we began with. In addition, they\\'re interested in data and AI and machine learning, how they can link their data with ours.  And we\\'ve seen that our commercial organizations have already been out in the market. We have strong pipelines of cross-sell within all the divisions. We also have a set of products that we\\'ll be looking at over time. As you know, the merger will be very powerful for us, but the main synergies coming from the revenue side are built towards the back end. But we are already seeing very, very strong relationships with customers, very good dialogue and with all of the different areas that were the core thesis of the deal itself. Ashish Sabadra That’s great color, Doug. Congrats on solid results. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Ashish. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe just as a follow-up to what you just talked about on the Market Intelligence commercial opportunities. Can you maybe give a little bit more detail how exactly you\\'ve integrated the sales force? I think historically speaking, S&amp;P over the last few years has moved to a very enterprise license approach. I think IHS Markit was very product specialist-focused. So just wondering what exactly commercially you\\'ve made changes on already? And if there\\'s opportunity to maybe as you align things to pick up a little incremental revenue synergies quickly? Doug Peterson Yes. So, thank you for that. As you pointed out, we had really two different approaches. At Market Intelligence at S&amp;P Global, we generally had more of an approach that was an enterprise model. It gave us an opportunity for customers to have all of the users having access to the products and services, where financial services comes in with an approach where some of their products are priced more on a per user basis or a volume basis. There are some of the products within the new Market Intelligence, which came from IHS Markit that are going to be priced differently because they\\'re installed software, which for us is an exciting new area, also some of the enterprise services that are provided as well. So, some of those are not going to necessarily fit within the product merger. But there are a lot of opportunities that we\\'ve seen of moving data, which is within the IHS Markit, things like bond pricing, reference pricing, moving that into the Desktop. In addition, there\\'s data that we have for even something that we\\'ve had as long as Compustat, where some of that data can be moved into the products and services that are software solutions. So, the commercial teams have been brought together. There\\'s been immediate cross-training so that every single person from both of the two companies understand the products of each other. We’ve also seen opportunities for the traditional cross-sell customers that don\\'t have products on one side or the other that we started servicing. And as I mentioned, some of the biggest themes in ESG. We have the new scores, which we have 11,000 scores, which we\\'ve taken and put them into the Desktop. We can put those into many other areas. So, we see ESG as a theme, data as a theme. There\\'s a lot of interest in credit risk. Private markets is another area. So, it\\'s only been 1 month for this quarter since we closed. It\\'s been 2 months since we closed, but the enthusiasm, the momentum is excellent. Alex Kramm Thanks for the color. Thank you, there. And maybe a direct follow-up standing or keeping it on Market Intelligence. Still a very large portion of the combined business seems to be true subscription-based, but just wondering if you could talk about the cyclicality in this business a little bit more. When I look at your press release, recurring variable fees were down 13% year-over-year. And I guess that hit the Enterprise Solutions revenue only up 2%. So maybe just flush out what exactly those variable components are that were impacting you on a year-over-year basis. And as you think about the remainder of the year with capital markets a little bit choppy, what the impacts could be here on the Market Intelligence side that we should be thinking about as this business seems a little bit more cyclical than maybe the core Market Intelligence previously? Ewout Steenbergen Alex, yes, let me give you a bit of the breakdown and explanation what is happening exactly in recurring variable. You\\'re right. If you look at MI as a whole, approximately 83% is subscription-based, 5% is non-subscription. And then you have that category in between that is subscription variable at approximately 12%. There you see a bit more impact from market fluctuations, capital market fluctuations because that\\'s the business that has some of those capital markets platforms, some of the origination platforms, some of the equity platforms. And that is being impacted by some of the general M&amp;A and capital market activity and issuance environment that we are seeing, both in fixed income and equity in the markets. And yes, that is a market and a business where you see a bit of that impact. But overall, you see that the Market Intelligence, nevertheless, was growing in a very strong way. And when we see more stability in the markets over time, when we see the M&amp;A environment coming back, we would also expect to see the subscription variable component growing faster again. So that’s the underlying dynamic that is happening in the MI business. Alex Kramm All right. Very helpful. Thanks again. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Alex. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open. Andrew Nicholas Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start with issuance or drill -- drill into the issuance expectations a bit further. I realized that it was a really tough first quarter on that front. But I’m curious, when you gave your guidance on March 1 with the merger call, I think you had some sense of at least February weakness in high yield. Could you spend some time talking about maybe what specifically changed in the outlook over the past 2 months? Has it been a weaker-than-expected April? Or are there certain subsegments or asset classes that have deteriorated more quickly than you expected? That would be helpful. Doug Peterson Well, first of all, thank you for the question and drilling down a little bit more, there\\'s really two key factors. First of all, if you looked at the high-yield issuance in February then into March and into April, it has been quite weak. There\\'s times when we\\'ve gone an entire week and even longer without even one issuer coming to market. Given the external environment, that\\'s also had a change. If you go back to the beginning of March, the last time we spoke, there had -- the invasion of Ukraine had just started. We hadn\\'t seen yet the major impact on the markets of volatility of the energy markets and commodity markets. And we also, at the time, didn\\'t have any clear guidance yet from the Fed what they were going to be doing on interest rates. So, if I take a step back and look at very specific dynamics in the high-yield market itself, when will that be coming back and what are our expectations. And then second, the overall macroeconomic geopolitical environment and then more specifically in the U.S., we are just starting to get a window into what will be the programs that the Fed is going to institute to try to combat inflation and the timing of some of their interest rate increases. Andrew Nicholas Makes sense. Thank you for the color. And then sticking with Ratings for my follow-up. Obviously, transaction revenue has the headwinds we\\'ve talked about. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for non-transaction revenue growth if I didn\\'t miss that? Obviously, a really strong year last year on that front. I think there were some one-time items in 2021. But if you could talk about your expectations for non-transaction revenue in that segment, that would be helpful. Thanks again. Ewout Steenbergen So, if you look at non-transaction, there is a bit of a mix of elements that go into that bucket. What we see is particularly strength in annual fees. So, for example, that is surveillance, and of course, with more bonds and loans outstanding after the very strong issuance environment over the last 2 years, we see some benefit from that. Also, frequent issuer fees are going in that category. So that is also very stable. And at the same time, we see also the CRISIL performance that goes in non-transaction being very strong. So CRISIL is growing very rapidly, both on the domestic Indian Ratings business as well as in the global research, risk and benchmarking business. Where we see in the non-transaction bucket the revenue are not moving up, it\\'s mostly Rating Evaluation Services, less M&amp;A activity. So that is impacting Rating Evaluation Service and also new issuer credit ratings. Given the current environment, we also see less activity there. Nevertheless, of course, 7% is a nice growth for non-transaction. We would probably see that slowing down that growth a little bit for the remainder of the year, but I would expect it still to be in a positive territory. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Andrew Steinerman Hi. I also wanted to ask about issuance. When looking at Slide 18, the minus 5% forecast, I just wanted to know if that issuance forecast is for all credit issuance or just weighted issuance? I know usually they\\'re similar. But in this case, my question is, is there a large difference between the minus 5%? And if I ask you just for kind of rated issuances, and I don\\'t quite get that footnote, like is China included in credit for the minus 5% or not? Doug Peterson Yes. Take this as an estimate for global issuance. This is what our team looks at. It includes all markets and all types of issuance. It\\'s the exact same base that we use when we talk about what the overall issuance has been quarter-by-quarter. Andrew Steinerman And would rated issuance be much different than minus 5%? Doug Peterson Yes, rated issuance would be -- if you look at -- if you could adjust a little bit for Asia, where the fees are not quite the same and there\\'s issuance in China still a different kind of a market, but that\\'s the forecast that we use. It\\'s the basis we use for the guidance that we provided. Andrew Steinerman Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hans Hoffman Hi. This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Hamzah. Could you just comment a bit on what you\\'re seeing across your European revenue base? And how that region did relative to your expectations, either by segment or overall? Doug Peterson Yes. When we look at Europe, there\\'s a couple of different factors. First of all, on the Rating side, it was similar to the rest of the world. The issuance levels were down. We saw that in Europe itself that for the quarter, the corporate issuance is down about 25%. Financial services was down 13%. That compares to in the U.S., corporates are down almost 50%. Financial services were down less in the U.S., 5% versus the 13% in Europe. But in addition, Europe did have some strong structured finance issuance. But overall, Europe continues to be a market that we\\'re quite interested in because we see the transformation from a banking market to a capital market. There\\'s also very strong growth in ESG. Europe is one of the sectors and one of the regions of the world that\\'s really setting the fastest pace on ESG. We see a lot of interest there for the different ESG funds we\\'ve launched. We\\'ve seen fastest growth for S&amp;P 500 ESG and Dow Jones Sustainable Indices that have been launched. Europe is the pace setter there. And we also know that in Europe, there\\'s been a slower uptake of inflation. Right now, inflation is not quite as high as it is in the U.S. The ECB has not moved as fast when they are looking at increasing the core rates. So right now, the negative side of Europe is clearly that you\\'ve got the Ukraine invasion and that horrific war that\\'s going on there. And we will have to see what kind of impact that has on Europe. Europe is also impacted potentially by the energy markets. But net-net, our European businesses have been on the same pace as the rest that we\\'ve seen in the U.S. But there are a few downsides, but we also see a lot of upside as the market doesn\\'t have the same inflation impacts as well as the opportunities for the capital markets to play a much larger role. Hans Hoffman Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then just for my follow-up, could you just -- in terms of the portfolio post the deal, can you just comment on whether there are any further noncore assets that you\\'re looking to prune? Or is sort of most of that behind you now? And any update on your view and how you\\'re thinking about where your long-term leverage should be given the combined portfolio? Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Yes, first on the portfolio, we are very committed on driving growth and success of each of our businesses at this point in time. We see multiple opportunities, as we mentioned during the prepared remarks, of value creation across the enterprise. There\\'s a lot of cross links we are seeing with respect to revenue synergies. And I think it\\'s really exciting to see what we can do altogether. Having said that, you know us and our management style and philosophy will always be very disciplined portfolio managers. And we will always determine ultimately over time if we are the best owners of certain assets. But at this moment, really our focus on driving the economic value generation of the portfolio of businesses we have at S&amp;P Global. Hans Hoffman Okay. Thanks so much. Doug Peterson Thanks, Tom (sic) [Hans]. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Owen Lau Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. So, energy companies have been doing very well this year. Could you please remind us the competitive advantage of the Commodity Insight business? I mean, the demand of your offerings during this volatile period and how investors can understand better this business given that revenue is up 14% year-over-year? Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Owen Lau. Well, first of all, in this environment, the combination of Platts and IHS, the energy natural resources business is providing the knowledge and the resources that the markets look to in a volatile environment like this. Clearly, there\\'s a combination of volatility in the energy markets, both with gas and in oil. You see the commodities related to agriculture also going -- undergoing a lot of volatility. And we have a combination of the benchmarks, which are embedded in people\\'s contracts, in the research and the analytics. We have advisory services. We also have the energy transition that people are looking to. We have a combination of new products and services that we\\'re coming together with IHS Markit in carbon markets, in battery metals, in things that are the transition energy economy. So, we think that the two together really bring a powerful voice that people are looking to. And let me just end with something we talked about on the earnings -- on the prepared transcript, which was related to CERAWeek. CERAWeek is the premier conference for the energy industry. And this year, there are over 5,000 participants. And it was a very, very lively dialogue, including government officials talking about what\\'s the future of commodities. And we are really at the center of that dialogue and think that it\\'s one of the best times for us and one of the most exciting things about the combination. Owen Lau Got it. And I have two quick follow-up. One is cloud. You mentioned some of the cloud initiatives and investments. Could you please talk about some of your near-term and long-term goal of this initiative? And another quick one is on buyback. Should we expect -- from a modeling perspective, should we expect you would start the second tranche of the $5 billion remaining in the third quarter or not the right way to think about that? Thanks. Doug Peterson Let me start with the question about cloud. And one of the -- another one of the exciting things about the transformation with the merger is that we have an opportunity to have scale in all of our negotiations and discussions with our providers when it comes to cloud and our digital transformation. Both S&amp;P Global and IHS Markit, we are far advanced on cloud transformation. We are able to bring those two programs together and get scale. In addition, we have really interesting opportunities in data and data sciences that you\\'ll be hearing much more about in the future. But I will let Ewout answer the other part of your question. Ewout Steenbergen And maybe one quick addition on cloud. There is a bit of a bubble [ph] cost, mostly in Market Intelligence because we are still in the transition there in that particular segment from on-prem to the cloud. So, we would expect over time to see that expense growth to go away. So, it\\'s more transitional in terms of the expense impact on the Market Intelligence segment. With respect to the buyback question, Owen, we expect that the current $7 billion ASR program will be completed at the beginning of August. And then we are ready to enter into the next phase of our buyback program to complete the full $12 billion at the end of 2022. Owen Lau Got it. Thank you very much. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Owen. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open. Craig Huber Great. Thank you. My first question, historically, you guys have generally raised prices in your legacy portfolio, call it, 3% to 4%. How are you thinking about pricing this year, particularly with the new IHS assets? Or is the pricing would be up similar in that part of the portfolio this year? Ewout Steenbergen I think if you look at that, Craig, we always start with what is the added value we deliver for our customers. What is -- what will contribute in terms of usage, what kind of data sets are these, proprietary data sets, hard-to-achieve data sets, how are we embedded in workflows and processes? That is the starting point. And then we look at the overall value we generate for the enterprise and think about what is appropriate in terms of pricing and price increases for such a contract going forward. So, we don\\'t just look at that simply by a percentage. We always look at first, what do we deliver to the customers and then reason back to what is appropriate in terms of the economic level of the fee that we will charge to the customer. Craig Huber And then also on the cost synergy side, as you think out here longer term, if there\\'s going to be any upside to your cost synergy target, what segment or segments do you guys think it most likely would come in? Ewout Steenbergen Yes, that is a bit speculative, Craig, as you understand. So, I have to be careful answer that question in a too specific way. But you know our management philosophy and approach. We always will be looking to raise the bar to find new opportunities, to leave no stone unturned. We will be looking across the whole company about what we can do better, more efficient, where we can integrate, where we have opportunities to automate, where we can use AI and Kensho across the board. So that is what we are planning to do. I think you know that the biggest areas of integration will be in Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights and in Corporate. So, if we will find upside ultimately in synergies, most likely it\\'s in those areas. But again, we will be continuing to look for opportunities across the board. Craig Huber Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Craig. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Silber Thanks so much. I know it\\'s late, I will just ask one, and forgive me if you covered this already. I know you’ve talked about some of the cost synergies, but I want to just focus specifically on Ratings, where there probably won\\'t be a lot of cost synergies given the merger. How quickly can you adjust your expenses in that division when we see a kind of Ratings drop that we saw in the first quarter and something that you\\'re expecting in the second quarter? Thanks. Doug Peterson Well, first of all, clearly, Ratings has different levers they can pull. If we need to, we could move costs. When it comes to compensation, we could slow down hiring, we could slow down investments. But at the same time, as Ewout mentioned earlier, there are times where there\\'s variability in the issuance environment where you\\'ve seen big drops. We’ve always mentioned that you could see a quarter or two quarters with very weak issuance. So we also want to make sure that we don\\'t cut too quickly, too fast. We think that the markets are complex. There is growing. People want to see a variety of opinions. We\\'re also investing in ESG across the Ratings team. We have a specialized unit within the Ratings business that is doing sustainability analytics. We\\'re seeing high growth there. We want to make sure that all of our analysts are ready to provide any type of support for those markets. So clearly, there\\'s a lot of levers we can pull, and we will already do some of those. But at the same time, we want to make sure that we keep investing in that business because it\\'s so critical to our overall franchise. Ewout Steenbergen And one quick addition to Doug\\'s answer. Although you\\'re right, Jeff, that the direct cost synergies in Ratings will be relatively small, Ratings will be a beneficiary of cost synergies in the Corporate segment that is being allocated to all divisions. And because Ratings has a very large base in revenues and employees based on those allocation keys, Ratings will be, in the end, also significant beneficiary from the corporate cost synergies that we will accomplish. Jeff Silber Okay. That’s really helpful. Thanks so much. Doug Peterson Thanks, Jeff. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open. Jeff Meuler Yes. Thank you. On Mobility, you stressed that the retention rate is up relative to pre-pandemic. Just curious if you have the root cause analysis or have the thesis as to why? I guess, my concern would be cyclically used car sales are great, maybe unsustainably so right now. But I know there\\'s other things in there, the CARFAX for Life initiative, Automotive Mastermind, whatnot. So curious as to why it\\'s up and if you think it\\'s sustainable? Doug Peterson Yes. There\\'s a couple of opportunities there. One of them is that the overall mobility industry itself, the automotive industry is going through a lot of change. This is a time when dealers, OEMs as well as suppliers to the OEMs are looking for more and more information about the supply chain, about the supply chain disruption. They want to understand more about what\\'s happening at the dealer level, who\\'s walking in the cars, who\\'s walking into the dealership. In addition, there\\'s been a lot of changes in the financing environment. As you know, the dealers as well as the OEMs have been using a lot of information in the last few years with different types of rebates with low interest rate loans, low interest rate leases. And so, the market is really going through a lot of changes in addition to electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles. And with all of that, there is a value in having this data and analytics that come from the Mobility division embedded in people\\'s workflow. And we just see that there\\'s a high need for it right now in this disruptive environment and a lot of change going on. So, this is an area that we\\'re pleased to see that this kind of stickiness, especially in this kind of an environment. Jeff Meuler Got it. And then apologies if you gave this in response to Manav\\'s question. I missed it. But the revenue and EPS guidance ranges, do they embed the issuance forecast range? Or do you use the minus 5% point estimate? Ewout Steenbergen It\\'s based on management\\'s best estimates, our own internal forecasting models, which is the midpoint, the best estimate point that the Ratings Research Group has put out in terms of the issuance outlook. So that is that minus 5% level. Jeff Meuler Got it. Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Jeff. Operator Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Faiza Alwy Yes, hi. Good morning. Just a couple of clarifying questions, I guess. The first one on the Commodity business. I understand that growth was particularly strong this quarter because of the Advisory &amp; Transactional Services. But it does seem like you\\'re calling for some deceleration in the back half, just in the -- or in the rest of the year in the underlying business. So, I\\'m curious if you could just talk about some of the drivers in that business? Like how correlated is it to oil prices or other commodities? Or are you just being conservative on that business? Ewout Steenbergen Yes. Faiza, first of all, welcome to the call, and we are very happy that you\\'re part of the analyst group now covering us as a company. So first, on Commodity Insights in terms of the expectation in terms of revenue growth for the year, we have said mid single digits. And then in terms of margins, mid to high 40s. And nothing has changed there compared to what we said to you a few months ago. And what you see is maybe first, I should speak about the impact of the Russian situation and the fact that we have suspended our commercial activities with Russian customers. Overall, not material for the company as a whole, but the largest impact is in Commodity Insights. But as I said at the answer of a previous question, we are very pleased to see the commercial momentum in the Commodity Insights business, and we expect that they are able to make up a significant part of that during the course of this year. So that\\'s clearly a positive. You\\'re right that revenues looked a bit high during the quarter 14%. But take into account that we had that CERAWeek event that had a significant impact on revenues during the first quarter. If you take CERAWeek out, revenue increase was approximately 8% during the quarter. So still strong, but definitely at a different level. Final commentary is we are really excited to see what is happening in that business because you could say there is, in fact, really a benefit of two trends at the same time. Traditional energy doing well. Of course, with the current commodity prices, you see that producers are in a healthy situation. And then there is so much focus at the same time on energy transition that we will have a benefit of helping our customers on both angles, and that’s clearly driving some of the underlying growth in this division. And therefore, we are overall very, very optimistic and positive about the outlook for Commodity Insights. Faiza Alwy Great. Thank you. And then just on the Ratings margins specifically, if we assume like a downside scenario where maybe issuance volumes are at the low end of what you’ve talked about, which is I believe it was down 13%. Like is it fair to think about Ratings margins sort of in line with what you did this quarter, like around 59%? Is that the right way to think about those margins? Ewout Steenbergen Well, we are not giving any particular guidance on a downside scenario in a quantitative way. So, I would like to be careful to answer your question in too much specifics. I think the overall perspective that we have on the Ratings business is that at some point, we will see the issuance environment coming back. We have seen this in many times in the past. At some point, this will improve. And we really think that we should lower the level of anxiety around all of this because there is uncertainty around timing. But ultimately, we have always said there could be one or a few quarters where Ratings revenue will be under pressure. But if you are having a mid- to long-term perspective of the company, nothing has changed with respect to outstanding debt. Nothing has changed with respect to overall trends and correlations with GDP and other growth drivers. So, the secular trends in this business are still there. Maybe short-term, there could be some fluctuations. But if the perspective is more mid to long-term, I think nothing is different with respect to the overall activity of the markets and also the economics of the business, both the top line growth and the margin expectations for the Ratings business. Faiza Alwy Understood. Thank you so much. Ewout Steenbergen Faiza. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Your line is open. Simon Clinch Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just quickly on the Rating side. I was wondering if you could help me just reconcile how to think about the transactional revenue streams relative to our own assumptions around the global issuance growth? Because clearly, in the first quarter, the transaction revenues a lot more than the issuance due to mix, I presume. I’m just wondering as the growth comes back, do we -- should we anticipate growth to far outpace issuance on the upside, and what are the nuances that we need to consider? Doug Peterson Yes. Well, first of all, you\\'re right that there\\'s a different kind of mix and different sort of revenue profile. This last quarter, we did have many of the issuers that were out in the market, which were the frequent issuers that have a different pricing profile than those which are more transactional. So, we do look carefully at the mix. The more high yield, sometimes there\\'s higher volumes, higher pricing there as opposed to some of the frequent issuers. So, it\\'s something to watch, but there\\'s no necessary -- no specific guideline, but mix is important when you look at the transaction revenues. Simon Clinch Okay. That’s great. And just as a follow-up to the question about Commodity Insights. I was kind of curious, as you get the conference business coming back as we had in the first quarter, does that typically lead to better growth, organic growth when you strip away the conference benefit in the first quarter. Does that generally lead to better growth in the future quarters versus environments where you just don\\'t have that conference business? Doug Peterson Yes. The conferences are clearly a critical part of our brand building and relationship building. As you know, across all of our businesses, we think about our relationships as long-term professional relationships that we manage in a way that we always want to bring the best products and best services. And our conferences serve as a way to convene thought leadership. They allow us to convene the leaders across industries. And that always gives us opportunities to improve our ACV, improve our relationships, improve our access to clients. So, it\\'s not -- you can\\'t find necessarily a direct relationship. But there\\'s definitely an indirect relationship over time that allows us to build our customer revenues and ensure that we are really relevant to the markets. Simon Clinch That’s really helpful. Thanks very much. Doug Peterson Thanks, Simon. Operator Thank you. Our last question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum Hi. Thank you very much for squeezing me in. I just want to start just on the energy side. Doug, maybe you could talk a little bit. The legacy INFO assets took a little bit of time to turn whenever there was an upturn in the energy markets, but we used to get some good indications in terms of accelerated consulting business and other things that were kind of a precursor to things getting a lot better. I was wondering if you\\'re seeing the same things in the business right now. Is the fact that some of the energy prices spiking have to do with the war making it that it\\'s not the same kind of demand that we would have normally seen? Just a little bit of context around that. And then I have a quick follow-up. Doug Peterson Yes. I think there\\'s three factors I would like to mention. One of them you talked about, which is the war and the very specific environment right now with the volatility of energy prices as other commodity prices, including metals and agriculture. This is creating a lot of demand for knowledge, for thought leadership, for opening up stronger relationships. And the second, I would say, really relates to energy transition, which is a longer-term view that companies and governments are very interested in what will be the long-term impact of the shift to cleaner and renewable energy environment. And there\\'s a lot of discussion going on right now about transition energy, what\\'s the future of natural gas. These also open up opportunities for all of the businesses. And then the third is, relates to the -- all of this together is the Upstream business. As Ewout talked about earlier, the Upstream business has been -- really had been decreasing over the last few years. And it seems as if in this current environment and with all of the investments that have been made that, that business is now going to be seeing a bottom and starting to grow again. So, we think that net-net, all of the businesses together position us very well to be able to address all of the needs and the opportunities in the future of the energy and commodities businesses. Shlomo Rosenbaum Okay, great. Thank you. And then a quick question. Just -- you talked about targeted merit increases and increased retention. What has retention been since the acquisition closed a couple of months ago? Just the overall level of people that are -- you really want to retain to really drive this business forward. On the fringes, is it a little bit more challenging? Are you happy with the way that you\\'re retaining the people? It really is key for the deal. So, I wanted to just hear how you\\'re doing 2 months in. Doug Peterson Yes. Thank you for that. And 2 months in, we are thrilled with the results. Our people are excited. They\\'re motivated. One of the key indicators we look at is people changing their LinkedIn profile to say S&amp;P Global, which is very high. We find that the people have been motivated by the vision, the purpose and the values of S&amp;P Global as we’ve come together. And it\\'s too early. It\\'s just really 1 month in, 2 months in for us to give you any trends. But all of the informal indicators are very strong that we\\'ve been able to bring the team together that\\'s very motivated and people want to ensure that we have a successful future. Shlomo Rosenbaum Great. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Shlomo. Well, let me finish and thank everyone for joining the call. And I want to elaborate on the question that Shlomo just asked, which is about how things are going. We are thrilled that we were able to close this quarter and be able to have that merger come together after 15 months. All of the teams have come together so well as you\\'ve heard us discuss during this call, the ability to find opportunities from what we are hearing from our customers to bring our organization together at every single level, including our commercial teams that are out there looking for ways to sell and to innovate and bring new products to the market. In addition, we think that we are off to a great start on integration and the ability to bring the two teams together in a way that not only do we create value through cost synergies, but they were also positioning ourselves for growth for the future. The more we get to know about IHS Markit and S&amp;P Global together, the more we know that we validated that this was the right thing to do, that the two companies together are stronger than either would have been alone. And finally, when it comes to what Shlomo just asked about our people, we are very excited to see the way that our people have come together with a strong executive committee that’s developed a set of visions and purposes and values that across the company, we are all talking about, we are committed to. And we think that we are off to a fantastic start, and we appreciate all of the questions today and all the support from the analysts as well as our shareholders and very importantly, our people. So again, thank you very much for the call today. Operator That concludes this morning\\'s call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in about 2 hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&amp;P Global\\'s website for 1 year.

In today’s earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation’s operating performance between periods and to view the corporation’s business from the same perspective as management. The earnings release and the slides contain exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This call, especially discussion of our outlook, contains statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in our filings with the SEC and on our website. I would also like to call your attention to a European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&amp;P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Ola Fadahunsi at 212-438-2296. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug? Doug Peterson Thank you, Chip. Welcome to everyone joining today’s earnings call. The first thing I’d like to do is thank our people at S&amp;P Global for their dedication and commitment throughout 2021. We have asked a lot of our people this year as they do their day jobs, while also preparing for the expected merger with IHS Markit and all the while dealing with the uncertainty of the pandemic. So on behalf of the Board and our management team, thank you. Now, let me turn to the key financial achievements in 2021. S&amp;P Global delivered 12% organic revenue growth and 17% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. All four businesses contributed with growth in both revenue and adjusted operating profit margin. This is quite an achievement following the remarkable results of 2020. We generated $3.5 billion of free cash flow, excluding certain items and returned $743 million in dividends. In addition to the very strong financial results, we made significant progress on our key initiatives as well. Clearly, the most important initiative of the year has been on preparation for the merger and the multiple rounds of synergy validation. Upon closing of the merger, we are well prepared to rapidly begin operating as one company and to begin to realize both the cost and revenue synergies we have already outlined to you. In fact, on a run-rate basis, we have already achieved pre-realized synergies of $25 million by the end of 2021. Also, after the merger is completed, we will host a post-merger investor call to provide an update on the merged company strategy, business segment details, synergies, investment programs, share repurchase plans, and guidance. The other key initiatives achieved in 2021 include the rapid progress achieved on our 2020 multiyear productivity program, numerous new product launches and expanded product capabilities resulting from our strategic investment initiatives, the creation of Sustainable1 to manage and drive significant expansion in coordination with ESG product offerings across the company; the launch of S&amp;P Platts Dimensions Pro, a fully integrated user experience connecting pricing, market commentary, news and analytics with special emphasis on energy transition; and continued progress in China with one example being the issuance of 57 domestic ratings in China, up over 150% from 2020. This included the first dual-rated bond. I will provide more detail on many of these items in today’s call. These are the strategic initiatives that we shared with you on our fourth quarter earnings call last year. We made great strides in each of these items and we will remark in more detail on many of them today. To recap the financial results for the full year, organic revenue increased 12% to $8.3 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 15%. Our adjusted operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 55.2%. And we delivered a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. It’s important to note that adjusted EPS of $13.70 far exceeded our original 2021 guidance of $12.25 to $12.45 and that the adjusted operating profit margin of 55.2% far exceeded our original guidance of 53.8% to 54.3%. Much of this was due to unexpected outperformance in ratings following what was a very strong 2020. Ewout will review our fourth quarter financial performance in a moment. All four divisions delivered revenue growth and adjusted operating profit improvement. The largest revenue gain was the 16% in Indices. After several years of elevated investment spending, Market Intelligence delivered the largest adjusted operating profit margin increase with a gain of 190 basis points. It’s important to remember that our 2021 financial results are part of a solid track record of performance. Over the past 4 years, we have posted a compound annual growth rate of 8% for revenue and we have averaged 217 basis points per year of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. And this has resulted in a nearly doubling of our adjusted diluted EPS over that timeframe. The company also continued to advance its own industry leading practices in sustainability. We issued our 10th Annual Sustainability Impact Report and 3rd Annual TCFD Report. We expanded parental leave to 26 weeks and introduced a flexible time-off policy with no prescribed maximum in all eligible jurisdictions. We established a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility tied to our published Science Based Target goals, one of the first sustainability-linked banking facilities in the U.S. Our S&amp;P Global Foundation increased its grants by 30% to $15 million to organizations that support COVID-19 relief, diversity, economic inclusion and environmental sustainability. And our efforts have been recognized by several leading third-parties. While we continue to improve our own internal sustainability programs, we are investing in our ESG business. In 2021, we launched Sustainable1 to elevate and coordinate external ESG efforts across the company. This resulted in ESG revenue of $98 million, a 51% increase over 2020. All our key ESG products contributed to this growth. We completed 59 ESG evaluations, up 48%; 43 Green Evaluations, up 79%; 103 SAM benchmark engagements, up 36%; and we launched social and sustainability framework alignment opinions and completed 42 of them. We ended 2021 with ESG ETF AUM reaching $32.2 billion, an increase of 59% versus year end 2020. At the core of our ESG efforts are the corporate sustainability assessments. These are a key differentiator versus our competitors as they enable us to collect an enormous amount of data directly from corporations around the world. For the methodology year that ends in March, we have already increased CSA survey participation by 58% to 2,190 companies. We also enhanced ESG offerings available on Capital IQ Pro, expanded S&amp;P Global ESG scores coverage to 11,500 companies and expanded coverage of climate risk analytics to more than 3 million physical assets such as mines, power stations and buildings. In addition to excellent commercial progress and expanded capabilities, we also launched numerous new ESG products and initiatives in 2021. While I don’t have time to delve into each one of them, let me just comment on a few. Second Party Opinions assess a transaction against a sustainable finance framework for alignment with consistent and comparable market principles and standards. Climate changes created the need to evaluate the impact of different climate-related scenarios on counterparties, investments and portfolios. To support these efforts, Market Intelligence and Oliver Wyman created Climate Credit Analytics, a climate scenario analysis and credit analytics model suite. And in December, we acquired the Climate Service. The company sells the Climanomics platform, a tool that quantifies physical climate risk for corporates, investors and governments. Kensho continues to be a driving force for productivity improvement for the company and increasingly for our customers. The key capabilities they have created are listed on this slide. Codex is an AI-powered document viewer that enables efficient navigation and extraction of relevant information from large quantities of documents. There have been over 300,000 client uses to-date. Codex is available on Capital IQ Pro. Kensho AGAVE has transformed Platts’ process for creating price assessments. The AGAVE tool, developed by engineers at Kensho and Platts, has transformed the process for creating price assessments. Platts has implemented AGAVE in 40 of 57 markets targeted. And on average, daily price assessments are completed 70 minutes faster. Internally, Kensho Link facilitated quicker data ingestion by providing automated mappings for 60 million company entities. Externally, Kensho Link was used by our customers to efficiently map 16 million of their own entities to S&amp;P Global unique identifiers. Many of our customers have taken note of Kensho’s capabilities and we have begun monetizing Kensho Link, Kensho Scribe, RPA, data extraction and machine learning development. While the innovation we create internally is what drives much of our success, key industry trends also help. One of those is the shift into passive investing. This chart illustrates the $1.9 trillion of cumulative AUM U.S. equity flows in the past 10 years. We are a prime beneficiary of this trend. If we look at ETF AUM associated with our indices, there has been a 173% increase over the past 5 years to $2.8 trillion. We believe that this trend will continue. The increase in global issuance has been another positive trend for the company. It’s hard to believe that 2021 issuance growth of 15% exceeded 2020 issuance growth of 13% as is often the case to our pockets of strength and pockets of weakness. In 2020, global investment grade and high yield were the strongest, while in 2021 leveraged loans and structured products were the fastest growing categories. The market clearly favored leveraged loans over high yield in 2021. The bars on these charts depict leveraged loan volume which soared in 2021. The lines depict the percentage of loans that we rated, which reached new heights of 95% in the U.S. and 93% in Europe. I’d now like to shift the presentation to our outlook for 2022. The latest global refinancing study was issued earlier this month. The total amount of global debt maturing in this study is $11 trillion over the next 5 years. This is down 3% from the $11.3 trillion highlighted in last year’s study. The chart on the right depicts the global high yield debt and leveraged loans maturing over the next 5 years. It totals $2.9 trillion, down 3% from $3 trillion in last year’s study. It appears that 2021 issuance benefited from a bit of extra pull forward. Let’s put this small decline in upcoming maturities into perspective. This chart shows total global corporate debt outstanding for the past 6 years. This increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 6%. The vast majority of this debt will get refinanced, and the pool of debt that needs to be refinanced just keeps getting larger. After exceptional issuance growth in 2020 and 2021, our Ratings Research Group anticipates that issuance will decrease 2% in 2022. The forecast calls for gains in structured, U.S. municipal and financial services issuance of 3%, 2% and 1%, respectively and a decrease in non-financials of 7%. Please note that this is an issuance forecast not a revenue forecast and it does not include leveraged loans. Now, let’s start with the latest view from our economists. They are forecasting global GDP growth of 4.2% in 2022. The global economy is in the midst of a robust, but uneven rebound from the pandemic. Demand growth is outrunning supply growth and inflation has risen quickly almost everywhere. GDP growth in the U.S. and Europe reached multi-decade highs in 2021 and have continued in 2022. Inflation has proven to be more persistent than thought and now presents a key policy challenge in the U.S. and Europe. Our economists now expect at least 3 Fed rate hikes this year starting in March. Each year, we carefully assess the external factors facing the company. This slide depicts those that we think are most important going into 2022. Probably the most important positive factors are the expectation for continued healthy economic growth, borrowing costs that remain historically low, continued AUM flows from active to passive, elevated commodity levels that help the financial stability of commodity producers and ample liquidity. The most significant negative factors are geopolitical uncertainty, sticky inflation, Central Bank rate increases and a re-pricing of equities and of course, the pandemic and supply chain disruptions remain general risks facing the global economy. Before I finish, I want to say that I’m incredibly proud of the team we have built at S&amp;P Global and I look forward to welcoming the talented IHS Markit employees to S&amp;P Global. We are hopeful we will be speaking with you soon to update you on the merger. Once the merger is complete, we will immediately begin building a new company with an even brighter future. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout? Ewout Steenbergen Thank you, Doug and welcome to all of you on the call. Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Revenue increased 12%. Adjusted corporate unallocated expense increased 38% primarily due to increased incentive compensation, higher professional fees and the timing of contributions to the S&amp;P Global Foundation. Adjusted total expenses increased 9% and I will come back to this on the next slide. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 120 basis points. Interest expense decreased 22% primarily due to a reduction in FIN 48 interest expense accruals and adjusted diluted EPS increased 16%. Total adjusted expenses for the full year increased 7%. For the fourth quarter, they increased to 9%. The fourth quarter increase was primarily due to elevated variable expenses, including incentives, commissions and royalties as a result of strong 2021 financial performance; severance charges related to management changes in the Indices business during the quarter; increased investments in growth initiatives; increased professional fees; and the resumption of T&amp;E spending. During the fourth quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments totaled to a net pre-tax loss of $131 million. They included $21 million for merger transaction cost primarily legal fees, $42 million for merger integration cost primarily consulting fees, retention bonuses, branding and technology integration cost; $51 million from merger costs to achieve, which will drive synergy benefits, they include lease impairments and restructuring charges; $4 million for acquisition and divestiture-related expenses; $8 million in gains from real estate sales; and $21 million in deal-related amortization. This quarter, all four segments delivered increased revenue with Indices leading the way with an 18% increase. All four segments also delivered adjusted operating profit growth with Ratings leading the way with an 18% increase. Quarterly margins were mixed, but more importantly, all four segments reported a gain in adjusted operating profit margin for the year. Each year, on our fourth quarter earnings call, we share the changes in our headcount. In 2021, headcount decreased 1% primarily for two reasons. The first is operational efficiencies. Much of the operational efficiencies were from automation. In fact, our people created 225 bots in 2021 with Market Intelligence leading the way with 167 bots. Cognitive automation and RPA generated over 600,000 hours of savings in 2021. The second is pre-realized merger synergies. Because of the pending merger, it didn’t make sense to backfill many positions when people left the company in 2021. We estimate that there were about 150 S&amp;P Global positions left unfilled, representing pre-realized synergies of approximately $25 million by year end 2021. This year, with the formation of Sustainable1, we added this as a new category. Many of the people in Sustainable1 were previously reported in other categories. Platts was the area with the largest headcount increase at 11% due to investments in several growth projects. Market Intelligence had the largest decrease at 6% largely due to automation efficiencies and realignment to Sustainable1. Last year, we shared this slide and estimated that we would invest $100 million on growth initiatives in 2021. We ended up investing $80 million. The primary reasons for the difference were the competing priorities due to the merger and the competitive labor market. We will share our 2022 investment spending plans after the merger is completed. On our third quarter 2020 earnings call, we introduced a new $120 million productivity program to be completed over a 2 to 3-year period. I am pleased to report that only after 18 months we have already largely completed the program. There are few small procurement projects that are awaiting the close of the merger to take advantage of the increased scale of the combined company. All our productivity efforts will now be focused on achieving the merger synergies. Now, turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet continues to be very strong with low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 billion and debt of $4.1 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8x. Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $3.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $217 million or 7% over the prior year period. Because the share repurchase program was suspended due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, we only returned 21% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2021. After the merger is completed, we expect to significantly ramp up share repurchases. Now, let’s turn to the division results, starting with S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the segment delivered 18% revenue growth primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices and increased exchange-rated derivative activity. Our asset-linked revenue also included the benefit of a customer underreporting true-up. In the fourth quarter, we reported a 28% increase in adjusted expenses primarily due to severance, increased incentive compensation, commissions and royalties; a 13% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 65.7%, a decrease of 280 basis points. On a trailing four-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 80 basis points to 69.9%. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices delivered growth across all revenue channels this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 18% with very strong gains in ETFs and mutual funds. Exchange-traded derivative revenue increased 30%. Data and custom subscriptions increased 10%. Activity at the CBOE increased in the fourth quarter, with S&amp;P 500 Index options activity increasing 47% and fixed futures and options activity increasing 18%. CME equity complex volume increased 15% with particular strength in E-mini S&amp;P 500 options. Ratings reported revenue increased 12%. Adjusted expenses increased 5% primarily due to increased incentive compensation, wages and outside services. This resulted in an 18% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 300 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 180 basis points to 64.2%. Non-transaction revenue increased 7% primarily due to fees associated with CRISIL, new entity credit ratings and surveillance, partly offset by lower Rating Evaluation Service. As an aside, we added over 1,000 new entity credit ratings in 2021. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to strength in investment-grade corporate bonds, bank loans and structured products. This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was the 14% increase in corporates. In addition, financial services revenue increased 5%, structured finance increased 32%, governments decreased 11%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%. On the right side of this slide, you can see the changes in revenue within structured products. The largest change was in CLOs, which increased 43%. Turning to Platts, revenue increased 12% or $26 million, including a $4 million commercial settlement. Approximately 14% of this growth was from new products. Core subscriptions increased 10%, and Global Trading Services increased 13%. The gains in GTS revenue were mainly from higher petroleum and iron ore volumes. Adjusted expenses increased 16% primarily due to increased commissions, growth investments, cost of sales and incentives. Adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 50.1%. The trailing four-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 55.1%. Platts delivered excellent revenue growth in every category with notable increases in natural gas, power and renewables and petrochemicals. Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 8% or $42 million, with 34% of the growth coming from new products. Usage of our key market platforms increased 4% year-over-year, while year-ending active users increased 13% to 299,000 users. Adjusted expenses increased 5% due to increased cloud hosting initiatives, royalties, incentives and commissions. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 15%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 200 basis points to 32.7%. On a trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 34.3%. Looking across the Market Intelligence components, Desktop revenue grew 6%. During 2021, Market Intelligence rebranded its premier platform offering as Capital IQ Pro. The Capital IQ Pro platform combines the best of Capital IQ and SNL desktops with broad public fundamentals and deep industry data. In addition, the platform offers greater visibility into private companies and private markets as well as regulatory, supply chain, climate data and analytics and ESG scores. Data Management Solutions revenue grew 11%, and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 8%. Due to the pending merger, the company will not provide guidance for 2022 at this time but will provide 2022 guidance for the combined company after the merger is completed. We continue to expect the merger to close this quarter. In addition to the slides that we have reviewed on this call, there are additional slides in an appendix that can be downloaded from the Investor Presentations section of the Investor Relations website. In conclusion, 2021 was a noteworthy year for S&amp;P Global. We delivered strong financial results, realized significant growth, made considerable progress on merger preparation and synergy validation and launched multiple innovative new products across the company, including our Sustainable1 product offerings. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions. Chip Merritt Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Our first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong Hi, thanks. Good morning. With respect to the merger with IHS Markit, can you elaborate on what steps remain for the companies to complete before the transaction can close? Doug Peterson Hi, George, this is Doug. Thanks for the question. Well, first of all, as you know from our last call and what you’ve seen that we’ve released, we have approval from all of the regulators that we require approval from to close the merger. And – but those are conditioned on certain divestitures. So with the UK CMA, we are – have already presented them with approved buyers for the Base Chemicals business, which is News Corp. We’re waiting for their approval of that potential buyer. And then the second would be from the EC. We have – they have looked at all of the divestitures and the additional one from them is CUSIP, which we’ve announced that we signed a contract with FactSet. And we’re waiting for them to approve them as an acceptable divestiture partner. Other than that, we’re ready to go. George Tong Got it. Very helpful. You’ve realized pre-realized merger synergies over the course of 2021 and early 2022. Given your work around synergy realization, how are your views on revenue and cost synergies from the transaction changed? Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, George, this is Ewout. Obviously, we have continued to work on further validating our synergies, both on the cost side and on the revenue side. We have, in the meantime, had five rounds of synergy submissions by our work streams. So they do a lot of work on substantiating synergies, building bottom-up plans and further really developing concrete initiatives around these synergies. So the confidence level is going up for each of those submission rounds. I cannot give you specific numbers today. We will get back to you during the merger call. But a lot of work is continuing, so we’re ready to realize the synergies immediately after completing the transaction. George Tong Got it. Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, George. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan Thanks, so much. I wanted to ask on Ratings. You mentioned the down 2% issuance for this year that your Ratings Group is forecasting. Just given the potential for rising rates, you mentioned you’re expecting three rate hikes. I guess how are you thinking about upside versus downside to that down 2% number? Doug Peterson Yes, Toni, thank you for that. First of all, let me just share a little bit of the color of the market. As you know, last year was – had a lot of mixed movement in the Ratings. As an example, the corporates in the U.S. were down 30%. Financial institutions were up 17%, and then as an example, globally structured credit, which is CLOs, was up 265%. So we saw a lot of mix in the movements. And our analysts and the team at the S&amp;P Global Ratings research team have been looking across all of those types of factors, what was the part issuance. One thing that they have looked at is what was the growth in issuance over the last couple of years in all the different sectors? What’s the M&amp;A landscape? What are we seeing for the pipeline of LBOs, private sector transactions, private credit transactions? And what they see right now is in the – what we call the corporates or the industrials that they are expecting they’ll be down by about 7% next year with the range of negative 15% to negative 5%. Financial services relatively flat, up about 1% with a range from down 5% to up 5%. Structured finance at about 3% growth for the year with could go down as much as 5%, could go as much up as 8%. And then public finance at about 2%, either flat to up 5%. So that gives you a total of down about 2% with a range that could go down 8%, and it could go up to 3%. As I said, this is based on the factors of looking at the pipeline, looking at outstanding issuance, maturities that are coming up, M&amp;A pipeline, what we’ve learned from the banking sector on what they see with the private transactions, etcetera. Toni Kaplan That’s great. Very helpful. And wanted to ask on ESG, so you have mentioned in the past that most of the ESG revenue right now is in Platts, but there are significant opportunities in the other segments, and you’ve mentioned a number of those earlier in the call. But just how should we think about the ramp of ESG in the different segments? Like would you expect like Market Intelligence to be able to ramp first or Index? And should we see this being sort of a gradual opportunity over time? Or as things gain traction, massive step up somewhere? Just how should we think about going forward? Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Toni, if you look at the revenues for ESG, we’re very pleased with the growth during 2021. We realized 51% growth in revenues across the company. And so overall, we continue to be committed to that 40% CAGR that we have laid out before. Your question with respect to each of the segments, you’re right that Platts is still the highest, the largest in terms of ESG revenue contribution. Market Intelligence is very closely following now the Platts business. And what we are seeing that besides Platts, particularly Ratings, Market Intelligence and the Index business are having the highest growth of each ESG revenues at this point in time. So this is clearly an enterprise-wide initiative. That’s why we have created the Sustainable1 group that is looking across the company and driving commercial initiatives for the company as a whole. And we continue to be very excited about the outlook for the ESG revenues and particularly also seeing that growth in the other segments outside of Platts. Toni Kaplan Perfect. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Toni. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh Great. Thanks, so much and congratulations. Obviously, there is a lot going on and just really, really nice outcome. Doug or Ewout, could you talk about obviously, there is the focus on rates, but there is market volatility as well. Maybe talk about how the volatility impacts the Indices business, the Market Intelligence and then Platts as well because I think there is puts and takes across the model, but maybe the increased volatility, again, how that impacts Indices, Intelligence and then maybe just a spike in oil within the context of Platts, if you could. Ewout Steenbergen Absolutely, Kevin, and good morning. Actually, the way how we look at volatility, that is, in many cases, also a positive for our businesses because if there is more volatility going on in the markets, more activity happening. There is more demand for our products, for our research, for our insight and for our analytics. So actually, volatility in markets usually shows more the higher value add of our products. And then on top of that, we see two of our businesses that are directly benefiting from more volatility from a trading perspective. We have Global Trading Services revenue in Platts that is going up when there is more market volatility in the commodities markets. And then we have the exchange-traded derivative activity in the Index business, which is the case that there is more hedging going on been in more volatile equity markets. And that is one of the revenue drivers of our Index business. So clearly, volatility is helping the company both from a value add, but then also about directly two revenue streams in both the Index and the Platts business. Kevin McVeigh That’s great. I will get back in, thank you so much. Ewout Steenbergen Thank you, Kevin. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm Hi, good morning, everyone. Wanted to come back to the Ratings agency discussion for a second, Doug, you mentioned obviously that the forecast from your team doesn’t include loan markets. But if you look at the loan business for you in 2021, obviously, that business doubled. So, curious where you shake out in terms of loan market expectations in terms of issuance? And obviously, that filters into structured finance as well in case it’s a soft environment, which we’ve seen so far in January. Thank you. Doug Peterson Yes. Thank you. Well, when it comes to the loan market, we still see conditions which are quite attractive for loan issuers. First of all, even though there is discussions about rates going up, we’ve seen estimates from 3, 4, 5, 6, even 7 hikes recently as the last couple of days, our own economists have increased their expectation for rate hikes in the U.S. up to a range of more like 5 or 6 now. But even if you look at rates, rates are still quite low. And there is a lot of demand for floating rate instruments given the rate cycle, and there could be increases there. We also see a very strong M&amp;A pipeline. As you know, M&amp;A is one of the biggest drivers of loan issuance as people complete M&amp;A, they many times are financing it with a bridge loan or potentially going into the loan market. So when we look at the entire market, we think that even though rates are going to be going up, they are still low on historical levels. Spreads are very tight. There is a lot of demand for floating rate paper. There is a large pipeline of transactions coming through, both from a combination of M&amp;A as well as private equity transactions. So we’re seeing right now still a very strong market for loans into the near future. Alex Kramm Alright. Fair enough. And then maybe this could be for Ewout or you. Inflation, obviously, is a topic that’s been coming up a lot. Curious, I know you’re not giving any guidance at this point, but how you think, on the one hand, that could impact your cost pressure that we’ve seen with other companies? And then maybe remind us how much CPI you have built into some of your contracts in Market Intelligence, maybe Platts. So I guess the question is where could inflation actually help organic growth in 2022, which some people may not be thinking about? Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Alex. I’m going to start, and then I’m going to hand it over to Ewout. Well, first of all, when we look at inflation, we see that last year, as an example, in the U.S., it was a 7% annualized rate in December. That annualized rate of 7% has, obviously, led to a very animated discussion about interest rates in the U.S. So as we built our plan and we’re looking forward, we’ve been looking at this in the U.S. and the UK, around the world. So first impact is we believe that interest rates will be going up. You’ve seen them go up in the UK. They are talking about it in the EC. The ECB has now been rumored to be looking at interest rate increases. And then in the U.S., there is expectations this year. So we’ve built those factors in. When it comes to labor markets, that’s one of the areas I am watching myself quitter closely both from a systemic point of view and then for our company itself. We’ve seen some wage pressure in areas like technology roles. There are some ESG roles that we’ve seen some pressure, wage pressure because those – we’re obviously going to be paying market rates. But let me hand it over to Ewout to give you some more thoughts about how we’re applying it for our budget for this year. Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Alex, if we think about the impact of inflation on the company, we think, overall, this is going to be manageable for us because of a couple of reasons. Obviously, there will be expense increases with respect to people costs and procurement. And as Doug said, we are making some targeted adjustments for certain job groups within the company. But then the offsets are the following. We are continuing to run productivity programs, and you have seen that we have made quite good progress with the program we announced in 2020. Of course, we’re getting the significant synergy programs. And then we have an opportunity based on the high value-add of our products and services to achieve more favorable contract terms and fees over time when we are at that point of renewal. Obviously, that depends on facts and circumstances for each of our businesses. But clearly, we will be looking at balancing growth, at margins, at customer relations and then ultimately, shareholder value by managing the impact of inflation. But as I said at the beginning, we think that is overall manageable from a financial results perspective. Alex Kramm Very helpful. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Alex. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the – when the INFO acquisition was announced, the company had guided to a mid-single-digit EPS growth for ‘22. I understand, you will provide the guidance on the – after the acquisition closes. But a lot has changed since then. So I was just wondering if you could just provide us some puts and takes since the original guidance was given and whether the buyback was included in that original guidance? Any incremental color will be helpful. Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen Ashish, fully understand this is a very unusual situation that we cannot provide you guidance at this point in time. Having said that, you should expect us from a philosophical perspective, how we manage the company to continue exactly for what you have seen us doing in the past and what we have thought you before. So expect to grow revenues in all of our businesses in 2022 and also to continue to expand our margins. And we will be more specific during the merger call and give you more quantification around that. Ashish Sabadra That’s very helpful color, thank you for that. And then just on the multiyear productivity, it’s great to see the progress there and ability to pull forward or ability to execute at a better-than-expected pace and then now the focus on cost synergies going forward. Just a question there would be is there opportunity for – as we – in addition to the cost synergies, could there be more opportunities for productivity, global productivity improvement on stand-alone businesses as well? Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen We will continue to look at all the opportunities. You may expect us to see us continue to be very disciplined from a cost management perspective. There are areas where we are further looking at across the whole company from productivity to real estate to automation, many, many different areas. Again, we will give you a full update on what that means for the combined company from a synergy perspective. But overall, I’m very pleased with the progress we are making to get ready to start to realize those synergies and the concrete plans that we have put behind that. And as I said before, five rounds we now had in terms of synergies, submissions by the work streams. So an incredible amount of work has gone into this to further validate and to bring up the confidence level in terms of what we will be able to accomplish. Ashish Sabadra That’s great and congrats on such a strong quarter. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Ashish. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik Thank you. I’m just looking at the Kensho slide here, and I just wanted kind of a high-level overview on what the pipeline at Kensho looks like just with S&amp;P at the moment, and I imagine IHS Markit only opens up the doors there? Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Manav. And you know this is always one of my favorite topics to talk about. So we continue to be so excited about the initiatives of Kensho and how Kensho is helping to transform S&amp;P Global and what it can do also for the combined company after we complete the transaction. You’ve seen some of the highlights of the accomplishment of Kensho during 2021, and we are expecting to see that continuing in 2022. We have such a complete toolkit of AI for unstructured data, which is about linking data, extraction, speech to text, the Codex platform that is now on Cap IQ Pro and has already 300,000 users to date. And you cannot imagine the amount of demand that Kensho have going forward. We will have some prioritization decisions to make where we think we can create the highest value and where to use those resources. Also, by the way, the attention for Kensho from external customers is going up at this point in time. There is more and more external activity happening and also the relations with Kensho with some of the large technology firms is further expanding. So we’re actually really excited that the external recognition of Kensho remains very high. So high value creation for Kensho, and it’s going to be really positive to see what is going to be next for Kensho in a way to help to catalyze innovation for the company. Manav Patnaik Got it, thank you for that. And then just a quick update on China, obviously, the number of ratings is growing really nicely as you disclosed. Just wondering like is the revenue material yet and what that kind of pace looks like? Doug Peterson Yes. Thanks, Manav. Well, we’re so excited about China. We have a fantastic team there with really good leadership. We’ve been out educating the market. As you know, there is been some opportunities for us to provide some seminars on credit. We’ve seen a very large increase in traffic coming to us, especially given the current credit environment in China. As you mentioned, we got up to 57 ratings in 2021. One of the things that’s important to us is that they span the different levels of investment-grade ratings. They are broad from AAA to BBB. We rated financial institutions, corporate structured. And the regulatory environment is also one where there are some very good initiatives going on to look at changing the floor of ratings that are going to be available for financial institutions and insurance companies. But our revenue is still light. It’s not material to the company. It’s something that we’re putting a major focus on in 2022, so we can drive our commercial organization faster and harder to take advantage of the really strong start that we’re off to. Manav Patnaik Alright. Thank you very much. Doug Peterson Thanks, Manav. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari Hi. Good morning. Thank you. My question is just on market intelligence. Could you just remind us are all those contracts now on enterprise-wide arrangements? And maybe do you see the mix changing with data management solutions kind of being a much bigger part? And any mix changes you see within this business post merger? I know it’s one of your highest growth businesses and margins seem to have come back post some of your earlier investments. Ewout Steenbergen Hamzah, good morning. Definitely what we expect to see is that the data management solutions is going to grow faster and becoming a more and more prominent part of the market intelligence business over time. So, maybe going back to a couple of the comments you made. With respect to enterprise-wide contracts, that process is done. So, we have now all our contracts on that basis. What you are seeing is very steady and healthy growth in desktop. We really like the commercial activity in 2021. We have seen some very healthy sales levels, and that sets us up well for 2022 from a desktop growth perspective, 6% reported growth. And that is more or less that mid-single digit steady growth is to be expected going forward. Then data management solutions in a normal quarter, you should see that grow at high-single digits to low-teens. We are a bit higher this quarter, about 11% and particularly nice growth in marketplace and in the Trucost area as well. So, those are doing particularly very well. And then lastly, you were referring to margins. We have been investing, as you know, the last year a lot in new growth initiatives in market intelligence. And we are very happy to see that paying off from an overall revenue growth perspective. And we said that you should see margins coming back in 2021 to that mid-30 levels. And we are very happy to see that, that actually also has taken place. So, market intelligence is very well positioned, I think for the next few years. Hamzah Mazari Got it. Very helpful. And just my follow-up question, I will turn it over, is just around just the ratings business. I know you highlighted your global issuance forecast for 2022. And I know your revenue differs obviously with that figure because of pricing and non-transactional business and mix, etcetera. But maybe could you talk about what you are seeing in Europe around issuance, maybe in Asia? I know you touched on China in some of your prepared remarks, but any thoughts as to outside of North America, how those markets look like as you look at 2022? Thank you. Doug Peterson Yes. Just to give you some thoughts about the markets. Well, first of all, the numbers we gave you were a global issuance forecast, so it’s taken into account all the different markets we are in. But Europe was very similar to the United States last year in full year and also in the final numbers in the quarter. Europe was down in corporates, but it was up in financial institutions as well as very strong in CLOs and structured credit. In addition, the CMBS market in Europe was strong. We saw – it’s not a big market, but there was a lot of interest in CMBS in the European market. We see the continued conditions in Europe that are strong for capital markets. There is an interest. I have mentioned this before in other calls, in the European policy sector to stop having all of the dependence for corporate financing coming from banks and moving more to capital markets. As that continues, we see that as a long-term valuable trend for us. That trend in Asia is also something that we are seeing more of as well. Just a little bit about 2020 – 2021. In Asia, across all of Asia, both the corporates and financial institutions were up. Corporates were up about 10%, and financial institutions were up about 14% through the year, whereas the overall structure in Asia was only up about 30%, most of that being in traditional ABS and RMBS where the major volume is. But we do see, again, in Asia that move towards capital markets away from banking markets as a trend. There is also a lot more M&amp;A activity taking place and part of Asia, obviously, is China where we are on the ground floor there as that becomes a much more sophisticated market. Hamzah Mazari Got it. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Hamzah. Operator Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open. Craig Huber Great. Thank you. Just wanted to touch on the cost a little bit for the – you gave some good detail earlier on this. But in the fourth quarter, can you just touch on internal investment spending, how that may have differed dollar-wise if you could versus a year ago or sequentially and also incentive compensation as well. Is that materially different? How is it accrued over the course of the year? And I have a follow-up. Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Yes. Good morning Craig, and thanks for asking that question. So I would first would like to point out that the expenses are unusually high during this quarter. The vast majority is not recurring, and you should see continued expense discipline from us going forward. So, having said that, you were specifically asking about certain categories, so, what you are seeing were from an expense growth perspective that the majority of the growth was coming from variable expenses, performance-related expenses, which I consider good expenses because they are directly correlated with healthy sales and revenue activity. So, these are commissions, royalties and incentive compensation. Incentive compensation, you asked a specific question around that. We are accruing at this moment significantly above 100% for our short-term incentive compensation, and that’s a bit higher compared to 2020. And also the performance factors of our long-term incentive compensation are running a bit higher than in 2020. So, that drove some of the additional expenses. With respect to growth investments, although you saw that they were overall a bit lower compared to the year before, that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have an impact on the overall expense levels, because some of those growth initiatives go to a baseline. And it means that some of the new growth initiatives are still incremental to what we already have in place. So overall, growth in net investments drove approximately $15 million of the expense growth during the fourth quarter. So, we think these are clear reasons why the expense growth is happening. The underlying recurring expense growth is actually very limited and very minimal. Craig Huber And my follow-up, I guess, you guys touched on a little bit earlier about on bank loans, the outlook for that. Can you just go a little bit deeper? I mean that’s obviously a huge wildcard this year. Obviously, it’s not included in your global debt issuance forecast. So, maybe touch on a little deeper what do you think the likely outcomes are for bank loans versus last year’s strength of about 100%? Maybe touch on CLOs as well as they think about this New Year. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Craig. Yes. Right now, I can talk to you a little bit about the conditions, but we are not giving any guidance right now for 2022. But as I mentioned, the conditions for the market as of the current market are still quite favorable for bank loans. In particular, the M&amp;A market, we see is strong. There is a large backlog of transactions which have already been announced that haven’t been closed yet. You have a large private equity pipeline of transactions, which are going on. Even though interest rates are starting to go up, and we have seen the 10-year treasury hasn’t hit 2%, but it’s getting closer. But spreads are tight, and interest rates are still very low on a historical basis. There is a lot of demand as well from insurance companies, from banks and other institutional investors for floating rate paper. So, we do think that the conditions are still very strong for the loan market. But as of now, we are not giving any specific guidance for 2022. Craig Huber Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Craig. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open. Trevor Romeo Hi, good morning. This is actually Trevor Romeo in for Andrew. I appreciate you taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones for me. First, just wanted to go a bit deeper on Platts with 12% growth in the quarter, I think 18% growth in the U.S. I know some of that might be one-time from the commercial settlement. Is there anything you would call out there in terms of drivers of that strength? And how much is the strong commodity market driving growth kind of across the various areas of Platts right now? Ewout Steenbergen Good morning Trevor, definitely very pleased to see such a high revenue growth in Platts. I think it has been a long time ago, we see Platts growing in the double-digit space. So, this is really excellent results. You are right, there was that $4 million commercial settlement in those numbers. If you would take that out, you are at approximately 10% growth for revenues for Platts in the fourth quarter, so still quite strong. So, what is happening behind there in terms of revenue growth, we see strong commercial momentum in both the core business, which is the price reporting business and the insights business. And that is mostly because we see customers being healthy with the current commodity prices. The current commodity market environment is actually very good for our customers and then also global trading services is doing well. We are growing clearly here based on the overall price volatility in the markets. And then the third reason behind this strong revenue growth of Platts is the new initiatives. We have invested in new initiatives like LNG, energy transition and agriculture, and they also start to pay off at this moment, so very pleased with the results of Platts overall. Trevor Romeo Great. Great. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, just wanted to ask about your recent acquisition of the Climate Service, I am sure that’s probably a fairly small acquisition, but just wondering if you could talk a bit more about how that kind of physical climate risk more broadly fits into your ESG strategy? Thank you. Doug Peterson Yes. Thank you for that. The Climate Service is a really interesting business, and it’s an excellent fit for us with the suite of climate products, in particular, that we have been putting together, both homegrown as well as the Trucost acquisition we made 4.5 years ago. It brings a platform called Climanomics, which is you are able to build across different data sets. It allows companies to look at their physical risk in many different categories, cyclones, hurricanes, fire, floods, etcetera. And it can be modeled to different approaches. As an example, the task force for climate-related financial disclosure modeling. So, this is something that we find that it’s a great fit for our organization. But more importantly, it also brings a really talented group of people, people who are entrepreneurial. They have got passion. They have got energy. And they are going to be a great addition to S&amp;P Global as well because they are going to bring all of that energy as we build out even further our Sustainable1 business platform. Trevor Romeo Great. I appreciate the color. Thanks again. Doug Peterson Yes. Thanks, Trevor. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Owen Lau Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I want to get your thought about the potential development of ESG this year. And there has been a lot of conversation about the inconsistency of ESG data and ratings, and there are obviously some benefits of ESG data as well. But could you please talk about some of the potential events or development this year that can potentially get us closer to a more standardized ESG disclosure or ESG data and ratings? Thank you. Doug Peterson Yes. Thanks, Owen. This is really an important area for us, both as S&amp;P Global as well as an industry. And by that, I mean, the entire financial industry as we look to this important factor that starts to get included in people’s decision-making. What we see is that the ESG market itself for data and analytics as scores, it started to evolve as more and more insurance companies, institutional investors, asset managers take those factors into account as they make decisions. And as of now, as you know, the factors which are being used by different organizations are not the same. You have organizations that care more about climate. You have some that care more about diversity inclusion or supply chain. And so there is different language out there, whether it’s an impact fund, it’s an ESG fund, it’s an ESG approach. And we are working very closely with different organizations such as the IFRS and the ISSP. They are setting up the international sustainability standards for disclosure. The IOSCO, which is the International Organization of Securities, Commissioners, is looking at new rules around the globe for disclosure as well, both disclosure from the point of view of issuers, but also disclosure that could be asked for by different types of investors as they sell their funds or sell their investments. We do think that there is a really good effort going on across the private sector as well as NGOs along with these regulatory agencies to start addressing what would be the potential regulatory requests as well as the market themselves coming to standards of how we are going to be disclosing this. S&amp;P Global for our products, all of our products, we provide very simple, clear, consistent disclosure on everything that we are providing in the ESG products. Our disclosure is built in a way that it’s consistent, it’s transparent, it’s comparable. You can see what the actual criteria is that’s used to determine an index or a score or the weighting of the score. And we think that, that’s going to be a key differentiating factor for us as we build out our ESG business. Owen Lau Got it. That’s very helpful. And then one follow-up question is about the buyback. And again, and I know you don’t provide any specific guidance on buyback, but how should we think about kind of the magnitude and also the timing of the ASR? I mean, the stocks have traded down quite a bit since the beginning of this year. Would you be opportunistic to do one large ASR or you would do multiple ASR for the rest of this year? Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Owen, let me explain to you philosophically what we are having in mind. Obviously, we need to do a catch-up because we have not been able to do buybacks over the last 2 years. The same applies for IHS Markit. We have the opportunity to do buybacks based on the proceeds of some of those divestitures. We are also, of course, looking at the overall refinancing that we can do of the IHS Markit debt and potentially some opportunity for upsizing. And then very quickly, we would like to go in a normal course return of capital. We still are committed to the capital targets that were provided the call when we announced the merger, so at least 85% of return of free cash flow. So, we definitely are ready to resume buybacks after the transaction is completed and we would like to do that as quickly as possible in order to get normal rating again for the combined company. Owen Lau Got it. Thank you very much. Doug Peterson Thanks Owen. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Silber Thanks. I know it’s late. I will just ask one. In your comments, you talked a bit about labor cost. I was wondering if you can drill down a little bit more. First of all, is it more difficult to find and retain people? I know a lot of companies are talking about that? And then what does that translate into the labor costs you have been incurring and what you expect for this year? Thanks. Doug Peterson Thanks, Jeff. I am going to start and then hand it over to Ewout. As I mentioned earlier, it’s critical for us that we are competitive, and we are paying market rates in all of the different markets we are in. We are seeing a little bit of inflation or increase in job expenses, wage expenses, as I mentioned, in some specific areas like high-demand technology areas, data scientists. One market, in particular, we are seeing increase in some pressures in India. And I will give you an example of something you might not have thought of, but we are actually seeing a lot of our recruiters getting recruited away. People are trying to hire people who can hire people. So, we are seeing certain areas where we do see some increase in turnover, and we are seeing clearly the areas that we are watching quite carefully. But our philosophy is to pay market rates to ensure that this is a great place to work, and Ewout can talk a little bit more of how that translates. Ewout Steenbergen Yes. In addition to what Doug said, I think we are not having any problem with hiring. We are still a very attractive company, people like to work for us. And to stay competitively from a pay perspective, we have made adjustments for certain job groups. Think about the ratings analysts, technology and ESG. And we are also increasing the merit levels in certain jurisdictions. So, that is just to make sure we stay competitive. But overall, as I said to an earlier question, we believe that the impact is manageable because we have opportunities also to look at productivity, synergy, efficiencies, automation as well as the opportunity to look at some contractual terms and fees over time. Jeff Silber Okay. That’s very helpful. Thanks so much. Doug Peterson Thanks, Jeff. Operator Thank you. Our final question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open. Jeff Meuler Yes. Thank you. I heard you a lot and clear, no guidance at this time. But I thought Ewout said that you expect to grow revenue in all of your businesses in ‘22. If I could just confirm if that’s what was said, obviously, asking specifically for ratings, if that’s the case. And then a related technical question, just given your team – your ratings team maintaining the down two issuance forecast, but also explicitly saying risks way to the downside. Did they lower the low end of the range and that down eight, seven at the low end already reflects their current views of that downside risk, or did they maintain the whole range and their kind of probability weighting different parts of the range or think there could be a future adjustment? Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Good morning Jeff. First, to your question about revenue growth, indeed, I said before that we expect to grow revenues in all of our businesses in 2022 and that we will get back to you with more specifics during the merger call. With respect to your question about some of the ranges with respect to the issuance forecast by our research group, I think you are right that compared to a quarter ago, some of the ranges have widened. But overall, the issuance forecast is still at a minus 2% level. And ranges have become wider because as we showed you in one of those slides in the prepared remarks, clearly, there is more uncertainty in the macro environment. So, the level of headwinds and potential tailwinds that we are seeing is a bit larger. So, ranges are wider, but overall, the midpoint is still the same. Jeff Meuler Makes sense. Thanks for the reinforcement. Thank you. Doug Peterson Yes. Thanks, Jeff. And let me just reinforce what Ewout said about the businesses and just clarify that this is S&amp;P Global businesses that we are talking about. We have no discussion whatsoever about the IHS Markit businesses. But let me wrap up the call. And I want to thank everyone again for joining the call for your questions, for your support. I want to thank, again, as I always do, our very dedicated people. This has now been 2 years for the pandemic. We are going into our third year. We have asked our people to do a lot last year in the last 2 years. And we want to ensure that they are fully prepared for the expected merger with IHS Markit because we are going to be working really hard and running fast as soon as that closes. And throughout 2021, we continued to perform, as you saw today, with the strong financial results and the progress on our strategic initiatives, especially those that are going to be driving growth in the future and Kensho, data sciences, data analytics, ESG, what we have talked about with investment in our global businesses. Going back to one of the first questions we received about the merger. We are very excited about the merger and the progress that we have been making, planning for the merger. We are going to host the call as soon as it’s completed. We will do a post-merger investor call. We can provide an update on the company’s strategy, the business segments, the synergies, the investment program, share repurchases, things that you asked about today or wanted to ask about today, and that would include guidance. One last point I would like to make on the call is I want to thank Chip Merritt. He has been an incredible partner as our Head of IR. He is going to still be with us for a few more months until May. But for the past 9 years, he has been a great partner. He has helped position S&amp;P Global as the leading financial data and analytics and benchmark company and always with a great sense of humor. So Chip, thank you so much for your partnership throughout. We couldn’t have never done as well as we had without you. So again, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. We are very proud of all that we have been able to achieve, but we also have a lot to look forward to. So, thank you, again, everyone. Operator That concludes this morning’s call. A PDF version of the presentation slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in two hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&amp;P Global’s website for 1 year. The audio-only telephone replay will be maintained for one month.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug? Doug Peterson Thank you, Chip. Welcome to today's third quarter Earnings Call. I'd like to start with some of the highlights of the quarter. We reported exceptional financial results with revenue increasing 13%, and all 4 businesses delivering strong revenue and adjusted operating profit growth. Indices delivered the strongest revenue growth for the second straight quarter due to large gains in ETF AUM. Adjusted expenses increased 7%, largely due to investment spending, commissions, and royalties.  After raising guidance on both the first quarter and second quarter earnings calls, we're raising 2021 guidance again, based on these strong results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Ewout will provide details in a moment. I'd also like to share some additional highlights from the third quarter. The most important initiative of the year continues to be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit.  This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our Company and our customers. The regulatory path to closing the merger's now becoming clear. We launched S&amp;P Capital IQ Pro and Platts Dimensions Pro. And sustainable one, our ESG business is gaining momentum as we build internal capabilities and product offerings expand. I'll come back to all of these highlights in more detail, but let's start with the merger.  When we announced the merger November 2020, we noted that we needed regulatory approval in five jurisdictions, Canada, the European Union, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We've made substantial progress with all these regulators and there are number of remedies we must undertake in order to complete the merger. IHS Markit must divest the OPIS, the Coal, Metals and Mining, and the Petchem Wire businesses. The sale of these assets to News Corp has already been announced. In addition, IHS Markit must divest its Base Chemicals business. S&amp;P Global must divest CUSIP Global Services, and leverage commentary and data together with related family of leveraged loan indices. S&amp;P Global and IHS Markit will begin the process of selling these additional businesses shortly. In order to provide time to undertake these sales processes, we now expect to close the merger in the first quarter of 2022.  Collectively, the revenue from all of the businesses being divested is approximately $425 million, and the margins for each of these businesses are higher than the margins for each of the divisions they're in. In a moment, EVA will provide an update on our merger synergy expectations, and you will see that despite these divestitures, we're raising both our cost and revenue synergy targets. To recap the financial results for the third quarter, revenue increased 13% to $2.1 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 18% and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 250 basis points to 55.4%. As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on a trailing four quarter basis, which increased 130 basis points to 55.1%. As a result, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 24%.  Each quarter, we highlight a few key business drivers and important projects underway. This quarter, let's start with ratings bond issuance trends. During the third quarter, global bond issuance increased 3%. In the U.S., bond issuance in Aggregate increased 6% as Investment Grade decreased 12%, High Yield decreased 16%, Public Finance decreased 24%, while Structured Finance increased 105% due to large increases in every category, particularly CLOs which increased 340%.  European bond issuance increased 4% as Investment-grade decreased 7%, high yield decreased 4%, and structured finance increased 70% with gains in every asset class, except RMBS. Of particular note, CMBS increased 375%. In Asia, bond issuance decreased 2% overall. The data on this slide only depicts bond issuance when we include new bank loan volumes, overall global issuance increased 9%. The next two slides look at the combined high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume for the U.S. and Europe. Data is not readily available for the rest of the world. This slide shows that the combination of global leveraged loan and high yield issuance in the third quarter, continued to be very strong, surpassing every quarter in 2018. '19, and '20. This slide depicts the combination of high yield issuance and leveraged loan volume by the use of proceeds of the funds raised. This quarter, both general corporate purpose and refinancing-related issuance was lower than the third quarter of 2020. The surge in activity is entirely due to M&amp;A, LBOs, buybacks, and dividends. These are opportunistic categories that aren't pull-forward. The surge in issuance is not pulling forward issuance from future years, and it's additive to future financing needs. Since bank loan ratings are an important element of ratings revenue, we like to disclose our bank loan ratings revenue each quarter.  The unprecedented strength of bank loan ratings revenue continued in the third quarter, and year-to-date revenues already surpassed any of the previous 10 full years. The leverage loan market and the CLO market are dependent on one another as many of the leverage loans end up CLOs. As you can see here, CLO issuance continued to accelerate in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we rebranded our market intelligence platform as S&amp;P Capital IQ Pro. This recognizes the value of the Capital IQ brand as we continue to upgrade the platform with additional content and functionality. We currently have approximately 290,000 active desktop users of which 90,000 are utilizing S&amp;P Capital IQ Pro.  The inaugural release of S&amp;P Capital IQ Pro includes a number of capabilities not found in the market intelligence platform. A new Kensho -enabled document viewer incorporates AI -based search to speed up users' discovery of tech space insights across filings in transcripts. It's based on technology that Kensho originally developed for U.S. security and military agencies, and is now re-engineered for S&amp;P Capital IQ Pro. For example, it gives investors the ability to quickly screen comments made over years of earnings calls within minutes. The new platform features frequent coverage of private markets, including data around fundraising trends, dry powder, fund performance, and LP Investor allocations.  Also included is the ability for users to screen on non-traditional industry criteria, such as crypto, therapeutics and cleantech. S&amp;P Capital IQ Pro also includes ratings, direct coverage of corporate and financial institutions. Our users can now incorporate a full suite of S&amp;P Capital IQ pro tools and functionality and interact with S&amp;P Global ratings content in ways not previously possible. Platts has been on a long journey to consolidate its product platforms as well. With the acquisitions of Bentek, Eclipse [Indiscernible], Petromedia, and others. There has been a tremendous effort to consolidate all of these capabilities into a single platform.  This quarter, Platts introduced Platts Dimensions Pro, which provides users with a seamless one-stop shop experience across Platt's benchmark price assessments, news, and analytics, spanning 13 commodities, including energy transition. And like S&amp;P Capital IQ Pro, this content is available on a web-based portal that is mobile-friendly, via machine-to-machine delivery, and as an Excel add-in. Periodically, we like to provide updates on new product launches. The first 2 charts on this slide depict the acceptance by market participants of our JKM marker for liquefied natural gas and our low sulfur marine fuel assessment.  Both have exhibited very strong growth recently. The chart on the right shows the cumulative number of new assessments we have launched in energy transition space in the last 4 years. These include a new suite of Australian hydrogen prices, covering what is expected to be one of the key producers of this future fuel. The methane performance certificate, which reflects production of natural gas in the U.S., with 0 methane emissions, and upstream values for the measured carbon emissions associated with crude oil production and transportation, covering an initial suite of 14 crudes from around the world and aiming to provide the backbone for low carbon crude trading.  Buyers can start to make active choices based on the relative carbon impact of different crude sources with this crude carbon intensity product. Turning to our investments in ESG, our Sustainable1 milestones and product launches continue to build. Third quarter Sustainable1 revenue increased 58% to $24 million versus the prior period. With the launch of Second-Party Opinions, Ratings now has 5 products. Overall, Ratings completed, 10 ESG evaluations, 13 Green evaluations, 13 SIEM benchmark engagements, and 11 social and sustainability framework alignment opinions in the quarter. In market intelligence, we're close to wrapping up the annual CSA survey.  And so far in 2021, corporate participation increased 34% over 1,800 companies. On the back of these surveys, we relaunched our S&amp;P Global ESG scores on 8,000 companies during the quarter. We are targeting to have scores on more than 11,000 companies by the end of this year's assessment cycle in the first quarter of 2022. In indices, we had $26.5 billion of ESG ETF AUM at the end of the third quarter. This is an increase of 178% since the end of the third quarter of last year. Our indices business also added to its ESG indices offerings with the launch of the S&amp;P NZX 50 tilted index with the New Zealand Stock Exchange. Platts added products to both its suite of carbon assessments and it's recycled plastic offerings.  And finally, S&amp;P Global's a founding member of [Indiscernible], a new technology platform designed to provide private equity firms and the private markets with ESG measurement, data collection, and bench marking capabilities to help improve the management and tracking of ESG performance. By providing rich, detailed data on a wide array of ESG topics. The corporate sustainability assessment is an integral part of our ESG scores. Since we purchased the capability for RobecoSAM in late 2019, we've expanded the number of corporate participants by about 500 Companies, and the group has almost doubled corporate participation in the last 4 years.  Today's participating companies represents 45% of global market capitalization. In addition, you could see this as a global endeavor. We view the CSA input as a key differentiator to our Sustainable1 efforts. Let me now turn to our outlook for global issuance in GDP. The 2021 issuance forecast continued to creep higher, and is now relatively flat versus 2020 issuance. The latest forecast was issued earlier this week and also covers 2022 issuance for the first time. 2022 issuances forecast a declined 2%. This is based on a 7% decrease in Non-financial Corporate, a 1% increase in Financial Services, a 3% increase in Structured Finance, and a 2% increase in U.S. Public Finance. Looking forward, inflation concerns, prospects for rising rates, high cash balances, and possible tax reform, all translate to headwinds for issuance in 2022.  We expect that they will lead to a second year of contraction in issuance total. Please note that this is a bond issuance forecast. This is not a revenue forecast. For example, it doesn't address non-transaction revenue and doesn't include leveraged loan activity. The macro outlook is little change from 3 months ago. Our economists expect growth to moderate in 2022 with growth in Europe and many emerging markets improving while growth rates drop in the US and China.  Commodity prices have rebound due to strong retail sales, weather events in supply chain and balances. However, inflation pressures appear to be peaking with some emerging markets Central Banks raising rates, US Federal Reserve moving up its tapering timeline, and the ECB firmly on hold for now. Finally, Platts Analytics believes the current fundamentals should remain supportive of oil prices in the mid 70s. This is positive for the health of the oil industry. I will now turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout? Ewout Steenbergen Thank you, Doug. While we have excellent Third Quarter results and an exciting merger pending, I would like to start my discussion today with our latest thinking around our merger synergy targets. There that has been an extensive effort throughout the Company to identify and validate potential merger synergies. While the initial synergy targets that we introduced at the time of the merger announcement were developed by a very limited number of senior managers, the latest figures take into consideration in depth planning and analysis by countless employees across both companies. We have increased our total synergy targets and now estimate that there will be $530-580 million of cost synergies and $330-360 million of revenue synergies. As you can see in the slide, these stakes into consideration new synergies identified as well as those who will no longer be able to achieve due to required divestitures.  Correspondingly, the proceeds of the divestitures will contribute to additional capacity for share repurchases. I'll also want to point out that on a run rate basis, we have already achieved approximately $25 million of these synergies. This is primarily from not back-filling open positions created through normal attrition. Today, we are only providing an update on the merger synergy targets. We'll give you a full update on the financial targets of the merged Company after we complete the transaction.  Turning to our third quarter financial results, Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. Adjusted corporate unallocated expenses increased 18% due to Company-owned life insurance proceeds in the prior period. Our net interest expense improved 13% due to the refinancing of a substantial portion of our debt last year. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to a refinement of tax accruals on foreign operations related to both a prior and current period. During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.02.  The only meaningful impact was in ratings where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $5 million. In the Second Quarter, we introduced three new categories to provide insights into the type of expenses that are going to be incurred related to the pending merger. The first category is transaction costs. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees, and filing fees. The second category is integration costs. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure, and retention costs. The third category is cost to achieve.  These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees, and investments related to product development, marketing, and distribution enhancements. During the third quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments collectively totaled to a net pretax loss of $73 million. They included $9 million from merchant transaction costs, primarily legal fees, $45 million for merger integration costs, primarily consulting fees, a $3 million gain on the sale of an office building in India, and $21 million in deal-related amortization.  This quarter, all 4 deficient delivered solid gains in revenue and adjusted operating profit, with indices delivering the largest gains. On a trading four-quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased in all 4 deficient with indices leading with a gain of 170 basis points. I'll provide color on the individual business results in a moment. Now, turning to the Balance Sheet, our Balance Sheet continues to be very strong with low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion and debt of $4.1 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8 times.  Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $2.6 billion in the first nine months of 2021, an increase of more than $300 million or 15% over the prior year period. Due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, share repurchases have been suspended. Now let's turn to the deficient results and begin with S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which delivered extraordinary revenue growth of 28% primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices. Please note that the ETF revenue included a $5 million break-up fee due to the termination of our indices as the basis for several ETFs.  In the third quarter, adjusted expenses increased 4% largely due to royalties and compensation partially offset by reduced legal costs. The adjusted segment operating profit increased a whopping 40% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 660 basis points to 71.8%. On a trailing four-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 170 basis points to 70.7%. Every category increased revenue this quarter, asset-linked fees increased 36% primarily from gains in ETF s, augmented by gains in mutual function insurance and over-the-counter derivative activity that exceeded 20%.  Exchange traded derivative revenue increased 15% on increased trading volumes at the [Indiscernible]. Data and custom subscriptions increased 8%. For our indices deficient over the past year, ETF net inflows were $223 billion and market appreciation totaled $524 billion. This resulted in quarter ending ETF AUM of $2.5 trillion, which is 43% higher compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 48% year-over-year. Sequentially towards the end of the Second Quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $55 billion and market depreciation totaled $16 billion.  Exchange traded derivative activity was mixed during the quarter. Activity at the CBOE increased with S&amp;P 500 Index options activity increasing 39% and fixed futures and options activity increasing 31% Activity at the CME Equity complex decreased 6% due primarily to a 22% decrease in [Indiscernible] volumes. Ratings delivered very strong revenue growth, increasing 14% with strength in bank loan ratings, structured finance, and non-transaction activity. Adjusted expenses increased 9% primarily due to increased salaries, headcounts at CRISIL, growth initiatives and incentives.  This resulted in a 17% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 160 basis points increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On the trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin, increased 40 basis points to 63.8%. In China, we see continued momentum and interest in our ratings. We completed 15 ratings in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 46 compared to 22 in all last year. Non-transaction revenue increased 15% primarily due to growth in fees associated with surveillance, increased new entity ratings activity, Chrisol and Rating Evaluation Services revenue. Transaction revenue increased as a 150% increase in bank loan ratings activity and strong structure product issuance more than offset a decline in corporate bond issuance.  This slide depicts ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in ratings revenue was the 48% increase in structured finance driven by CLOs, CMBS and the ADS. In addition, corporates increased 14%, financial services increased 8%, governments decreased 12%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%. Market Intelligence delivered reported revenue growth of 7%, and 8% on an organic basis. More than 1/3 of the revenue growth was from recent product investments, which increased by 40% led by ESG and the S&amp;P Global Marketplace, adjusted expenses increased 4% primarily due to higher investment spending, particularly in ESG, S&amp;P Global marketplace, SME, and China, additional infrastructure spending, supporting our cloud initiatives, and S&amp;P Capital IQ Pro, and data, which is primarily license fees tied to aftermarket research revenue.  Adjusted segment operating profit increased 13%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 35.7%. On the trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 90 basis points to 33.8%. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category. Desktop revenue grew 6%, Data Management Solutions revenue grew 12%, Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 7%. And now turning to Platts, reported revenue increased 8%. Our core subscriptions increased 7%. It's notable that more than 1/3 of the growth came from new products primarily ESG and LNG. Global trading services had a great quarter, increasing 14% mainly due to strong LNG and petroleum volumes.  GTS activity often picks up when commodity prices become more volatile. Adjusted expenses increased 11% primarily due to growth initiatives, incentives, and commissions. In addition, expenses in the Third Quarter last year were aided by management actions. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 5% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 54.6%. The trailing four quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 55.6%.  Well, there was another revenue growth in every category, petrochemicals, natural gas, power and renewables, and shipping all delivered double-digit growth. Because the Company now anticipates closing the merger with IHS Markit in the first quarter of 2022, we're able to provide 2021 GAAP guidance for the first time. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. And this slide depicts our adjusted guidance. The third column shows our new 2021 adjusted guidance with all the line items that changed highlighted. We're making these changes primarily due to greater revenue growth in ratings and indices. Therefore, our revenue guidance is increased from high single-digit increase to a low double-digit increase.  Corporate unallocated is increased by $5 million to a new range of $140-150 million due to increased incentives and a charitable contribution. Operating profit margin is increased by a range of 40-60 basis points to a new range of 55-55.5%. This results in the $0.50 to $0.55 increase to adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $13.50 to $13.65. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased by $100 million to a range of $3.6 to $3.7 billion. In conclusion, 2021 is turning out to be an exceptionally strong year for the Company. All our businesses are delivering solid growth. We continue to expand our ESG product offerings, and we're making great progress on the upcoming merger with IHS Markit. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions. Chip Merritt Thank you. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to two questions in order allow time for other callers during today's Q&amp;A session. Operator, we will now take our first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open, ma'am. Manav Patnaik Thank you. I just had a question on the Capital IQ Pro platform that you talked about. It seems like that's been in the works for some time, perhaps it's out a little bit later than you guys had anticipated. But just talk about how you think that improves your competitive positioning. Are there any changes in that [Indiscernible] of the market from the competitive angle. Doug Peterson Thank you, Manav, this is Doug. Well, first of all, welcome everyone to the call. We had a lot to report today and then I'm pleased that you picked up that we've been able to launch the Capital IQ Pro platform. What it brings is its ability to, first of all, consolidate of many different information sources that we've had in the Company across the years. It has a much better interface if you've seen if you started using it. It also incorporates new Kensho capabilities and improves search.  It also has the data for ESG, it's easier to use for our risk services data. So across the board, it provides us with a competitive advantage of comprehensive data, ease-of-use, as well as new tools that make it easier to download data to move them into spreadsheets for chatting, etc. So we think it's an incremental leap forward and it gives us a much more competitive platform for the market. Manav Patnaik Got it. And then Doug, just on the issuance forecast for next year. I know you gave us the moving pieces by category, but just high level from a macro standpoint, I mean down 2% volume giving [inaudible 00:33:44] that bad compared to the strong two years that we've had. But the situation where you think the positives and negatives could be to that number. Doug Peterson Yeah, this is something as you know, we've seen a really interesting mix of the issuance this year. You saw the very strong issuance in loans which is driven by M&amp;A, we seeing so far in the quarter, we saw a drop of [Indiscernible] [inaudible 00:34:07] of 30%, while we saw an increase of structured finance of over 100%. So those are really big swings. We do see that the M&amp;A activity should continue forward. There's a lot of M&amp;A activity in the pipeline which would bode well for loan issuance. That's not something that's in the bond forecast itself, but in the bond forecast, we see that in Corporates, it's going to be down about 7%.  There continues to be a strong liquidity for those types of issuance. The trend is right now, there's not a very big pipeline of issuance of Corporates that we see. Financial Services had half strength the last couple of quarters. As you saw this quarter, Financial Institutions was up about 5%. In the U.S., it was actually up about 30%, so you did see some strength in that. So we do think that there's going to be some continuation up about 1% -- sorry, 1% for 2022.  For Structured Finance, we do think that there's going to be some continuation of interest in CLOs but I'm not sure if that will continue across all asset classes with about 3% increase. U.S. public finance are close to flat, around 2% up. And then finally, total, we look across all of those given the volume of corporates which went down 7%, that would bring the total down about 2% in 2022. And as we said on the call, this is a initial issuance forecasted bond. It's not a revenue forecast. Manav Patnaik Understood. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Manav. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh Great. Thanks so much. Hey, congratulations on the results. Doug, can you talk about ESG just within the context of longer-term opportunities. I mean, you're scaling it, it seems like the revenue was 24 million up from 22. And I think in the past, you talked about $100 million target and exceeding 300 million by 2024. You still comfortable with that, and is there a potential? Just put some takes on that as we think about bringing in IHS to the extent you can talk about that. Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Kevin. This is Ewout. Let me first take the first part of your question and then I will hand it over to Doug. And -- Kevin McVeigh Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen First, with respect to the revenue outlook for ESG for the full year, yes, we are still expecting to come in approximately $100 million of revenues for the full year. And one of the reasons is that there is some seasonality with respect to some revenues. Usually it's a bit higher in the fourth quarter. So year-to-date that 67 million of ESG revenues. And again, then we expect this to go up in the fourth quarter to approximately 100 million for the full year. So we are on track with respect to our forecast. the 40% CAGR that we expect over the next few years. And you see that we have a lot of positive momentum, a lot of new product launches, a lot of new initiatives going on, a lot of investments in ESG initiatives. So let me hand it over here to Doug. Doug Peterson Thank you, Kevin. Just a couple of points strategically in [Indiscernible], we have been able to put together the Sustainability1 Group under the leadership of Martina Chan (ph). And this has provided us with the ability to look across the entire organization for ways that we can link data and put together the latest needs for the market. As you saw, we launched the partnership with the Ford Foundation, Hamilton Lane, and [Indiscernible] for the Nevada platform for the private markets and private equity. So we're looking across all the different types of opportunities to bring ESG data into the market.  So you have the most transparency, the most comprehensive, consistent approach to providing those ESG solutions to the market. So this is something that we're looking at across the board in all the different aspects of how markets are starting to use ESG data. You should expect that we're going to continue to invest in this area. You should hear from us every quarter, that we've spent some money or invested in a different division to increase our sales force, our technical capabilities. And if you ask the question about where might we still be targeting some longer-term look at acquisitions, ESG would clearly be on that list. Kevin McVeigh Super helpful, and then just real quick, it seems like you're able to walk up the cost synergies and even the upper end of the revenue synergies, despite some additional divestments to get the deal over the goal line. Any thoughts on the broader categories of what the expense synergies are, and then, maybe, where some of that revenue comes in as well? Is that just your coming together, or just any thoughts as to what drove that upside there? Ewout Steenbergen Alright. Kevin, the short answer here it's that based on [Indiscernible] by large groups of people with a lot of rigor, substantiating synergy opportunities. We have been able to find a higher opportunities than we thought before. So let me expand a bit on that. You recall when we announced the transaction, we said that we had 350 million of revenue synergies and 480 million of cost synergies. That was based on very thorough process during due diligence. However, that was done by a smaller group of senior executives because, of course, a smaller group of people were aware that we're working on that transaction.  Since then, we have had work streams in place and four submission rounds with respect to synergies through a very rigorous process. And we have been able to look much deeper into all the synergy categories from integrating corporate functions, to optimizing real estate and technology, going very deep in procurement to clean room activities. Procurements, I already mentioned, eliminating duplicative costs, so many of those areas. And based on all of that very detailed work, we are confident now that you can raise those synergy targets, both for cost and revenues. Kevin McVeigh Thank you so much, congrats again. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks Kevin. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Andrew Nicolas with William Blair. Your line is open, sir. Andrew Nicolas Great, thank you. Maybe I'll start with a follow-up to the last question, which is just on the timing of cost synergies. I believe, of the 480 that you'd outlined initially, 390 were expected in the first 2 years. This additional 100 or so, is that a first-two-year opportunity or is that part of a longer tail? Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Andrew. What we're looking at is very similar trajectories with respect to expense synergies and revenue synergies that we told you before. Three-year cost synergy ramp, which is more front end loaded, and then five-year ramp for revenue synergies, which is more gradual over the five-year period of time. Andrew Nicolas Understood. Thank you. And then my next question, I appreciate you taking them, was just on the implied guidance for Fourth Quarter spend. Obviously after a really good quarter, it still looks like you're expecting more acceleration in spend. So I'm just wondering one, what the major drivers of that increase spend are in the Fourth Quarter, and then also as a jumping off point for 2022. Ewout Steenbergen Sure. Well, I have to be careful about 2022 because we're not providing guidance on that at this point in time. But let me give you some more details about the outlook for the remainder of the year. What you see, Andrew, is a bit of direction of different initiatives going in opposite directions. First, we have the productivity program where we take benefits so far this year from an expense growth perspective, as well as the pre -realized synergies on the S&amp;P Global sites that we mentioned in the prepared remarks, and of course, we are also taking benefit from the operating leverage.  But what goes in the opposite direction is the strategic investments we are making in the strategic initiatives. For example, in ESG. For example, in the energy transition in Platts. And then also our variable expenses are going up. I consider those good expenses because they are directly linked to our sales levels and our revenue levels. So think about incentive compensation commissions and cost of sales. So we expect those underlying trends to continue in the Fourth Quarter.  Specifically, I would like to call out Platts because the Platts expenses might be a little higher in the Fourth Quarter, similar to what you saw in the Third Quarter, because here you see particularly those variable expenses being a bit higher as well as the investments in the new initiatives. But that is also paying off because, as we mentioned, 1/3 of the revenue growth in Platts is coming from those new products. I hope that's helpful. Andrew Nicolas Yes, it is. Thanks a lot. Doug Peterson Thanks, Andrew. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari Good morning. My question was just around if you could just update us on the capital allocation framework going forward. I know the deal timeline is Q1. You also are planning how much free cash you're generating this year. Just update us on your thoughts on return of cash, post-deal closing. And then have the cost to achieve synergies changed at all with the updated cost synergy figures? Ewout Steenbergen I'm sorry. Good morning. So let me first take the capital return philosophy. You're absolutely right that we're building up significant cash as a Company. And our thinking about returning that, because obviously this is temporarily elevated. Returning that cash, the thinking about that is the following. First we have a catch up to do because for the last one and half years, we have not been able to do share buybacks.  And the same applies by the way, for IHS Markit, so IHS Markit can also not do share buyback so is also building up its cash position. Then what we should add is some of the proceeds of the divestitures that will help with the capital return capacity. And then very quickly after the completion of the transaction, we would like to move to our new capital return target of at least 85% of free cash flow.  So if you add up all of those pieces, then we're speaking about a very meaningful capital return number that we will be able to achieve after the completion of the transaction. I cannot give you a numerical answer on that right now, but what we are planning to do is give you the financial targets of the combined Company in the first quarter, again, after we complete the merger. With respect to your second part of the question the costs to achieve, so we're looking still at those 3 different categories with respect to our merger-related costs.  So we have transaction costs, integration costs, and cost to achieve. Cost to achieve in my view are, of course, the best category of costs because it's an investment to ultimately achieve those synergies. What we're looking at in terms of the overall best estimates with respect to the spend at the integration costs and the cost to achieve combined, we're looking at approximately 1.1 times the overall cost and revenue synergy. So that's our best estimate in terms of what the expected to spend for integration and cost to achieve but again, that is an investment in order to achieve ultimately those higher synergy numbers. Hamzah Mazari Very helpful, and my follow-up question, I'll turn it over as just -- around the China Ratings business. I know you outlined completing 15 domestic ratings, but do you view that environment as having changed for your business or not really? A lot of the headlines around China are a little more -- seems like it's tougher, but maybe it doesn't impact your business domestically, so just any thoughts there. Doug Peterson Yeah, thanks, Hamzah. Nice to hear from you. And as you mentioned, we did complete 15 ratings in the third quarter. It's actually 46 year-to-date, and that compares to 2020 -- '22 and all of 2020, so we know that growth isn't going to be a straight line. There's a lot of interest in our ratings. As you see, there's some credit events taking place in China right now, and those are bringing a lot of attention to our ratings and our methodology, how we think about informing the market. We see a big uptick in people attending our webinars, downloading our research.  We've also been pleased that we've been able to wait companies across the entire credit sector from AAA-BBB and then different types of companies, financial structured products, and our first non-financial corporate. But more to your question about the environment, we continue to see the financial regulators are very interested in reforming and updating their financial markets. We would see that when it comes to the ratings industry that there's interest in seeing more from us.  They are talking about some reforms that would make the ratings industry more transparent, and make it change some of the floors for what would be defined as a non-investment-grade rating. But very importantly, we also see a whole slew of international financial firms getting licenses to operate 100% owned or more than 51% owned operations in China. Recently, Goldman Sachs received approval to take full ownership of its Securities, JV. Others include Fidelity, JP Morgan, City, BlackRock, etc. So we do think that in the financial markets, we see a very different rhetoric and a willingness to openly reform the markets compared to what you see some times in other parts of the markets. Hamzah Mazari Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Hamzah. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra Thanks for taking my question. Just on the divestitures and the $420 million of revenues for the divestitures. I believe the ones that are already announced, Opus, CMM and Petrochem, those 129 million. I just wanted to confirm if that number is still right. And I was wondering if you could provide any incremental details on the other businesses, any further details on revenues for other businesses. Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Ashish. Indeed, that number is still correct, approximately 125 million revenue for Opus and its related business -- businesses like the coal metals and mining. And as Doug said in his prepared remark, 425 million for all of the divestitures, including Opus combined. Ashish Sabadra Okay. Then that's helpful. And then just a question on the Capital IQ Pro. Obviously that's getting pretty good traction with the rollout there. My question was, how does that help you pose the integration with IHS Markit? Does it make it easier for you to cross-sell IHS data into the Cap IQ customer base with the rollout of the IQ Pro, a pretty solid rollout of the IQ -- Capital IQ Pro platform. Thanks. Doug Peterson Yeah, Ashish, it definitely does. Having the Capital IQ Pro developed and delivered is important to us. It gives us confidence of our ability to integrate new datasets. It also is something that's on the desktop of already 90,000 users, which is growing rapidly. We believe that that gives us the ability to integrate new datasets, as you know related to the Market Intelligence business, we also have the data marketplace, which has the tiles for different datasets which are already curated, have the contracts around them.  That's another aspect of the Market Intelligence business that is going incredibly well, that will help us integrate the data [Indiscernible] and the data products also of IHS Markit. The progress, technologically, was how we've moved our operations to the cloud, the upgrade and updates we've been doing to the back-end, as well as now the ability we've delivered that front-end of S&amp;P Capital IQ Pro, are all going to help facilitate the integration. Chip Merritt Thanks, Ashish. Ashish Sabadra Sorry, go ahead. Doug Peterson Well, thank you very much. Ashish Sabadra Thanks, a lot. Thank you. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir. Jeff Silber Thanks so much. Wanted to switch over to the indices business. The performance has really been remarkable the past few quarters, and I think you've had three straight quarters of adjusted operating margin above 70%. Is that the new bar going forward? Is that sustainable? Ewout Steenbergen Hello, Jeff, this is Ewout. With respects to the outlook for margins for indices, I can only give you the outlook for 2021 and that is approximately 70% margin for the full year. And we will get back to you in the First Quarter when we do our Fourth Quarter earnings call with respect to specific guidance for 2022. Jeff Silber Okay. I thought I'd try, but thank you anyhow. And then just moving back to the merger, can you just remind us where we stand in terms of milestones, in terms of what we're looking for over the next few months. Doug Peterson Let me take that and what we're looking over the next few months is to continue to meet the requirements that we've agreed with the regulators on where we're going to be divesting of some businesses so that we can close the transaction. As you saw this week or last week, we were able to reach some agreements with the EC for the approval of some conditions and what they call remedies, which include the divestiture of Opus that they include what's now the divestiture of CUSIP.  And then also LCD and loan indices. We have about six months from now to close the LCD and the loan indices and those are not conditions to close the transaction, CUSIP is. And then with the CMA in the UK, we also have the condition of the Opus transaction and now something else is being added that's called Base Chemicals. And we'll -- we heard from them this morning that in general, they approved of that as a remedy, that they would expect meets the needs. We also want to make sure that over the next 3 or 4 months that we have time to follow through on a very thorough and robust process to get full value for all of these divestitures.  So in a sense right now getting those divestitures, meeting the requirements of those regulators are the remedies that they saw that created competitive positions that they thought would be too strong including -- completing those divestitures is going to be the gating factor. But we also want to do it, as I said, in a way that's professional, robust, and we get full value. So you should be watching that. We'll be providing more information as things crop up that we can talk about, but be assured that this is something that's on the top of our list right now of things we have to get done. Jeff Silber Okay. I really appreciate the color. Thank you so much. Ewout Steenbergen If I may build on Doug 's answer, with respect to milestones, we also have, of course, the milestones around the merger planning process. And I think we're well underway, a lot of positive initiatives that are going on in both organizations. And we are looking at, for example, getting ready for day 1 and being able to operate as one combined Company on day 1: system integrations, people planning, synergies [Indiscernible]. So also a lot of milestones that we are working on So, the more overall planning process. Jeff Silber Thank you. Chip Merritt Thanks, Jeff. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. Toni Kaplan Thank you. Wanted to ask about the recurring revenue within the Ratings Business. It's very strong again at 15%, fourth quarter of double-digit growth. Going forward, should we expect sort of a similar growth rate there? And just broadly, has there been any change from issuers when deciding whether to enter a frequent issuer program, especially as debt balances continue to rise, or has that not really changed at this point? Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Toni. Indeed, very positive -- continued positive revenue growth in the non-transaction category for ratings. And we also expect that to continue for the full year for the outlook for non-transaction revenue is now low double-digits growth. What you see is underneath is a couple of developments. First, we are seeing that surveillance fees are going up that is being helped last year by the very high level of bonds issuance activity.  And this year, of course, by bank loan rating activity, where we also are receiving surveillance fees. So indeed some part of that you may expect to also continue in the future beyond 2021. Then what we also see is a lot of activity with respect to initial credit ratings this year, rating evaluation surface, which is helped by the M&amp;A environment, and then CRISIL also is doing very well and is also showing very healthy growth. So all of the underlying categories in loan transaction revenue doing very well. Toni Kaplan That's really helpful color. And just for my follow-up, given that, I know you're less exposed to some of the labor for pressures we're seeing across some of our diversified names. But that being said, can you comment on if you're seeing any headwinds on the labor side? Is it harder to find people just want to understand what's going on with your employment. Ewout Steenbergen Absolutely, Toni. We're monitoring this at very closely both indeed from a quality of people that we can attract and retain, as well as overall from a cost perspective because, of course, the largest cost category we have is staff cost as a Company is about 70% of our overall cost base. We by the way, see this both as a risk as -- and as an opportunity because it's -- there are a lot of people on the move in the labor markets. It's also a clear opportunity to pick up some really good talent as a Company [Indiscernible], with the hybrid working [Indiscernible] that we are introducing, we also think that it is attractive as an employer that we can offer that.  And it also offers up on the possibility to look at talent in a much wider geographical area that we're looking at before so we're closely monitoring this. At this point in time, our economist believe that the inflation pressure should be transitory. So that's more our base case, but we're definitely running stress tests to think about if inflation would be more permanent, what that would mean for the Company, and what management actions we can take. Toni Kaplan That's great. Thank you so much. Chip Merritt Thanks, Toni. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open, sir. Craig Huber Hi, my first question. Typically you guys raise prices on average 3% to 4% per year. For your legacy business this year, is that a reasonable range, and is there any areas around that are significantly higher or lower than that? Then I'll have a follow-up. Thank you. Doug Peterson Craig, as you know, we typically will price somewhere around 2, 3%. We try to look at what are the trends in the markets on inflation, but that's -- would continue to be our expectation going forward but we don't have any further guidance or update on that right now. Craig Huber Okay. Then my other question, Doug, your outlook for debt issuance this upcoming years, I guess, down 2% excludes bank loans, if I heard you right. Can you just comment if you would, what's your best assessment, how you think bank loan issuance will do next year given the huge strength you guys have seen this year? Thank you. Doug Peterson I don't have a bank loan issuance forecast from the team. And I do -- I would only say that we do see a very strong pipeline for M&amp;A and LBOs. That is always one of the most important elements that figures into that. But we'll be providing more guidance on that, at our next Earnings Call. Craig Huber Thank you. Chip Merritt Thanks, Craig. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Your line is open, sir. Andrew Steinerman I'll be quick. Ewout, could you just help us a little bit more understanding of the fourth quarter? Just a comment about the four segments and how they are likely to do on an organic revenue growth basis to puzzle in to the full-year '21 guide that you gave on Slide 43. Ewout Steenbergen Sure. Andrew. We're looking now at outlook with respect to revenue growth for our decisions. The Index business, double-digits, revenue growth ratings, low double-digits, We have Platts at high single-digits, and we have MI at mid-to-high single digits. And then with respect to the margin outlook for the full year, we have, as I said before, indices around 70%, ratings mid 60s, Platts mid 50s, and then MI mid 30s. Continued positive momentum, healthy top-line growth, and healthy margins for all of our segments. Andrew Steinerman Perfect. Thank you so much. Doug Peterson That's been a full year. [Indiscernible] Ewout Steenbergen Those are full-year, correct. Andrew Steinerman Okay. We'll puzzle into fourth quarter. Thanks for highlighting that, appreciate that. Operator Thank you for the question. Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong Hi, thanks Good morning. Are you now increased your guidance for debt issuance and ratings revenue three quarters in a row, well why shouldn't the factors that drove up performance persist into 2022. Doug Peterson I don't have any reason whatsoever to try to give a forecast in 2022 right now that goes beyond what our own team, who are the people in the markets every day, have looked at. Clearly, there's a lot of factors which go into the decision of organizations to issue debt or to undertake an M&amp;A deal and what sort of instrument did they undertake to finance it with whether it's a loan, how it gets packaged in CLO, et c? There is a lot of liquidity in the market. We do see a strong M&amp;A pipeline right now and so those are things that will factor in when we bring you the full year update in our guidance on our next earnings call. George Tong Okay. Got it. You increased your synergy target associated with the info merger. Which businesses do you expect these incremental synergies to come from, predominantly, or is it relatively evenly spaced across the business? Ewout Steenbergen George, it will be across the board in many different categories, in all of the segments, as well as also in the functional areas. Let me give you a couple examples of that so that you can get more the feel behind it. First, a lot of work has been underway in what we call the procurements clean room. About 2.5 billion of spend of both companies has been analyzed, there are 25,000 active contracts, and that has led to some opportunities -- further opportunities that have been identified.  Also, there is a clean room for cross-sell, and we have filed about 200 synergies with respect to cross-sell food at clean room activity. And then what we did not expect before were shortened synergy benefits from segments that we basically did not have on the list before. So we now have synergies also being identified in ratings, in transportation, in CME, and in Crystal. So those are a couple of examples, but I would say in general, really more opportunities in all of the areas across both organizations. And of course, tend to combined Company in the future. George Tong Great. Thank you. Chip Merritt Thanks, George. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir. Owen Lau Thank you. I'll be quick. Could you please talk about the rationale behind how you came down to the conclusion to divest CUSIP and LCD? And then are all these divestitures contingent to the completion of the INFO deal? Thank you. Doug Peterson Yes. Thank you, Owen. Well, as you know, these are businesses that the EC and the CMA have looked at with a lot of depth. They go to the market, they go to market participants to ask them to look at the businesses as we bring them together and to give them feedback as to what would be the competitiveness of those businesses. So when it comes to the discussion with the EC, they determined that CUSIP and LCD, and the loan indices would create some sort of an additional competitive advantage.  And in the discussions with them, and looking at their understanding of belief through the market position, we agreed that that would be a remedy that would meet their needs to ensure that we didn't have a dominant position in the markets. So this is a -- this is something that they looked at. You can actually read their letter that has been published, that they have the -- they have a very short couple of paragraphs that described their views of that and how they feel about it.  But they've also given us what they call an approval with conditions which we think was a very positive aspect. Similarly with the CMA, they go to the markets, they listen to market participants, and they came back with the discussion about the Base Chemicals business that would also create a competitive issue in the UK. And in discussions in negotiations with them, we also agreed that that would be a condition that we would meet in order to get approval on the transaction.  So these are what the regulators do, they look at the market, they speak with market participants, and then we discuss these with them. And in these cases, we've agreed that we would make these divestitures in order to close the deal. You asked about conditionality. It's our understanding in the case of the CMA, we would need to have a buyer identified, that they would that they would vet, of the Base Chemicals business and also the OPIS business, in which we already have a buyer, and in the case of the EC, we'd have to have a buyer identified for the OPIS and related businesses, which we already have, and then for CUSIP, we'd have to have a buyer we have identified and vetted before we can close the deal. But for LCD and loan indices, we have six months from now, and we could close the deal without having a buyer for that transaction. Owen Lau That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Chip Merritt Thanks, Owen. Operator Thank you for your question. The next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open, sir. Jeff Meuler Yeah. Thank you. On the Cap IQ and Platts upgraded platforms, as you upgrade an existing client, is there incremental revenue at the point of upgrade or is this all about driving usage and then you capture the better monetization on the back-end. And then on the expense side, is there a sizable opportunity to save on costs as you censored some of the legacy platforms eventually? Doug Peterson There's a few aspects to this. One is related to something you mentioned and that is that as we improve our capabilities and make it easier to find data, to search it, to chart it, to download it, etc. That makes the products more sticky, it makes more people are use the product, it brings more people to the platform, which is a virtuous cycle which then allows us to have a stronger negotiations when it comes to price increases. So there is not necessarily a direct increase that comes from the launch of these platforms, but it does give us a virtual cycle. In addition, it makes it easier for -- to plug-in and add new datasets which do sometimes bring new contracts and new revenue along with those.  In addition, you asked about the expense side of this. As we redeploy resources from turning off and changing older platforms, it allows us to either have an expense save or in many cases it allows us to redeploy those programmers and developers into areas where the highest growth opportunities, like what we've talked about earlier, something on ESG, private markets are the areas that we're quite excited about with the merger with IHS Markit, how we're going to be able to bring energy transition products, further credit in this products, etc. We can get some savings but also look at how we're going to redeploy our development talent to the highest opportunities for the future growth. Jeff Meuler Okay. Got it. Thank you. Chip Merritt Thank you. Thanks, Jeff. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open, Sir. Shlomo Rosenbaum Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey Ewout, I apologize if I missed this but the divested businesses I heard are going to be 425 million in revenue. But what would the EBIT or EBITDA of those businesses be on a collective basis. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Shlomo. Good morning. No, we haven't mentioned that specifically. But what Doug said during his prepared remarks is that the margins on these businesses are higher than the margins of the respective segments where these businesses are reported today. So these are businesses with a bit higher margins than you see on average. And however, if you think about it, the revenues of those 4 businesses is approximately 4% of the revenues off the proforma combined Company. So they are four, the overall impact on the margins of the Company is relatively modest. And then also take into consideration that the overall synergy numbers we have moved up with these announcements. Shlomo Rosenbaum If the synergies are moving up, so does that go until offset -- in other words, how should I think of the offset? Should I think of it in terms of the share repurchases is going to be the primary offset, or some of the increased synergies? How are you guys thinking of that in terms of the lost [Indiscernible]. Ewout Steenbergen Yes. The way to think about it is maybe 3 elements. So you could say the starting point for the combined Company, the margins are slightly, modestly lower, based on these divestments. But then we will see two positives coming out of it. One is higher synergy opportunity which will help to drive the margin stand further up in the future, as well as the proceeds of these divestments will help with additional buyback capacity, which is also of course, a positive thing for the EPS, in order to offset the lost earnings. Shlomo Rosenbaum Okay. Thank you for your line to follow-up. Just one thing I haven't heard before was a termination fee on ETFs. Could you just elaborate on that a little bit more. Are they going to internal indices that they're creating on their own or what happened all of a sudden? Doug Peterson As you know, in the index business occasionally, an organization will rebalance or maybe they might bring together some indices and switch to another party. And when we have a contract in place with an index provider that our -- sorry, ETF provider diffusing our index if they switch, it could be the built in the contract there's an early cancellation fee and that would be the case that we saw during this quarter. Shlomo Rosenbaum Okay. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thank you. Operator Thank you for your questions. We will now take our final question from Alex Kramm with UBS. Sir, you may ask your question. Alex Kramm Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just one quick follow-up on the upside to synergies. Can you -- I know you've given a lot of color, but can you give a little bit more detail in terms of what you were able to look into now given that the deal is not close d and what is still prevented? I guess what I'm asking, and I know I'm getting ahead of myself here, what further synergy opportunities may be out there that you haven't been able to tackle? As for example, you may look at the IHS Markit stand-alone cost base a little bit further once you own the Company. What are the things that you already have in your mind that you're just not willing to put numbers around yet? And again, I know I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit. Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Alex, and really appreciate your joining the call today. I think you should see this in the following way. We do have, of course, certain restrictions legally with respect to how far we can look into certain details with respect to financials in terms of commercial agreements, in terms of procurement agreements, because the two Companies are still run as standalone entities at this point in time. So the way -- how you can solve for that partially is through so-called clean rooms, where you have a separate segregated area where people can look into those particular details, that can never be shared with any of the respective organizations.  So definitely, after we are able to complete the transaction, we have an opportunity to look even more deeper into all of that and further make those synergy numbers more robust compared to what we have now. But again, as I said before, we think that we have a very rigorous process in place. We have already had four submission rounds, bottom up substantiation of all of the synergies, we'll have a fifth around before the ultimate completion of their transaction. And then definitely of course, we'll then learn more after we can start to operate as a combined Company. Alex Kramm All right. Well, thank you very much. That's it from me. Doug Peterson Great. Thank you, Alex. I'm going to make some closing remarks. And first of all, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. And as you saw, we had very strong performance in the third quarter. We delivered exceptional financial results with a 13% topline growth and adjusted diluted EPS of 24% growth. We launched new product platforms, we advanced our ESG propositions and many, many more things going on.  And as we're able to talk about, we're moving forward on the IHS Markit merger. This is something that we're very excited about. The path towards regulatory approval is getting clear. We now have to execute on the divestitures that we discussed today to achieve the full value, but also, we don't want to rush. We want to have time to close and also to make sure that we can execute those transactions well. Doug Peterson Well, as you know, we also have integration planning going on which is identifying synergies. But more importantly, it's also identifying strategies for our businesses. How we're going to work together, how we are going to address the needs of our customers, how we're going to be bringing together technology and very importantly data. And then most importantly, our people and our culture, and all of this work is going extremely well. But today on this call, I also want to thank our people.  They've been working now for 600 days. It sounds like a lot, it's 600 days people been working from home and working remotely, starting to come back to the offices. And when they do, I'd love to welcome them depending on which offices we're around the world. But our people have been dedicated, they've been working hard. They may be able to deliver the kind of results that you saw earlier as well as work on this exciting transformation for the Company with the merger. They've been diligent.  They're helping rethink and reimagine the future of the work. And I want to thank them for all of their dedication and commitment to making this Company what it is and looking forward to the future for building an even better Company. And then finally, I want to thank everyone on the call, the analysts for your questions, and also the shareholders for your support. And thank you very much looking forward to a great Fourth Quarter and the holidays at the end of the year. Thanks, everyone. Operator This concludes this morning's call.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit’s filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Jonathan Gear, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions. With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance. Lance Uggla Thank you, Eric. And thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 earnings call. We had another very strong quarter. Q3 revenue was $1.18 billion, with organic growth of 9%, adjusted EBITDA of $516 million with margin of 43.7% puts us on track for the full year margin expansion of 100 basis points, excluding FX. Adjusted EPS of $0.85 will be up 10% over the prior year. Overall, we are very happy with our Q3 and year-to-date results, and we are raising our full year underlying revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. In terms of industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had another strong quarter with 8% organic growth in Q3. Within financial services, information performed well with organic growth of 6% and the main contributors of this included pricing, valuations, equities, regulatory reporting and trading analytics platforms and our issuer solutions products due to strong IPO markets, and the momentum in ESG initiatives. Solutions also had a strong quarter with 9% organic growth and similar trends which we saw in Q2 due to the strong market activity in equities and loans as well as the continued broad based rebound of the investments being made by our customers in solutions. This strength was accelerated by our new offerings and enhancements across the solutions portfolio. Finally, our processing business grew 12% organically with strengths in loans and derivatives performance as expected. For the full year, we still expect financial services to be in the 7% to 8% organic growth range. Let’s move on to transportation, which had organic revenue growth of 15% in Q3. You'll recall that the basis for comparison, the third quarter of 2020, was depressed by significant pricing concessions that we granted our customers at the height of the COVID-related lockdowns. But like Q2, this quarter’s performance also reflected strong underlying growth across the transportation businesses. Our renewal performance was strong across the board, demonstrating the must have nature of our products in the current challenging market environment. For example, CARFAX for Life has now established itself as a critical and innovative service loyalty solution for dealers. At a time when driving higher levels of service lane activity is key to offsetting the lower levels of new car sales. Another example is the strong performance of our forecasting solutions, as the industry grapples with the largest supply chain shock it has ever experienced. However, over the past two months, we have also seen the escalating supply chain crisis lead to further production cuts. And as a result of shortage of cars on dealer lots, we are seeing a temporary slowdown in sales of products that support OEM and dealer and sales, marketing -- sales and marketing. We remain very confident in the outlook for these products as inventory levels begin to recover. But overall, another great quarter for our auto businesses, which demonstrates the importance of our services to the industries. Our maritime and trade business continued to perform well, driven by momentum of our innovative risk and compliance solutions and by our growing footprint in the financial sector. I'm very pleased to see our new product investments over the past several years continuing to pay off. For the full year, we expect transportation organic growth to be in the 14% to 16% range. This represents a healthy underlying high-single-digit growth rate, excluding the favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the pandemic. Let's move on to resources, where organic decline was a modest 1% in Q3 and as expected. Recurring revenue improved sequentially across our businesses and non-recurring revenue benefited from increased demand for consulting services and our software businesses. As expected, our ACV experience continued positive growth in Q3, which we believe should continue in Q4, providing a strong foundation for our 2022 recurring revenue. Our downstream organic revenue growth was very strong in the quarter, and we expect this to continue into Q4 as we help our customers navigate global supply chain disruptions in many markets. In 2021, we continued to expect organic revenue results within resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low-single digits as the upstream improves and strong growth in downstream continuous. Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was strong at 11% and 5%, normalized for the BPVC. And particularly, ECR was very strong and is benefiting from increased consulting services as a result of uncertainty due to global supply chain disruptions. For the full year, we still expect CMS to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth. There were two strategic initiatives announced in the quarter. We completed the formation of the OSTTRA JV, which includes our MarkitSERV and CMEs optimization businesses. We also signed a purchase agreement for the divestiture of Opus commensurate with the close of the merger with S&amp;P Global. And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan. Jonathan Gear Great, thank you Lance. Q3 highlights included revenue organic growth of 9%, which is 8%, normalized to BPVC, adjusted EBITDA growth of 6%, GAAP net income declined 2%, EPS declined 2%, while adjusted EPS had growth of 10% year-over-year. Regarding revenue, our Q3 revenue was $1.18 billion, with total growth of 10%. Organic growth in the quarter was 9%, which included recurring organic growth of 7% and non-recurring organic growth of 20%  Normalized for BPVC, total company organic growth is 8% and non-recurring is 14%. This increase was driven by continued strong underlying growth in financial services and transportation, as well as benefiting from favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the impact of COVID primarily in our dealer facing transportation businesses. Moving on to segment performance, our financial services segment drove organic growth of 8%, including 7% recurring in the quarter. Overall strength was anchored by strong market activities in equities, loans, and the continued rebound of investment by our customers. Solutions had strong organic growth performance delivering 9%, information grew 6% and processing grew 12%. Our transportation segment delivered organic growth of 15% in the quarter. This included growth of 17% recurring as Q3 continued to have strong growth within our CARFAX and automotive mastermind businesses and accelerating growth within our maritime and trade business. Non-recurring revenue increased by 8% primarily driven by strong performance in CARFAX consumer and dealer transactions and within our core automotive insights. Our resources segment declined by 1%, which is comprised of a 4% recurring decline and 30% non-recurring increase. Q3 organic ACB increased by 7 million in the quarter and our trailing 12-month organic ACB is down 3%. However, we are seeing strong underlying trends and our upstream pipeline, especially in North America; as we expect CapEx spend to begin to rebound in 2022. We continue to see strong demand in our downstream businesses, particularly in our products and services that support energy transition and energy market supply chains. Our CMS segment had 11% organic growth, including 5% recurring and an increase of 76% non-recurring. Normalized the BPVC, total CMS organic growth is 5% which includes non-recurring organic growth of 14%. Moving now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA was $516 million, up $29 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6% with a margin of 43.7%, down 150 basis points and down 110 basis points FX adjusted. As a reminder, the margin percentages for the full company and segments were impacted because 2020 margins benefited significantly due to temporary COVID related costs actions. Moving to our segments, financial services adjusted EBITDA margin of 49.2% down 90 basis points FX adjusted, transportations adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.1%, down 280 basis points FX adjusted. Resources adjusted EBITDA margin of 40.2%, a decrease of 100 basis points FX adjusted and CMS adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.7% up 240 basis points FX adjusted. Moving now to net income and EPS, net income was $161 million and GAAP EPS was $0.40. Adjusted EPS was $0.85 an increase of 10% over prior year. Our GAAP tax rate was 30% and our adjusted tax rate was 16%. Q3 free cash flow was $344 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow conversion is 56%. Turning to the balance sheet, our Q3 ending debt balance was $4.9 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.5 times on a bank covenant basis, and 2.3 times net of cash. We closed the quarter with $338 million of cash and our Q3 unbound revolver balance was approximately $1 billion. Our Q3 weighted average diluted share count was 401.3 million shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&amp;P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares and therefore our share repurchase program is currently suspended other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share based compensation. Moving on to guidance, based on our performance through the first three quarters of the year, we are positioned to deliver strong full year results and providing the following improvements to revenue and EPS guidance for FY 2021. On revenue, we are providing three updates to our guidance. First, based on this strong performance and the core review of our business, we are raising the operational outlook for revenue by $20 million at the midpoint. Second, we are adjusting our revenue for the year due to the accounting treatments of the MarkitSERV joint venture. Under this 50:50 joint venture, we will no longer consolidate revenue. This will remove $45 million from our Q4 revenue guidance. It should be noted that we will receive 50% of the JVs earnings in our reported earnings, and thus there will be no impact of the structure to either EBITDA or EPS. Finally, we are lowering revenue for the year by $10 million due to the FX impact in the second half. The net of these adjustments is our new range of $4.61 billion to $4.63 billion, which represents a 7% to 8% organic growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA is being maintained at $2.02 billion to $2.03 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points adjusted for FX, and adjusted EPS is being increased by $0.03 to $3.18 to $3.20 per share. We do expect cash conversion in the Upper 50s due primarily to the one time impact of the MarkitSERV joint venture and also with S&amp;P Global deal related merger cost. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Lance. Lance Uggla Okay, thanks Jonathan. We had another strong quarter. And our results today set us up to have a great year due to improving end markets and very strong execution by our teams. As this may be our last earnings call as IHS Markit, I want to thank our many investors over the years for their support and say that I'm very excited to be a future shareholder of S&amp;P Global, as they integrate IHS Markit to create even greater value in the years to come. Operator we're now ready to open the lines for Q&amp;A. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open Kevin McVeigh Thank you and congratulations to all of you folks, if this is the last call, you've been an amazing management team, and it's been a pleasure to work with you folks. So hey, Lance you talked about kind of supply chain disruption a lot, and obviously the business is thriving within the context of that. How much of that is obviously -- there's a lot of shock in the system. But just trying to understand how much of that is that maybe just reshoring structural changes in businesses post COVID? So, I guess, is there any kind of nuances between just structural reshoring as opposed to near term, just supply shock? Lance Uggla Yes, I think most all of our supply chain disruption is short-term related. I think some of it with respect to China and longer term geopolitics will bode well for us. We saw very positive supply chain impacts in terms of upward revenue in our chemicals pricing businesses, our economic and country risk services that have a supply chain product built into them and our consulting services as well. So, I think in an information business, volatility always bodes well across the whole portfolio, and there are pluses and minuses as our automotive business is expecting. As car sales wane through the supply chain shortages that are unprecedented, coupled with less used cars available. Those can have temporary negative impacts, but net net when we look across the whole firm, and we look at our revenue for the year, and our expectations as we start next year, it's a short term set of pluses and minuses that provide the same guidance as we expected at the beginning of the year. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Gary Bisbee Hey, guys, good morning, I'll have my congratulations on a terrific run. I guess, I just wanted to ask about the impact of the MarkitSERV joint venture. On a full year basis, for the business does it make sense to effectively quadruple that Q4 revenue hit? And are there other things we should think about? How it impacts margins, pulling that business out and any other any other color would be helpful. Thank you. Lance Uggla Okay. Thanks Gary, and thanks Kevin, as well for the complements. I appreciate that. Why don’t I pass that over to Jonathan, and if he wants to add Adam to that, on the OSTTRA impacts they can do so Jonathan? Jonathan Gear Sure, we'll do it. Gary, I would take this as very simple math. I would take this - the 45 we just spoke about for Q4, roughly four times that would be a full year impact of removing the MarkitSERV revenue from our reported results. As I mentioned them in my in my comments earlier, we will still report profit through earnings and so there will be no impact on EBITDA and EPS in an absolute basis. Of course, when you take out the revenues, you've obtained the earnings, there will be a lift on a margin percentage. And Adam, anything you want to add to that? Adam Kansler So sorry, I have nothing to add, obviously. And then the benefits of the JV commercially while we're quite excited about as our -- as our customers. Lance Uggla Okay, next question. Operator Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open. Jeffrey Meuler Yes, thanks. I'm hoping you can provide some more detail on the auto comments. So, I think you said it impacts the solutions that support OEM and dealer sales and marketing. So, is this automotive mastermind, digital marketing and maybe CARFAX use car listings? Because I think you said AMM was strong in Q3. So, trying to understand to what extent something like digital marketing is already impacting non-recurring revenue or if you're saying like automotive mastermind, bookings are softening and we should expect deceleration in coming quarters in recurring and cheers and best wishes from me. Thanks, guys. Lance Uggla Edouard, do you want to go a bit deeper on that? Edouard Tavernier Yes, sure. Thank you, Lance. And thanks Jeff, for the question. So as Lance said, all of this, so the disruption creates multiple impacts across our business, some are headwinds, some are tailwinds. So, at the upper end of the supply chain, when there's disruption, we do more business with suppliers. And actually, we've never had closer relationship with many of our supply customers than today. On the new car sales; and your right, right now, we're seeing a temporary softening of bookings in a couple of areas, you name them, right mastermind and digital marketing. And we expect these to be a bit softer than they usually are until inventory starts to recover. On the used car side, we're not seeing that, right. If you think about the used car market and the service market, actually, the combination of low inventory and high prices means that market is pretty hard, and that impact is neutral to positive in our business. So all-in-all, I would say the impact is not material in the grand scheme of things. It does not change our outlook for the business, but we do want to [flag it] (pb) because we recently revised our forecast downwards for the industry across the board, and you'll see quite a few suppliers and car makers referring to these new forecasts in the coming weeks as they talk about their Q3 earnings. Lance Uggla Thanks, Edouard, next question. Operator Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. Alex Kramm Yes. Hey, everyone, just on the on the energy side, hoping now that the fiscal year is over, did you just -- can you just give us a reminder of all the multiyear contracts you locked in. I guess what I'm asking is, you made this comment that CapEx is expected to be up next year. But, if it doesn't, I guess how much roles do you have built in because of some of those multiyear contracts and those pricing escalators, we would be great to just get a reminder where we stand on those. Thanks. Lance Uggla Okay, I'll start and then I'll pass it to Brian for some more detail. So we expect, as we said before our recovery on revenue to be, mid-single digits for energy next year for resources coming from that recovery. Those contracts rolling through and continued strength in all the downstream products. We've, we've stated that earlier, as we did those price cuts, and I think Brian may want to add some color on exactly how those numbers will unfold. Brian? Brian Crotty Yes. So yes, we basically did multiyear agreements with price cuts on 50% of the upstream business. We're starting to see those come in now which is nice. And when you coupled out with $70 crude, you mentioned CapEx. We think CapEx is going to be pretty strong next year 24% [ph]. So, definitely the, the energy horizon turned around Preston, we're feeling pretty good about, the next few quarters. Lance Uggla Thanks, Brian. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari Good morning. Thank you. My question is just around the upcoming merger with S&amp;P, maybe if you could just talk about timing wise, next steps, seems like, closing Q4, but any anything you can share on pre planning, integration work you're doing that gives you sort of confidence on the revenue synergies highlighted. And again, congrats on building a great company and all the work you've done here. Thank you. Lance Uggla Okay, thank you very much. Well, the work on the merger by the teams at S&amp;P, and I just could have been substantive given that we originally expected a July close, we've had several extra months through the summer in here in the fall, to really, ready ourselves for the opportunity set of this merger, both on the revenue cost take out organization, and of course, building, pausing the share buybacks in both companies has provided for that, that opportunity set to be launched as we look forward. On timing, we've said the, our expectation was calendar, the calendar year Q4, which we're rapidly on top of here as we approach October One. We haven't changed our forecasts on that. But I always, I said to my team, or when people ask me that question, that if it rolled into the new year into January, it wouldn't surprise me. So, we're on track everything, the teams are doing a great job. They're doing all the work that's needed to get the deal closed. And we're, we're rapidly approaching the end of the year. And I hope we can I hope we can complete in that schedule. But wouldn't surprise me if it was 30 days later, but I don't have that information to share. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong Hi, thanks. Good morning. I'd also like to say congrats, and thanks for the partnership over the years. You're raising your operating outlook for revenue by $20 million for the full year. Can you elaborate on where the upside is coming from? Lance Uggla It really, I have to say, it's coming from all across the firm, George. So pleased, I'd love to brag a bit about all the work that the CMS team has done. Since the merger of IHS with Markit, we've rebuilt the platforms built out a whole digital product suite. I was really pleased to show that mid-single digit ex-BPVC revenue, and congratulations to Ken Honroth and their team -- real good job. ECR has been a -- slow low single digit grower. They built out these new supply chain products, the world and geopolitics is driving demand into their product base. So net net, the teams there have, been additive or accretive to the, the overall growth of where they used to be, and that makes everybody's job easier. Automotive strong recovery expected to continue. The underlying core of automotive and high single digits is right where we've always talked about as being and we don't see that changing. Hats off really to the mastermind team. That acquisition is turned out to be a very, very important forward component. I know many of our shareholders challenged us on that. Acquisition is not being as accretive as we wanted to do early on. The teams stuck, stuck with it in terms of the build out of the enterprise mastermind products, those have been rolled out to two major dealers, and lots more to come, new products in CARFAX for life taken hold. Dick, and the team really excellent execution. You get into financial services, the Ipreo acquisition, again our last two acquisitions, these are real, the real fruits of those acquisitions are showing the private equity markets around eye level, substantively building recovery of investments in solutions, really, really excellent acquisition, that's turning into strong organic growth now. And then in energy, we’re who would have thought it you're a $70 oil price heading towards 100. It's a, CapEx recovery; you've got the world recover. And, that midstream, mid digit look across resources next year, coupled with recovered CMS, strong financial services. And automotive, view is we're at the top end of our long term, 5% to 7% guidance that we provide. And both that bodes well for the firm. So very mixed strong revenue growth organically. Looking to achieve the 100 basis points of course, is our normal expected takeout with the rest going into investing in new products and, new opportunity sets. So great job, it's probably my last chance publicly to congratulate the teams. But I have to say whether it was through Markit or post the IHS Markit’s merger, teams did focus on incremental organic growth, incremental margin expansion, steady investments in our organic strategy, and where we look to make sure we get the best out of that. And the follow through to earnings has been excellent. And I don't expect that to change. I think with S&amp;P Global, there's a whole new set of revenue opportunities, and of course, substantive cost synergies and share buybacks ahead. So lots to look forward to and it's been a real exciting journey. But the excitement doesn't stop here. Next question? Operator Our last question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan Terrific. Thank you. And Lance and Jonathan, always a pleasure speaking with you. One topic that has been coming up a lot with investors recently has been the area of fixed income indices, as it relates to the deal with S&amp;P. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what areas of synergies you would generate within the combined entity. I'd imagine the main areas are creating products in multi asset class and ESG. But if there's any others, or if you're able to expand on what you're most excited about there with the combined products, that will be really helpful, thanks. Lance Uggla Okay. Thanks, Toni. And thanks for your support. And you're getting our last question. So I'll start and then I'm going to hand it to Adam. I think the most exciting thing about the fixed income indices is the combination with S&amp;P Global, but not so much from product creation. I think product creation both groups are highly product oriented. They're both innovative, they both like to create. But if you look over the years, whether it was S&amp;P, Global MSCI, FTSE, etcetera, they all wanted to build up fixed income franchises. And really, in the early days, you really needed the bank partnership to build strong, fixed income indices, because you really needed to align the underlying prices with the OTC marketplaces. And that's shifted over time. But, today, the combination is really about a huge footprint and marketing platform that S&amp;P Global has for their index franchise and getting to overlay that across the fixed income franchises, is going to be really a great uplift in terms of sales and opportunity. The second thing, of course, is what you'd mentioned is opportunities to create new indices and maybe I'll let Adam talk a little bit about some of the synergistic revenues that we expect to get out of the combination. And we'll, we'll pass that pass that over to Adam now. Thank you for your question, Adam? Adam Kansler Yes, great, thank you. Very excited about that combination. We're proud of what we built in fixed income indices. And I know with this scale that S&amp;P indices will bring all the things Lance highlighted, will give will give that franchise a much broader reach than it's ever had. I think key areas to think about in the combined businesses, multi asset classes you mentioned, but also in private markets in ESG and bringing the fixed income indices into that arena. I think that's the area of new products that I think we'll continue to see substantial growth and I think combined with the kinds of data sets that S&amp;P and IHS Markit together will have the possibility for new indices, whether it's in carbon, crypto ESG, all across the fixed income world, globally. I think the opportunity set for us is pretty, pretty robust. Lance Uggla Thanks, Adam. With that, we'll complete the questions and we'll turn it back to Eric. Eric Boyer Thanks, operator. Thanks, Lance. We thank you for your interest in IHS Markit.

We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Ola Fadahunsi at 212-438-2296. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug. Doug Peterson  Thank you, Chip. Welcome to today's earnings call. At the beginning of the quarter we knew that the earnings in the second quarter of 2020 had been very strong due to a surge in liquidity driven investment grade issuance and from management actions we took to reduce spending to deal with the incredible uncertainty from the COVID pandemic. It’s remarkable that the financial results we reported today surpassed those of a year ago. These results don't just happen, our people make them happen and I want to thank them all.  Now, let's turn to our second quarter financial highlights. We reported very strong financial results with revenue increasing 8% and all four businesses delivering revenue and adjusted operating profit growth. Indices delivered the strongest revenue growth based on the large gains in ETF, AUM.  Adjusted expense growth was higher than normal at 9%, largely due to significant cost controls in the prior period due to the pandemic and increased performance related incentives this quarter. After raising guidance on our first quarter earnings call, we're raising 2021 guidance again based on these strong results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Ewout will provide details in a moment.  I'd also like to share some additional highlights from the second quarter. The most important initiative of the year continues to be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit. This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our company and our customers. Momentum for the merger with IHS Markit continues to build. Countless employees from both companies are working together on numerous integration planning workstreams.  We continue to engage with global regulators in anticipation of closing the merger in the fourth quarter of 2021. While we don’t have any new updates on the merger to share with you today, I can assure you that considerable progress is being made.  The iconic Dow Jones industrial average celebrated 125 years this quarter, and we introduced several new ESG related products. We’ll provide further details on these accomplishments on today's call.  And finally, CRISIL named Amish Mehta as the new Managing Director and CEO effective October 1. Amish joined CRISIL as President and Chief Financial Officer in 2014 and assumed his current responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer in 2017. He has over two decades of diverse experience across telecommunications, oil and gas, and business advisory services. Amish will succeed Ashu Suyash, who has decided to move on to set up her own venture. Over the last 6 years, Ashu has led CRISIL’s transformation to become its leading, agile, innovative global analytics company. Under her leadership CRISIL has not only consolidated its ratings leadership position, but also grown its global business. Ashu has been at the forefront of the ESG agenda for CRISIL and the launch of several new offerings and platforms in India and the global markets. I'd like to express our deep appreciation of Ashu’s leadership and contributions.  To recap the financial results for the second quarter, revenue increased 8% to $2.1 billion. Our Adjusted operating profit increased 8% and our adjusted operating profit margin declined 40 basis points to 58.3%. As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on a trailing four quarter basis, which increased 90 basis points to 54.5%. As a result, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 6%. Each quarter we highlight a few key business drivers and important projects underway. This quarter let's start with ratings bond issuance trends.  During the second quarter global bond issuance decreased 9%. In the U.S. bond issuance in aggregate decreased 19% as investment grade decreased 51%. High yield decreased 8%, public finance decreased 7%, while structured finance increased 229% due to large increases in every category, particularly CLOs which increased 580%.  European bond issuance decreased 11% as investment grade decreased 32%, high yield increased 104% and structured finance increased 74% with gains in every asset class except ABS, a particular note where CLOs which increased more than 300%.  In Asia, bond issuance increased 8% overall. The data on this slide only depicts bond issue, where we include bank loan volumes and overall global issuance decreased 2%. One of the first questions investors ask whenever there's a strong quarter of issuance is, how much of this was pull-forward. On this slide we show the profile of bond maturity data from different points in time. As you can see, the upcoming maturities in the second half of this year and in the next few years have not changed much in the past six months. So despite the flurry of issuance in the last few months, there doesn't appear to have been much pull forward activity.  Since bank loan ratings are an important element of ratings revenue and they are not included in our bond issuance slide, we like to disclose our bank loan rating revenue each quarter. The bank loan market continues to see strong demand amid the reopening of the economy, and the vaccination rollout, as potential inflation puts the floating rate asset class in focus.  With an incredibly strong CLO market and retail investors continuing to pour money into loans ETS and mutual funds, the market has easily digested these elevated volumes. In fact, assets at leverage loan funds jumped to an 18 month high at the end of June. All of this is contributed to an unprecedented level of bank loan rating revenue this year with the first half of 2021 already exceeding all last year. Second quarter revenue was $157 million, more than triple the second quarter of 2020.  The next two slides look at the combined high yield issuance and leveraged loan volume for the U.S. and Europe. Data is not readily available for the rest of the world. This slide shows that the combination of global leverage loan and high yield issuance in the first and second quarters of 2021 has dramatically exceeded any quarterly total in the past three years. This slide depicts the combination of high yield issuance and leverage loan volume by the use of proceeds of the funds raised. The category with the largest increase in the second quarter was M&amp;A and LBO activity. The leverage loan market and the CLO market are dependent on one and another as many of the leverage loans end up in CLOs. The CLO market continued with a torrid pace in the second quarter. Investor demand for floating rate investments, their search for yield, and the relatively strong CLO performance during the 2020 pandemic have contributed to increased CLO issuance this year.  There are not a lot of companies in the world still selling a product they created 125 years ago, but on May 26, 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was launched. Still serving as Wall Street’s bellwether at the end of 2020, $37 billion of ETS AUM was indexed or benchmarked against this iconic Dow Jones Index.  At the time of the Dow's introduction, investing in the stock market was considered highly speculative activity, and so in its early years the Dow achieved little prominence outside of Wall Street. Ironically it was the market crash of 1929 that brought the Dow’s reputation to the attention of everyday investors, as the Index lost nearly 30% of its value over the course of two days. Before that investors have been more focused on their individual stock, but after the crash investors were more interested in following general market conditions. The Dow made that possible.  Each year S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices releases the annual survey of assets. This chart depicts the highlights of that survey for 2020. Asset levels in actively managed funds that benchmark against our Indices increased 23% to $11.4 trillion. Assets in passive funds invested in products index to our Indices increased 17% to $7.5 trillion. Numerous Indices support the $7.5 trillion, including the S&amp;P 500, the largest with $5.4 trillion in assets.  There are several other notable categories with considerable AUM growth, including sector Indices that increased 24%; global Indices has increased 62% and fixed income Indices which grew 86%. Just over a year ago we featured the launch of the S&amp;P Global Market place on our earnings call. Today I'd like to share with you the tremendous reception it has received by our clients.  The site currently features 139 tiles of content and solutions, representing all four divisions and Kensho. So far we have booked 189 deals and there have been 600,000 page views. We also recently launched Marketplace workbench in partnership with Databricks, allowing clients access to a modern cloud based platform for big data testing analysis. This slide also depicts the most popular categories and the client types with the most active users.  Congratulations to all those involved in creating a site that uses unique technology to simplify our clients ability to identify, access, evaluate and utilize unique data and solutions. If you haven't visited marketplace.spglobal.com yet, I encourage you to do so.  Turning to our investments in ESG, we continue to launch new products and grow our ESG franchise across the company. After recording ESG revenue of $65 million in 2020, we delivered revenue of $43 million in the first half of this year, with second quarter revenue increased over 50% to $22 million versus the prior period. With the launch of social and sustainability framework alignment opinions that we introduced on our call last quarter, ratings now has four products. Overall ratings completed 13 ESG evaluations, 11 green evaluations, 16 SAM Benchmark Engagements and 10 social and sustainability framework alignment opinions in the quarter.  Market Intelligence launched Electric Quarterly Reports tracking U.S. power purchase agreements. These provide our clients with broad new insights in how energy revenues and renewable power purchase agreement pricing are trending.  Market intelligence also entered into an agreement by Trucost, carbon and environmental data to State Street's clients. These clients will access functionality, including mapping carbon footprint and other environmental data to portfolios, TCFT reporting features, applying Trucost carbon's earnings at risk, Paris Alignment and physical risk data intelligence.  We launched a climate credit analytics product and partnership with Oliver Wyman to help banks comply with climate stress testing regulations, and we launched an SFDR data solution that allows firms operating in the European Union to meet newly formed sustainable finance disclosure regulation requirements by drawing on a wide range of ESG data sets from across S&amp;P Global.  In indices with $25.8 billion of ESG ETF AUM at the end of the second quarter, this is an increase of 290% since the end of the second quarter of last year. Our indices business also launched ESG Dividend Aristocrats Index series partnered with Evolve for the launch of index ETFs that offset the carbon footprint of stocks, and worked with the German Federal Pension Plan that relocated €9 billion of assets to equity indices, utilizing our EU climate transition benchmark.  Platts began publishing daily carbon credit price assessments, reflecting nature based carbon credit and household device carbon credit projects that are intended to bring additional transparency to carbon prices in carbon trading activity. Platts launched the world's first daily carbon neutral LNG price assessment which involves offsetting the carbon emissions through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits. Platts also strengthened its global suite of hydrogen prices, with new hydrogen price assessments for the UK and the new two degree warming scenario to the market leading global integrated energy model.  Let me now turn to our outlook for global issuance in GDP. After issuance growth of 15% in 2019 and 17% in 2020, our ratings research groups prior 2021 forecast called for a decrease of 2%. The latest forecast was issued earlier this week and calls for a decrease of 1% without international public finance. The level of issuance in 2020 remains an aggregate hard to beat, but the 2021 total should still come in at a historically high total likely surpassing 2019.  The two largest changes compared to the forecast last quarter include structured finance, which went from a 6% gain to a 20% gain and non-financial which went from a 7.5% decrease to a 12% decrease. Please note that this is a bond issuance forecast. This is not a revenue forecast. For example, it doesn't address non-transaction revenue and doesn't include leverage loan activity. The peak of the pandemic appears to be behind us, particularly for the most advanced economies as vaccinations become widely available, severe COVID-19 cases fall and economies reopen, but we still see inevitable fits and starts with COVID risk still elevated. This is happening earlier and faster than previously assumed, driving both growth and inflation.  The macro outlook continues to improve. We have raised our global growth forecast by 40 basis points to 5.9% in 2021. This reflects stronger performance across the board in the first half of the year. Our 2022 to 2024 outlook shows a stronger U.S., but lagging emerging markets.  Risks are shifting from the pandemic to the pace of the recovery. In particular, rising inflation in the U.S. and some emerging markets points to a possible bumpy transition from the ultra-low rates and easy financing conditions to the post COVID-19 steady state, and with economies on the mend, policy normalization and sustainability are coming into sharper focus.  Finally, Platts is forecasting the oil will remain above $65 a barrel through 2021.This is positive for the health of the oil industry.  I will now turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout. Ewout Steenbergen Thank you. Let me start with our second quarter financial results. Dough covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items.  Although there were some modest divestitures since the second quarter of 2020, the revenue associated with them, was not large enough to result in a difference between reported and organic revenue growth. Adjusted total expenses increased 9% and I'll provide some additional color on this in the next slide.  Our net interest expense declined 20% due to the refinancing of a substantial portion of our debt last year. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was due to an increase in taxes on foreign operations and the successful resolution of tax examinations in the prior year. Our full year tax rate guidance remains unchanged.  Our adjusted expense growth during the quarter was larger than normal at 9%, there are several reasons. First, second quarter 2020 expenses were impacted by pandemic related management actions taken last year. Second, due to strong financial results year-to-date, performance related costs, including incentives, commissions and royalties have increased. Third, ForEx increased expenses. Finally, I want to make it clear that our business as usual expenses remain under control.  During the quarter changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.03. The only meaningful impact was in ratings, where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $15 million.  Last quarter we introduced three new categories to provide insights into the type of expenses that are going to be incurred related to the pending merger. The first category is transaction costs. These are cost related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees.  The second category is integration cost, these are costs to operationalize the integration; they include consulting, infrastructure and retention cost. The third category is cost to achieve. These are cost needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease termination, severance, contract exit fees and investments related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements.  During the second quarter the non-GAAP adjustments collectively totaled to a net pre-tax loss of $75 million. They included $9 million for merger transaction costs, primarily legal fees; $39 million for merger integration costs, primarily consulting fees, $2 million for cost to achieve, a $3 million lease impairment and $22 million in deal-related amortization, and there was a after tax adjustments with respect to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities related to a U.K. Income Tax Rate change.  This quarter all four divisions delivered increased revenue and adjusted operating profit. On a trailing four quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased significantly in Platts and market intelligence, while ratings had a modest gain and Indices had a decrease of 100 basis points. I'll provide color on the individual business results in a moment.  Now, turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet has low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $5.2 billion, debt of $4.1 billion and undrawn revolver capacity of $1.5 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8x.  Free cash flow excluding certain items was $1.6 billion in the first half of 2021, an increase of more than $100 million or 8% over the prior year period. Due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, share repurchases have been suspended.  Now, let's turn to the division results. Ratings revenue increased to 7%, strong investment grade comps were more than offset by strength in bank loan ratings, structured finance and loan transaction activity. Adjusted expenses increased to 10%, primarily due to increased incentives, salaries and ForEx. These resulted in a 5% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 100 basis points decrease in adjusted segment operating profit margin.  On a trailing four quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 63.4%. Please keep in mind that the 68.1% adjusted segment operating profit margin achieved in the second quarter is temporarily elevated based on the surge of issuance in high yields, leveraged loans and structured finance. In China we see continued momentum and interest in our ratings. We completed 13 ratings in the second quarter and 31 in the first half of 2021 compared to ‘22 in all last year.  Loan transaction revenue increased 19%, primarily due to a more than tripling and new entity ratings revenue, growth in fees associated with surveillance and rating evaluation service revenue that more than doubled due to height of levels of M&amp;A activity. Investors search for yields and increased risk appetite continues to enable weaker credits to raise debt. Transaction revenue decreased with a substantial decline in investment grade bond issuance from last year's record quarter, mostly offset by an increase in bank loan ratings activity, structured finance and high yield bonds issuance.  This slide depicts ratings revenue by its end markets, the largest contributor to the increase in ratings revenue of the 86% increase in structured finance driven by CLOs, ABS, CMBS and RMBS. In addition, corporates declined 2%, financial services revenue increased 4%, governments increased 5% and the CRISIL and other category increased 12%.  Turning to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the segment delivered a 16% revenue growth, primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our Indices. In the second quarter adjusted expenses increased 19%, largely due to increased incentives, salaries, royalties and new product investments. The adjusted segment operating profit increased 15% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 80 basis points to 71.1%. On the trailing four quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin remains strong, but decreased 100 basis points to 69.2%.  Revenue, growth was mixed this quarter. Asset linked fees increased 28%, primarily from gains in ETFs, augmented by smaller gains in mutual funds and insurance and over the counter derivatives activity. Exchange-aided derivative revenue decreased 20% on reduced trading volumes. The second quarter of last year had elevated volatility related to the pandemic and the stock market recovery. Data and custom subscriptions increased 11%.  While the prominence of our U.S. Indices is widely understood, we have been partnering with exchanges around the world to expand our international presence. These include relationships with exchanges in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Korea and others. This chart is a new disclosure that depicts the steady progress we are making to grow revenue in these markets. The revenue is split across asset linked fees and data and custom subscriptions.  For our Indices division, over the past year ETS net inflows were $173 billion and market appreciation totaled $653 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.4 trillion, which is 51% higher compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 56% year-over-year. Sequentially versus the end of first quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $64 billion and market appreciation totaled $158 billion.  As I just noted, exchange-rated derivative revenue faced a strong comparison. Nevertheless, activity at the CBOE increased in the second quarter with S&amp;P 500 Index options activity increasing 8% and VIX futures &amp; options activity increasing 43%. Activity at the CME equity complex decreased 12%.  And here is another new disclosure. You have seen that the revenue from exchange-rated derivative activity can be very volatile from quarter-to-quarter, what I don't think is apparent is the strong underlying annual growth that has taken place. This chart depicts a 7-year CAGR of 9%. While the trend line is not perfectly upward sloping, the annual growth is much more consistent than the quarterly figures might suggest.  Market intelligence delivered revenue growth of 8%, more than one third of the revenue growth was from recent product investments, which increased by more than 40%. This was primarily from ESG, 451 Research, Panjiva, S&amp;P Global Marketplace, after market research and SME data.  Adjusted expenses increased 6%, primarily due to cost of sales and royalties. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 11% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 35.4%. On the trailing four quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 33.4%.  Looking across the Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each categories. Desktop revenue grew 5%; Data Management Solutions revenue grew 13% and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 10%.  And now turning to Platts, reported revenue increased 9%, an uplift over recent quarters. Our core subscriptions increased 9%, including about $2 million in benefits from the timing of contract renewals. It is notable that more than one quarter of the growth came from new products including ESG and LNG.  Oil prices and commodity prices in general are at a level where most of our customers can profitably operate. Global trading services increased 4%, mainly due to strong LNG and petroleum volumes, partially offset by lower natural gas volumes. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, primarily due to incentives, growth initiatives, and commissions, and the adjusted segment operating profit increased 8%.  Adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 57.9%. The trailing four quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 170 basis points to 55.9%. While petrochemicals was the fastest growing category this quarter, every category delivered meaningful growth.  And one final new disclosure: Here you can see the impressive revenue growth that global trading services has delivered over the past 10 years. While this category is volatile from quarter-to-quarter, it has demonstrated a 10 year CAGR of 18%. We're not providing 2021 GAAP guidance because given the inherent uncertainty around the meager, management cannot reliably predict all the necessary components of GAAP measures.  And this slide depicts our adjusted guidance, while we expect that the merger will occur in the fourth quarter of this year, we're providing adjusted guidance on a standalone basis. The third column shows our new 2021 adjusted guidance with all the line items that changed highlighted. We are making these changes because we now expect greater revenue growth, primarily due to improved outlooks in ratings and Indices. Therefore our revenue guidance is increased from a mid-single digit increase to a high single digit increase. Corporate Unallocated is decreased by $5 million to a new range of $135 million to $145 million due to less projects spending than originally anticipated.  Operating profit margin is increased by 40 basis points to a new range of 54.4% to 54.9%, and this results in a $0.40 increase to adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $12.95 to $13.15. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased by $100 million to a range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion.  In conclusion, 2021 is turning out to be a very strong year for the company. All our businesses are delivering solid growth. We continue to expand our ESG product offerings and we are very excited about the upcoming merger with IHS Markit.  With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.  Chip Merritt  Thank you. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. To indicate that you wish to ask a question please press star one and record your name. To cancel or withdraw your question, simply press star two. Please limit yourself to two questions in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&amp;A session.  Operator, we will now take our first question.  Question-and-Answer Session  Operator Thank you, Mr. Merritt. Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.  Manav Patnaik Thank you. Good morning. I guess just my first question is around you know your ESG efforts. So the $22 million you called out this quarter, growing 50% I think, is that all the products that fall under this new Sustainable1 brand than you have? And can you just talk about you know whether, what’s your annual forecast for that might look like just given the high growth rate?  Dough Peterson Good morning, Manav. This is Doug. Thank you for joining the call today, and thanks for the question. As you know we're very excited about what we're have been doing with ESG. It’s an area where we see a lot of growth, a lot of interest from our customers and when we put together Sustainable1 for us, this is an ability. It provides us ability to look across the entire portfolio and provide the services and products that are being issued and being demanded by our customers, so they can manage their own positions.  As you know, we have products across ratings, ESG evaluations, Indices. Last year our Indices grew 290% of ESG AUM up to $25.8 billion. Across market intelligence we launch the Climate Credit Analytics which are being used by banks, by risk managers, by asset managers to look at the portfolio impact of climate. In Platts we have a whole suite of price assessments, voluntary carbon markets has just been launched as well as carbon neutral LNG.  So we see high demand in the market. We are having great engagement with our customers. We continue to develop new products and in particular around climate. This is an area where with our original acquisition of Trucost, we were able to bring in place a really strong set of climate analytics, including a person named Richard Mattison who is the Founder of Trucost, who is now the president of Sustainable1 which is our ESG business model, which is reporting to Martina Cheung. So we're very pleased with the progress, but let me hand it over to Ewout to talk a little bit more about the numbers. Ewout Steenbergen Manav with respect to the results, these are the complete results for our ESG operation across the company. So we have built a horizontal P&amp;L, where it includes all of our activities for ESG and all of our decisions. If you look at the growth so far this year, first quarter growth was 64%, second quarter 53%. We still expect that this year total revenues will end up approximately at $100 million and then for 2024 the forecast is that it will exceed $300 million in total ESG revenue. So we're growing very rapidly and we're quite positive about the outlook.  Manav Patnaik Got it. And then you know just a quick question on the readings margins. You know you talked about how it’s elevated for the different categories. But you know just maybe on a multi-year outlook. Like you know how should we think about what the – what are the different factors that will drive the continued margin expansion of you know pretty healthy levels today? Ewout Steenbergen I don’t know, with respect to the ratings margins I would like to point you at the trailing fourth quarter, fourth quarter margins that were at 63.4%, up 30 basis points. We have seen a very large increase in the margins and ratings last year, 460 basis points, and for the full year, the best direction I can give to you is think about margin for the full year in line with where we are for a trailing four quarter basis.  From a longer term perspective we don't have new aspirational margin targets for our divisions. We think the right moment to announce those is after completion of the merger with IHS Markit. But a couple of factors that you have to take into consideration, of course there continue to be positive secular trends behind the ratings business, as long as CDP is going up and we see positive economic momentum, the early positive revenue growth for the ratings business. Also of course all our businesses have always operating leverage, so operating leverage will be a benefit. We do think over time we need to invest in some analytical capacity because of the level of volumes that we're seeing, but that's a good problem to have. So, so many investments need to be made in analytical capacity. So that is the best I can give to you with respect to the outlook, but overall I would say very strong results by the ratings business and really topping a very strong year last year.  Manav Patnaik Got it, thank you.  Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Sir, you may ask your question. Jeff Silber Thank you so much. I wanted to shift gears over to China. Obviously there's been a lot of news over the past few weeks. I think it was a new data security law that you know was going to affect it a couple of months and then we’ve just seen more broader risk in a number of different industries. Can you talk about you know what's going out there and the implications it might have for your business? Doug Peterson Thank you, Jeff. Yeah, we have – as you know we built a domestic rating agency in China. Two years ago when we launched that we had a decision to go with a wholly owned subsidiary. In addition we've been expanding our business with market intelligence on the ground as well, building an on-shore China business.  We understand that the new data security law which is going to be going into place in September is related to managing domestic information. Since we've been building our businesses on-shores, domestic on-shore businesses, we think that we’ll be able to meet the requirements of the domestic law, so the data security law for on-shore businesses should – we should be able to meet those requirements because we're building new businesses from scratch and they are on-shore businesses. Related to the general business environment, clearly there's a lot of noise at the macro level between the United States and China; we pay attention to that very closely. But at the financial services sector we still see very open regulators. They are open to bringing in foreign players into the market. We continue to see foreign banks and foreign asset managers get licenses of 51% to 100% owned licenses and we continue to get excellent reception in the market for our domestic Chinese ratings business.  Jeff Silber Okay, that's helpful. And just keeping with the regulatory theme and may be shifting back to the U. S., you know we've seen some announcements out of Washington in terms of some greater scrutiny on mergers. Are you seeing any additional pressure in terms of the info merger and can you also just remind us what the milestones we need to be looking out for before the deal closes? Thanks.  A - Doug Peterson Yes, thank you on that. As you know we're obviously engaged right now very, very – almost continuously with the regulators for our own merger. It's a very constructive dialogue engagement that we’re having with them, and when it comes to what we're seeing ourselves, our merger is really about combining two very complementary businesses. We're engaged with the anti-trust regulators and have proposed a divestiture of inflows, opus [ph] and coal businesses are based on that feedback, but we don't really see any major roadblocks are coming up in our way, but we do continue to track the environment very closely and we do continue to expect that the transaction will close in the fourth quarter of this year.  Jeff Silber Okay, great. Thank you so much. A - Doug Peterson Thanks.  Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. You may ask your question. Craig Huber Yes, hi! You went out of your way to talk about the lack of pull-forward in this – given this, despite the strong debt issuance you recently took. Can you talk if you would Doug about the future here in terms of debt issuance and obviously the stock, the total amount of debt outstanding that has grown significantly here. How does that make you feel going forward, for your ratings business going forward, given how strong our yield has been here recently and we have few quarters of record, investment grade here over the last year and stuff. I mean how optimistic are you going forward with your ratings business?  A - Doug Peterson This is something that obviously we watch very closely, and this last quarter had some of the largest swings I've ever seen since I've been in this company, of different asset classes of issuance.  As an example, in the U.S. corporates were down 63% year-on-year of issuance; Europe was down 35% and corporate investment grade globally was down 26%, although high yield was up 27%. You saw some of the numbers. CLO’s were up almost 500% globally, 580% in the U.S. So we saw a lot of swings, but we take a step back and we look at a few really important factors for going forward on the issuance, both for what’s going to be the rest of the year, which we mentioned we expect will be down about 1% for total issuance and I’ll come back to that in a second.  But we look at economic growth which is starting to become very robust. We do think it will level out and once we get through the pandemic, but at a pretty robust level for the U.S., Europe and Asia, that's beneficial for us. Once debt goes on to balance sheet as bonds or as rated loans, it typically continues to be a rated loan or a rated bond, so we see that the pipeline of that that’s been increasing.  In addition we watch things like mergers and acquisitions which are very robust right now, which are helping the current environment, especially for high yield and loans. But when you look at the ability for markets around the world to shift from being bank markets to capital markets, you look at overall economic growth, you look at low interest rates which we expect are going to continue for some time in the major developed markets. These are all things that are beneficial for our long term outlook for ratings. Since you did ask the questions very briefly on 2021 forecast, we expect that the overall market is going to be down about 1% last quarter. We said that was going to be down about 2%, so that's a short term view that doesn't include loans, which we still think are also going to be robust for the rest of the year.  Craig Huber My follow-up question if I could ask. The market intelligence was very strong. You were obviously up 8% organically; I haven’t seen a number like that in quite a while, and obviously it tells me that the underlying health of your end markets there, your customers there is quite good. Can you maybe comment on that and also what's driving that strong growth and I think it's – we’ll continue here. Thanks.  A - Ewout Steenbergen Right, we saw the growth across the market intelligence product lines. Desktop as you’ve seen 5% growth. You recall last quarter the growth in desktop was a bit lower and we told you that that would just be temporary and we're happy to see it coming back to mid-single digit growth. Also the data management solutions and credit risk solutions grew a bit faster than what we would expect from a longer term perspective. Overall what we're seeing is healthy commercial activities and sales levels during the second quarter, particularly sales to U. S. corporate has been very strong and we also have seen very strong renewals in our book of business. So overall book of business growing very well, active users going up by 10% and I think it's overall reflection of the positive economic environment that we're in at the moment.  Craig Huber Great! Thank you.  Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. You may ask your question.  Trevor Romeo Hey, good morning. This is Trevor Romeo on for Andrew. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I just kind of wanted to touch on Platts. It was nice to see the revenue growth acceleration there. I know you mentioned $2 million came from contract timing, but it still seem like a nice you know kind of sequential increase in the past few quarters. So was just wondering if you could spend you know a minute or two diving a bit deeper into the growth drivers there and kind of how sustainable that is going forward.  A - Doug Peterson Good morning, Trevor. Definitely one of the stronger quarters in terms of revenue growth of Platts over the last few years, and if you take that $2 million matter out from a timing perspective, you still see very significant growth, driven by strong commercial momentum in the quarter and insight’s businesses, but also the global trading services volumes are growing. What we are seeing in general is our customers are getting healthier with the current commodity prices. But clearly the commodity price environment is helping our customers and that is ultimately also helping to grow of the Platts business.  Trevor Romeo Got it, thanks. And then on the indices segment, I've noticed a few recent announcements related to I guess kind of new S&amp;P cryptocurrency indices. So I was just kind of wondering if you could broadly talk about your long term vision for those types of indices and how you're thinking about the size of that opportunity. Thank you.  Doug Peterson Thanks Trevor. Well first of all, we are looking at the cryptocurrency market and digital finance more broadly than just indices. We don't necessarily have a clear strategy toward particularly there yet, but it's something that we see growing for opportunities for research and analytics and other things around that, but we started it with the index business. The market for cryptocurrency assets, it's growing. You can see that there's a lot of interest in it and this also goes beyond just crypto into obviously as well blockchain.  We announced the first indices in partnership using the data pricing from a company called Luka that we have an investment in. It's a New York based company that provides data and analytics, as well as crypto asset software. We have launched since then a few different indices, eight to-date. There's an S&amp;P bitcoin, S&amp;P Ethereum; we have a cryptocurrency mega cap index and a couple that provide broad index, which includes values from over 240 coins.  We have a team that is looking at this quite carefully in addition to using some of our expertise from Kensho to analyze the trends in the market. We think that this is going to become an asset class that over time would potentially become more acceptable to investors. We see that many of the major financial institutions have started trading desks or businesses around this.  So this is an area we will continue to invest to grow in it. It's quite small right now and I don't have enough ability to give you any market sizing or pricing on it yet, because this is really a brand new market.  Trevor Romeo Alright, well thank you both for the detail. A - Doug Peterson Thanks Trevor.  Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open sir. Jeff Meuler Yes, thank you. I guess I was surprised by how strong ratings, non-transactional revenue was in the quarter and how much it accelerated in a slightly down ratings environment. I was hoping you could talk through how mix is impacting I guess ratings non-transactional revenue and how sustainable the growth is.  A - Ewout Steenbergen Yes, we have seen growth in non-transaction by all the underlying components, so that's the reason why you saw such a strong growth in the non-transaction this quarter, so let me expend a bit on that.  So, one component is new entity credit ratings. It's about one-third of the eligible growth in non-transaction that came from new entity credit ratings. Another one-third of the growth came from surveillance and that's being held by the larger number of bonds outstanding based on the search of issuance last year. And then the rest is a build-up of ratings evaluation services driven by the M&amp;A, the positive M&amp;A environment that Doug already explained, program fees and also the CRISIL results were very strong this quarter. So you could say all the underlying components were really pointing to a positive direction. What I can say is in terms of outlook for the full year, for non-transaction we are now expecting high single digit growth in this category.  Jeff Meuler Right, thank you for that. And then just given the marketplace slide and what I would think would be a good opportunity post-merger close, if you could help me understand, to what extent is this NIC like the most active user categories. But to what extent is market place expanding your reach into new customer relationships? To what extent is it increasing your relationships with existing and how important are the partnerships, I think Snowflake and now Databricks to the go-to-market versus (a) I guess internal go-to-market effort?  Doug Peterson Yeah, thanks Jeff. Yeah, this is really an important part of our – if you want to call it our distribution and client engagement strategy across the company. We realized a few years ago that our customers, that the use cases were going to be shifting and that the different profiles of the users; our businesses were going to be shifting; more people are going to be using models and modeling; they are going to be wanting to get data that have been curated, it had been cleaned, it was easy to use, and then we realized over the last couple of years as we started launching that, that there are many users that also would like to have tools that they could quickly analyze data or even directly link it into their own data. So this is where Databricks and Snowflake come in. We’ve added as you see – we are now 169 different titles with ESG and credit analytics and some other data market data being the most highly used so far. When it comes to our customers, the profile of the personas that are using it are slightly different, but they are the same customers. So it's a lot of corporate customers, hedge funds, asset managers, risk managers, inside financial institutions. So many times its similar types of customers that we already have, but its different profiles and personas inside of those customers that are using this new data and these new analytical tools.  We see a lot of people using Python when they bring the data over into their own systems to do a data science analytics, but it's something that we're quite excited about and we're also learning. We get a lot of ideas from our – directly from our clients, of new ways to enhance it or new data sets that they'd like to see it included in it. But we're really pleased with the results of this. I would recommend that everybody go take a look at it. If this was a call that Chip Merritt could have a chance to share a screen, he would, and he’d show us all of the different opportunities you have to use data for what you're actually doing in your jobs every day, and thanks for the question. Jeff Meuler Thank you both.  Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Ashish Sabadra Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a solid quarter. My question was on product innovation. You highlighted one-third of the revenue growth in market intelligence, as well as a quarter of revenue growth in Platts coming from new products and we’ve seen acceleration or revenue growth acceleration in both those businesses. My question was how do you think about product innovation post info-merger with more incremental data and capabilities? How do you think about durability to innovate going forward? Thanks.  A - Doug Peterson Ashish, we are really excited about the opportunity to even further accelerate our product innovation together with IHS Markit, because you know our strategy if you take a few steps backwards. Our strategy is we are growing in our core businesses because of positive secular trends, but then we would like to grow in addition to that based on all the new product innovation and we're investing in that now for the last two, three years. We have a very specific investment program and we're very happy that this year you are seeing some of the clear benefits coming out of it in growth in our segments and some of the growth items that you already pointed out.  With HIS Markit, actually we believe we are even better positioned for future growth, because we are strengthening three of our four divisions and those locations will be very complementary in terms of nature of activities that are coming together. And then on top of it we will also grow even more in the growth adjacencies, the markets around ESG, energy transition, private company data, the third party assessments and so on, so even the growth adjacencies will be stronger positioned to grow in the future based on the combined company.  So actually it's one of the key reasons why we are doing this merger, because the combined company, now if we can grow faster than the two companies we’ll be able to achieve standalone.  Ashish Sabadra That's very helpful color. And maybe just a quick question on cost synergies, particularly post info-merger; you have obviously given that target. But in addition both S&amp;P and Info independently were pursuing cost take out initiatives. So post the merger how should we think about it? Would you plan to combine all of that and also any update that you can provide on S&amp;Ps independent cost take out synergies, the cost take out initiatives. Thanks.  A - Doug Peterson Overall, I see all of those productivity programs are moving forward. In a way we're making a lot of good progress. A couple of the questions you asked, let me break those down. So first the S&amp;P global productivity program that we have to-date, $120 million productivity program, we are planning to give you an update either during the third or the fourth quarter earnings call. We would like to do that update as close as possible to the completion of the merger, so that you know how far we have been able to come on a standalone basis. But what I can say is we were at $49 million at the end of last year and we're making very significant progress this year with respect to that program. I can’t talk too much about IHS Markit, but they have a stated productivity and efficiency program to expand margins by 100 basis points every year. Of course that will be all combined into synergies and expense synergies that we are going to achieve after the completion of the transaction. I cannot give you any update on those numbers. What we have said is we will come back to you if appropriate after the completion of the transaction with updates, if we have any updates to those numbers.  But clearly we are working in the integration planning and further substantiating and supporting those synergy numbers from a bottoms-up perspective and we are getting more and more comfortable over time with respect to those numbers. The expectation is that then the combined company in the future will be able to expand margins by 200 basis points for the first few years, so all of those commitments are still in place.  Ashish Sabadra That's very helpful color. Thanks once again and congrats on such a solid quarter. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thank you.  Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. George Tong Hi! Thanks, good morning. You’re forecasting 2021 global debt issuance to decline 1% excluding loans. Can you discuss your outlook for the individual debt categories, including loans and how you expect the evolving macro interest rate environment to impact issuance?  A - Ewout Steenbergen Yeah, thanks George. So first of all let me go through the components then of that 1% down. We look at the corporates and we corporates so far are down this year about 12% overall as I mentioned earlier so far this year, and corporates they are down 40% in the second quarter. But we expect that overall they are going to be down about 12%, so that's that category. Financial services have actually been a little bit more robust than we had originally expected. We thought they were going to be up about 4%, but we think it'll go up as high as 10%, but our mid-point is about 7.5%. Just as an anecdote on that, the last quarter Bank of America issued $28 billion, JP Morgan issued $23 billion. It looks like the banks are starting to use their balance sheets again and in Europe all of the largest, of the 10 largest issuers in Europe that were all in the $4 billion to $6 billion range, almost all of those with the exception of one were a financial institution, so we think financial issues will be up for the year.  Structured finance we think will be up about 20% for the year. We see that the structured finance market is still going quite strong. As we mentioned in the second quarter, it was up over 147% overall. We don't think that that pace will continue in structured finance, but we see it up 20%. We originally said in our prior forecast it would be up about 6% in 2021 as opposed to now raising it to 20%.  We look at public finance. We still think that’s going to be down about 5%. Public finance issuers have not been as active. If there is an infrastructure program approved in Washington and we do see a revitalization of infrastructure investment in the U. S., public finance will probably go along with that. So overall we see bond issuance down about 1% when you add up all of that up together.  We think that loans are going to continue to be strong. I don't have a specific number for the year what they are going to be up, but they will continue to be up. You saw the numbers of how strong they've been compared to prior years, but the pipeline is strong, the M&amp;A pipeline is strong.  When it comes to interest rates, interest rates are still quite low. Spreads are low and interest rates are low. Spreads are not at the lowest they’ve ever been, but they are close to low areas, especially after the spike that we saw last year in the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter when the pandemic first started. So we do think that there's going to be a lot of strength in loans and then subsequently from that CLOs as well for the rest of the year.  Just one other, one other tidbit; we see that in the ABS area, which is goes between the loans. In ABS we see a lot of activity related to autos, related to corporate banks, corporate restructuring, to their balance sheets, etc. So we still see a lot of activity, interest rate driven, but recall that last year there was a lot of liquidity issuance that was driven by investment grade corporates. That has basically gone away and you saw that from the big drop and that's been substituted now by loans, by structured finance, by ABS, etc. We think that that's going to continue for the rest of the year and then as I mentioned in an earlier question, we see that all of this positions us well for the long run. George Tong Very helpful. You're increasing your guidance for revenue growth to high single digits from mid-single digits previously. Can you elaborate on your latest segment growth expectations for the year, including how much of the upwardly revised guidance reflects Q2 outperformance versus an improved second half outlook?  Ewout Steenbergen George, let me give you the components by each of our segments. I only give you guidance for a full year basis, and I think you probably can derive from that the outlook for the second half of the year. But for ratings, we're now expecting revenue growth at a high single digit level, so that's up from mid-last quarter to now high-single digit.  Market Intelligence is still at a level to mid to high single digits. Platts has gone up from mid to mid-to-high single digit revenue growth, and the index business now we are expecting low double-digit revenue growth that's up from high single digit to low double digits. So three of the four segments were increasing the revenue outlook for the full year, and then also for the company as a whole the revenue outlook has been increased to high single digit growth.  George Tong Very, helpful. Thank you.  Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.  Owen Lau  Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Quick question on Kensho Scribe. I think it was recently launched for commercial use. Could you please talk about the traction there, and then broadly speaking could you please talk about the progress of deploying Kensho into the overall business and what have you learned so far. Thank you.  Ewout Steenbergen Owen, we continue to be very excited about all the Kensho initiatives that are continuing within the company. Kensho, in the meantime has developed a complete AI toolkit for unstructured data with many different elements that are in the toolkit, about entity linking, data extraction, speech-to-text, search, codex and Named Entity Recognition, many other initiatives that have been developed and those tools are being used across the company. Let me give you two specific examples, including the one that you're referring to with respect to Scribe. So Scribe is the speech-to-text algorithm engine, and we are using that for our own businesses. For example, for our earnings call transcripts business, and the more you can teach those algorithms based on the actual activity, the better they become, the stronger is your engine. So all of our activities with respect to our earnings call transcript business is now being done through Kensho Scribe and the quality is really very high at the moment and further improving over time.  That's indeed being sold now also to external customers, so we have a few external customers now that are interested in this engine, because it's one of the best product service that is out there. And so we are actually very excited about the fact that Kensho can help pivot to external customers as well with some of its products.  Let me give you a second example. This is about the market on close in the Platts business. At 26 markets now, this is being implemented and we have reduced 75% of the time between the market close and publishing our prices, which is of course very important for our customers, because the closer that time gap, the better it is for them, 14 markets still to go.  So in other words, Kensho initiatives are continuing and we continue to be very excited about the transformative nature that Kensho is bringing to S&amp;P Global.  Owen Lau  Got it. That's very helpful. And in the follow-up question, something related to the IHS acquisition. But could you please remind us the benefit of owning the data versus like rending the data from S&amp;P point of view. For example can you like create additional products or services by owning that data versus maybe you may not be able to do it by renting that data. Thank you.  Doug Peterson Owen, thank you for the question. When we look at the IHS Markit merger, and when we originally conceived of it and as we continue to go through our analysis to work on our integration planning, we see that there's lots of opportunities across the company. It goes well beyond just the data. There are many different ways that we can have complimentary data usage.  As an example, the fixed income Indices is one of the ones that we talk a lot about, because they have fixed income data, they've got the fixed income business that already exist, they have the reference data. So we can quickly put their Index business together with ours, increase our asset class coverage as well as innovative in new areas like multi asset class indices.  So beyond just the data usage and the data linkage across the company, there's many more opportunities as an example deploying some of IHS Markit software, software tools, workflow tools, things that we don't have as much at S&amp;P Global. Bringing in that expertise into two markets into new markets like ESG, like climate [ph], we’re very excited about things like that.  So the combination goes well beyond data. Data is fundamental to it. Bringing those data together like their Data Lake and our Marketplace, reference data that can be used across our company, that's sort of a nice to have, it's necessary. But beyond that to be sufficient and to really make this exciting, it goes also into analytics, into research, into software tools etc. So we continue to be excited about this and data is fundamental to it, but it goes well beyond that.  Owen Lau  Alright, that’s very helpful. Thank you very much.  Doug Peterson Thanks Owen.  Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. You may ask your questions sir. Kevin McVeigh Thank you so much. Hey! I think you folks did a really nice job talking about kind of the debt cycle overall. Ewout you talked about kind of client searching for yield as you go little bit further down the credit stack. Where are we in that process and then you know how do we reconcile that, because obviously it feels like the bond market’s a lot healthier relative to the last cycle, maybe not as much access. So Doug, does that help offset maybe some of the tougher comps as we push this duration out a little bit. Just any puts and takes around that.  Ewout Steenbergen Yeah, when we look at the debt cycle and we try to see where we are, clearly the interest rates are quite low, but there's a – if you want a thing that’s almost like a supply and demand issue. There's an incredible amount of supply of liquidity, a lot of that liquidity is positioning for a higher rate or an inflationary market, which means that they've moved into floating rate instruments. And so you see a large amount of funds have moved into floating rate instruments, which means that there's a lot of liquidity available for floating rate loans and CLOs. So you can see that there's been a shift of liquidity in that direction.  But we are going to look at this more in the longer run. There is a debt cycle which we're going through right now, but that’s good onto people's balance sheets. There is a large amount of debt issuances. It’s been investment grade and the investment grade has been holding up. The debt levels and interest rate coverage levels are still strong. We've been holding to our standards for what would be an investment grade issuer, and then when you look at the many, many high yield issues that have been coming out, clearly the market understands the risk they're taking when invest in a deep high yield issuance.  But we think that when you look at the – some of the slides that we showed today of the balance sheets, of the maturity schedules which are coming up, this boards well in the long run for the overall markets. That doesn't mean that every single quarter is going to be always be up. We saw this quarter a lot of movements of some very strong growth in some areas, a lot of decreases in others, and we expect that we're going to see that especially as the markets we accommodate.  Kevin McVeigh Super helpful. And then just real quick, on the buyback Ewout, I know you're restricted right now with the deal, but can you just remind us of when you could potentially be back in the market pending deal closure and how we should think about that relative to capital allocation overall?  Ewout Steenbergen Absolutely Kevin! Buybacks, we would probably not be able, most likely not be able to do buybacks before the completion of the merger. Then our thinking at the moment is that after completion of the merger we do a catch-up and the catch-up is in relation to the lost period that we're not able to return capital to our shareholders at some level of our capital targets, at least 75% return of capital targets that we were not able to achieve since the middle of last year, until the fourth quarter of this year.  Also you have to take into account that IHS Markit itself cannot do any share buybacks, so you have to take that in consideration, as well as potential proceeds of some of the divestitures. We’d like to do that catch-up. Of course we would like to go as quickly as possible into the rhythm of our new capital return target of at least 85% of our free cash flow and the combined company will be accompanied that very soon after the completion, we'll get to a level of approximately $5 billion or north of $5 billion of free cash flow, very significant amounts. So we would like to go back into a normal rhythm as quickly as possible.  I can’t give you specific numbers. I know there's a big question on the street about numbers in terms of the buyback and catch-up. I can't give you specific numbers, but philosophically this is the way we’d like to approach this and overall I think we will be in a very good position to get back into our normal rhythm with respect to our capital return targets.  Kevin McVeigh Very helpful, thank you.  Operator Thank you for your question. We will now take our final question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.  Toni Kaplan Thank you. Thanks very much. I was hoping you could give some additional color regarding how you're thinking about any potential benefits from the proposed infrastructure bill.  Doug Peterson Yes, thanks Toni. Well, first of all I'm encouraged to see that there's a bipartisan process going on in Washington around the infrastructure. It’s something that we need in this country, both the bipartisanship, as well as investment and infrastructure.  We think that there will be a few potential benefits from that; the first is just a general economic growth. We have done a lot of research and analysis on infrastructure over the years and infrastructure generally leads to growth beyond just investment and infrastructure itself. We estimate that it’s somewhere about 1.7x to 1.9x additional economic growth that comes from infrastructure.  So when you build an airport, around an airport you get rental cars, you get gas stations, you get activity inside the airport from people buying food and gifts, etc. So we see that there is a potential economic benefit which should help growth, it also helps jobs; all of that helps business climate generally which obviously is beneficial to us.  More specifically, if there is an infrastructure build, we do think that despite much of it being discussed, it’s being funded by the public sector. That there will be opportunities for public private partnerships, which would bring with them a potentially debt financing, the municipal bond market could a take on more activity if there's going to be local investment in infrastructure.  And then the companies themselves, construction companies, the large projects, they're going to need financing as they go through the projects themselves. So we think that this will be in general beneficial to the overall economy. I think it's a good signal from Washington and then overall it could have some benefits to us, in particular for the ratings business.  Toni Kaplan That's helpful. And just looking at our first half Index margins were about 71% and that's typically your highest incremental margin business with margin degradation usually coming from reinvestment. So just thinking about that, how should we think about the medium term targets for margins within Index? Should we sort of build off the low 70s number or are there additional investments that you might want to make that could bring that level down. Thank you.  Ewout Steenbergen Toni, I can give you some guidance for the full year 2021 margins for the Index business, that we expect to be at the high 60s level. If you look at the trailing fourth quarter at level for Index, it was 69.2, so more or less the same margins for the full year as we have today on the trailing four quarter basis.  It’s exactly for the reason that you are mentioning. In fact for a business that is having such a high margins, the best thing you can do from a [inaudible] operation perspective is to grow that business as fast as you can. So investing in new product initiatives we believe is a very positive thing for the index business and that is exactly what we are doing at this point in time.  We are investing in ESG indices, we are investing in Kensho New Economies Indices, and multi-asset class indices, in new capabilities with respect to rapid index development. So overall this level of investments are still relatively modest from a bigger picture perspective, but good investments that should position our index business for future growth.  Toni Kaplan Perfect! Thanks so much. Congrats on the quarter.  Ewout Steenbergen Thank you, Toni.  A - Doug Peterson Thank you. Thanks so much. And thank you everyone for joining the call today and for your support. As you can see, we are very pleased with the performance of this quarter and we are also very excited about all we've been doing at the company and all we can do.  Going back we highlighted today the Dow Jones Index, which was the Dow Jones Industrial Index which is a 125 years old, and at the same time we are bringing brand new innovative research and analytics to the market through what we talked about with Kensho, with ESG evaluations, with Climate Analytics, with the Credit Climate Analytics, with new benchmarks from Platts, with our China expansion, and so we have so much new innovation going on.  We are also exciting about that to see how that’s starts to play out and also highlighted by what we’ve been doing with the market place. But on top of that we are excited about the IHS Markit merger. The process is good. We are very pleased with all of the things we are learning about the company across both teams, especially the quality of the people.  But I want to end by thanking our employees again who have been working under what I would call unusual circumstances. But it’s exciting to start opening up our offices again to see people at the offices, to get a little bit of travel going again. So again, thank you to our employees, thank you everyone on the call and I hope everyone gets at least a little bit of time to enjoy part of the summer. Thanks again.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Eric Boyer. Please go ahead. Eric Boyer Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 2021 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q1 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion in the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers, which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit’s filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Jonathan Gear, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions. With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance. Lance Uggla Thank you, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 earnings calls. We had another very strong quarter. Q2 revenue was $1.18 billion, with organic growth of 13%. Adjusted EBITDA of $517 million and margin of 43.8%, up 30 basis points year-over-year FX adjusted, and up 80 basis points now year-to-date; adjusted EPS up 0.81 or $0.81, up 17% over the prior year. So, overall, we’re pleased with the first half of our year, which puts us in an excellent position to raise our full-year guidance today. In terms of core industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had another strong quarter with 9% organic growth in Q2. Within the division, information performed solidly with organic growth of 5%. Contributors included increased demand for our pricing, reference data, and valuations offerings, as well as continued growth in our equities regulatory reporting and trade and analytics platforms. Solutions had an excellent quarter, with 15% organic growth, and they continue to benefit from robust market activity in equities and loan markets, combined with a broad-based rebound of investment, customers in our software solutions, and our corporate actions and regulatory and compliance offerings. Finally, our processing business grew 6% organically, strengthened loans and derivatives performance as expected. For the full-year, we still expect Financial Services to be in the 7% to 8% organic growth range. Now, moving on to transportation, which had organic revenue growth of 39% in Q2. Now, you'll recall that the basis for comparison, the second quarter of 2020 was depressed by significant pricing concessions that we granted our customers at the height of the COVID-related lockdowns, as well as by particularly challenging trading conditions in the automotive market. However, there is more to this quarter than a low comparison. I'm pleased to say that this quarter’s performance also reflected strong underlying organic growth right across the transportation businesses. Our dealer businesses, that includes CARFAX and Mastermind, are once again experiencing rapid growth. In a retail environment, that's marked by a shortage of inventory both used and new, and by rapidly escalating used car prices, our products are critical to helping the dealers acquire and sell more cars at the right price in the right time. Demand for our predictive solutions, volumes planning, power transmissions compliance, supply chain and technology are all accelerating, as the industry grapples with multiple supply chain disruptions, and as it faces major strategic decisions related to the technology mega trends, those include the connected car, autonomous driving, and electrification. Our marketing audience and measurements business is rapidly expanding its footprint with automotive market tiers. And recently, we announced a wide-ranging partnership with Nielsen, which we are very excited about. And finally, our Maritime &amp; Trade business continued to deliver strong performance. This has been the result of a very focused product strategy and disciplined execution over multiple quarters. We also hosted a successful virtual TPM conference in March. So, for the full-year, we now expect transportation organic growth to be higher, and in the 14% to 16% range, which is up from our previously noted 13% to 15% range. This represents a healthy underlying high single-digit growth rate, excluding the favorable year-over-year comparison due to the pandemic. Moving on to resources, where our organic growth was flat in Q2. Our resources business performance was as expected, with recurring revenue consistent with Q1 and non-recurring revenue benefiting from the return of both CERAWeek and the World Petrochemical Conferences. As expected, our ACV experienced slight positive growth in Q2, which we believe should accelerate in the back half, providing a stronger foundation for our 2022 recurring revenue. Our downstream organic revenue growth performed as expected and should accelerate throughout the rest of the year. Downstream is now 50% of the overall division and upstream 50%. That's a 10% shift year-over-year. In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low single digits as upstream improves and downstream continues its growth trajectory.  Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was in line with our expectations of 1% for the quarter. We expect improving results continue and across CMS throughout the year. For the full-year, we expect CMS to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth. The only update we have on the merger is what S&amp;P Global recently disclosed that we expect the deal to now close in calendar Q4. And now, I'll turn the call over to Jonathan. Jonathan Gear Great. Thank you, Lance. Q2 highlights included revenue organic growth of 13%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 14%, GAAP net income and EPS both had growth of 122%, and adjusted EPS had growth of 17% year-over-year. Regarding revenue, our Q2 revenue was $1.18 billion, with total growth of 15%. Organic growth in the quarter was 13%, which included the current organic growth of 10% and non-recurring organic growth of 41%. This increase was driven by strong underlying growth in financial services and transportation, as well as benefiting from favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the impact of COVID on some of our transportation and resources businesses. Moving on to segment performance, our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 9%, including 7% occurring in the quarter. Solutions, in particular, had strong performance, delivering 15% organic growth, primarily from strength in capital market issuances, corporate actions, and reg and compliant offerings, while information had 5% growth driven by pricing and valuations and our equities, regulatory reporting, and trading analytics platforms. Processing had a 6% organic increase driven by volumes, primarily in loans. Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 39% in the quarter. This included growth of 38% recurring, as Q2 continue to have strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses, and accelerating growth within our Maritime &amp; Trade business. Non-recurring revenue increased by 41%, primarily driven by strong performance in CARFAX, consumer and dealer transactions, core automotive insights and Maritime &amp; Trade events. Our resources segment remained flat, which is comprised with 8% recurring decline and 73% non-recurring increase. Q2 organic ACB increased by 2 million in the quarter, and our trailing 12-month organic ACB is down 8% as we have now cycled through our subscription renewals since the North American energy market was severely impacted at the end of Q1 last year. We had great success with our entirely virtual CERAWeek and World Petrochem Conferences and we continue to see strong demand in our downstream businesses, particularly in our products and services to support energy transition and energy market supply chains. Our CMS segment had 1% organic growth, including 2% recurring and a decrease of 10% non-recurring. Moving now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA was 517 million, up 63 billion versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% with a margin of 43.8% down 40 basis points, and up 30 basis points FX adjusted. Moving to our segments. Financial services adjusted EBITDA was 238 million, with a margin of 48.2% down 320 bips FX adjusted. Financial services margins reflects a return to more normal margin levels post COVID. Transportation’s adjusted EBITDA was 171 billion, with a margin of 49.6%, up 870 bips FX adjusted. We do expect margins to moderate in forward quarters as we see more expense tied to revenue growth. Resources adjusted EBITDA was 91 million with a margin of 41.4%, a decrease of 210 bips FX adjusted as a result of lower revenue. CMS adjusted EBITDA was 29 million, with a margin of 23.3%, down 520 bips FX adjusted. This quarter’s decrease was driven primarily by the return to more normal margins compared to the prior year in addition to a mix shift. We do expect margins to continue to improve in the back half of the year. Moving now to net income and EPS. Net income was 159 million and GAAP EPS was $0.40. Adjusted EPS was $0.81, an increase of 17% over prior year. Our GAAP tax rate was 26%, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%. Q2 free cash flow was 301 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow conversion has increased to 56%. Turning to the balance sheet, our Q2 ending debt balance was 5.0 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.6 times on a bank covenant basis, and 2.5 times net of cash. We closed the quarter with 217 million of cash and our Q2 undrawn revolver balance was approximately 917 million. In the quarter, we paid off our 250 million, 364-day term loan. Our Q2 weighted average diluted share count was [400.7 million] shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&amp;P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares, and therefore our share repurchase program is currently suspended, other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share based compensation. Moving to guidance, we had a strong first half of the year and are adjusting and raising our guidance ranges. We’re raising revenue guidance to 4.635 billion to 4.675 billion with organic growth of 7% to 8%. Approximately 30 million of this increase is due to changes in FX rates, which are benefiting revenue, negative to margin percentage, but neutral to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is being raised to 2.02 billion to 2.03 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points adjusted for FX. Adjusted EPS is being increased to $3.15 per share to $3.17 per share. Finally, we expect cash conversion in the mid-60s as we lap our 2020 one-time cash impacts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance. Lance Uggla Thanks, Jonathan. We had another strong quarter as our end markets continue to recover and the teams have executed at a high level. We remain very confident in our ability to deliver strong results for the year as represented by our updated guidance. And operator, we're now ready to open the lines for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody.  Lance Uggla Hi, Kevin. Kevin McVeigh Hey, how are you? Hey, really, really great numbers in transportation and obviously, easier comp, but what's interesting to me is, we read a lot about constrained inventories, things like that. So, it seems like the numbers would have been that much stronger, if not for, even if there was more inventory out there. Any puts and takes you’d call out in particular, Lance or Jonathan, just because again, it’s really amazing numbers there? Lance Uggla Yeah, why don't I start and then we'll pass it over to Edouard, actually, because he's on with us. But I think the biggest thing is, and Edouard can build on this some more, if you took out 2020, what you really want to look at is recurring revenue growth 2019 to 2021, and that's a mid to upper teens number. So that's the blow away number. From my perspective, the team's done an amazing job that comes down with non-recurring revenue. And if you take the overall quarter 2019 to 2021, it's high single digits. And that's right in line if you look back to 2018, 2019, et cetera. So, my view is the teams recovered. They've done the maximum they can. They’ve innovated into new products. They’ve worked virtually well. I really think, it's been a stellar performance for them. But Edouard, do you want to add a little bit to that in terms of just your own color on the numbers? Edouard Tavernier Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Lance. Can you hear me now? Okay, cool. Thanks, Kevin, for the question. And just to build on what Lance said, good call out on the inventories. So, the industry is still in a process of recovery. And you're right. In this current environment, both dealers and carmakers have less of a need to spend on marketing. And that does create a headwind for some of our products. On the other hand, I would say that dealers, in particular, are currently seeing higher margins they’ve ever recorded. And when our customers do well, that's obviously a good thing for us.  So, you sort of have a balance here of headwinds and tailwinds. But the takeaway for me is that even in marked environments like today's auto industry, I think we're showing that our products are critical, must-have products that are helping dealers and carmakers sell more cars, and also, in the case of dealers, acquire used cars in a really tough, kind of used car market. So that's a big deal for us. And I'm really happy with how the business has been performing in response. Lance Uggla Thanks, Edouard. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Your line is open. Gary Bisbee Hey, good morning. I guess on Financial Services, continues to do quite well, a two-part question. How important is issuance in the last couple of quarters across equity and debt markets? And outside of the issuance benefit, what else would you call out that continues to do quite well here? Thank you. Lance Uggla Okay, maybe I can start and then I'll hand it over to Adam. I guess first off, yeah, I look at Financial Services in high single digits, and I just, to me that’s super strong quarter. So, great performance. I'd say the one thing I'd call out, which if you were following Markit, then IHS Markit over the years, we always viewed our solutions business is having double-digit growth opportunities. And for a little while that slipped into high-single-digits. It's been throughout 2019, 2020, and now 2021, we've started to see that recover and that's a 15% solution, sort of growth. Albeit some of its non-recurring, what's really important is that solutions growth brings and draws recurring revenue. So, a really super performance by the solutions team. I don’t know, Adam, do you want to add in terms of issuance, et cetera. Adam Kansler Yeah. I mean, one of the nice things about our business is the diversification of the asset classes in which we operate and the types of businesses that we have. So, a strong issuance market, it gives us a bit of a lift. But in other market environments where you see volatility, we have other platforms or other businesses that respond well in those environments. So, you do have a bit of a balance. Heavy issuance market, like we saw in Q1, in particular, that started to moderate a bit into Q2. It gives us some amount of lift, but across the portfolio, the core is really the strength in our pricing, our valuations, continued growth in demand for those products. And as Lance mentioned, our solutions, we made a significant investment over the last couple of years and we're winning some pretty significant mandates. And that's fueling growth. I think that will be an area of continued growth for us certainly over the mid-term. Lance Uggla Thanks, Adam. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open. Jeff Meuler Yeah, thank you. On the macro around connected cars that you call that in the prepared remarks, obviously, not new, but I guess what's the strategy for CARFAX or IHS auto to collect connected car data in real-time or near real-time? And I guess how important is that to you, kind of intermediate to long-term as you defend your position or look to find new sources of revenue? Lance Uggla Edouard, do you want to take that one? Edouard Tavernier  Yes, sure. Thank you, Jeff, and great question. So, over time, availability of connected car base is going to get bigger, coverage is going to get much better. And we see a couple of opportunities for us both in terms of access to data, to supplement what we do today, and also new business models. Today, we are running a number of POCs across our business, both on the CARFAX side of the business to figure out like what can we get from that base? And how can we supplement our existing resources, but also building that data set into workflow for carmakers such as dealer network optimization, dealer network designing.  So, an exciting opportunity for us. We see connected car data has been a critical source for us in the future. Right now, availability is limited. Coverage is very lighter and there are still some significant question marks around access to VIN-level data who owns that data, which will have to play out over the next two or three years. So, let's continue to watch this space together on the floors, but it will take two or three years for connected car data to emerge as something that we can really leverage. Lance Uggla Thanks, Edouard, Next question. Operator Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Andrew Steinerman Hi, Lance. I just wanted to hear a little bit more specifically about what will drive the recovery and IHS' Resources ACV for the balance of the year, surely I recognize Brent oil is back into the 70s. But just give us a sense of, kind of where and why IHS is seeing additional subscription revenue coming into ACV? Lance Uggla Okay. Probably Brian can give you a real good detail and more granular. So, I'll pass it over to you, Brian. Brian Crotty Yeah. So what we're seeing is, there’s really high demand right now for our clean tech, carbon, biofuels, crop science in our agri group, and plastics for chemicals. And we, what we've done this year is, we have new or expanded offerings in all those areas. So, we're just seeing that segment of the business really take off. Lance Uggla Okay. Thanks, Brian. Really, that’s that I mentioned that I think back [Technical Difficulty] at the merger 60/40, now, for the first time ever 50% downstream with agri having a 10% quarter. It really - the diversification is much, much better. And we'll continue to balance the set of assets with the energy transition and the team has done a good job. Thank you. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari My question is more related to the S&amp;P merger, could you maybe, Lance talk about any integration pre-planning that's gone on, maybe you could touch on employee morale, clearly, you know, the deal closes as you mentioned, Q4, but how is employee morale shaping up in terms of culturally and with that integration, you know, anything you can touch on, any color you can provide there from a pre-planning process, and also from an employee morale perspective? Thank you. Lance Uggla Right. Okay. Well, the year will be a year, December 1 to that final quarter. So, you know, it is a long time, but I have to say, you know, the team really got motivated together through COVID. So, you know, I just think the firm rallied around COVID. And culturally, you know, improved and delivered great results. And that carried us through most of the last year. Like anything, we worry that, you know, over time, you can get, you know, a merger fatigue. But we haven't noticed that at all.  I think S&amp;P has done a great job working with my teams on pre-merger planning. And because we've probably had an extra, you know, three or four months, they really have rolled up their sleeves, and just went deeper. And the other thing you should know is, you know, we don't have that much of employee morale issues, because, you know, our energy team is completely different, you know, how the plots of this overlap is going to create a sale that's been announced.  So, you know, even within Opus, people are excited about the fact that they'd be doing something new again. So, that's not an issue. There's no overlap with our upstream and downstream businesses in the Platts, really. The financial services, Adam’s going to be leading that. And, you know, it's exciting integration given lots of opportunities. Automotive, transportation, no real need for overlaps, so Edouard is leading that. Sally's leaving alliances and building a new team across S&amp;P.  So, I think, you know, the teams are all highly motivated. Where the overlap is, of course, in the services, and, you know we did a really good job, both firms have treated the employees very well through this merger period. And so, we haven't had a lot of people at all leaving the firm. And, you know, I feel my teams have done an exceptional job, and are still highly motivated. Jonathan's been leading the IMO from our side. So, maybe he can add a little bit of additional color to that. Jonathan Gear Sure, Lance. Will do. I mean, just as you let your question, [certainly there’s] been some very intensive integration planning going on, completely going back to severance, but first we announced this. And teams have been stood up across all the different functions, all the different areas, of course, being careful not to jump the gun, but really get ahead on the integration planning. And then that process, I think a couple things have come out. First, I think, as we identified synergies at – when we announced the deal. We've taken the last few quarters to really begin to solidify exactly the path to [indiscernible] synergies and I think we’re increasing confidence on how to get there.  And the second thing culturally, to your question, it's been a great opportunity for the teams to really work with one another and get to know each other and get to know their future colleagues extremely well. And I think what's come out of that is certainly Lance and I knew from our discussions in the fall is the values of the two firms are very, very similar. And I think as the two teams have gotten to know each other, it's been relieving, if you will, for them to get to know that their colleagues are going to be working with other people that they want to work with. So, we’re making great progress both culturally, as well as the integration planning, and we [indiscernible] well set up when we close. Lance Uggla Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst Hi, this is Adam on for Shlomo. What level of costs were reintroduced into the business through the re-openings? And how might this have impacted margins in the quarter?  Lance Uggla Jonathan, do you want to do that one? Jonathan Gear  Sure. So, there was a couple different areas where we did. So, if you call last year, Q, what Q2 call last year, when we were entering COVID, we took some significant cost reductions, some of those were permanent, and those permanent cost savings have indeed been permanent. They haven't crept back in, but some were certainly temporary. There was impacts on executive salaries, few other things we did, we pulled back on marketing spend, for example on CARFAX given that the dealers had shut down in North America. And so those costs and we certainly built it into our plan, into our guidance this year, those costs have been reversed.  So, it does create a – I will call it somewhat odd dynamic or the absolute margin of the segment level with transportation, for example, when we take significant costs, reductions in Q2 of last year, you see a significant year-on-year margin accretion, which is a little bit of a false economy, I would say. You should see that normalize going forward. But those have been the main costs and have come back in. Then of course, we continue to invest in the business and where we see strong performance, they should make investments to fund future growth. But the key thing I will call out is really you're seeing the year-on-year reverse of some of those temporary cost reductions from last year. Lance Uggla Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. George Tong Hi, thanks. Good morning. You increased your full-year guidance for organic revenue growth given strength in transportation. How do you expect your updated guide to flow through to your fiscal 2022 outlook given current trends in each of your segments? Lance Uggla Yeah, I think I'll let Jonathan add after me, but, you know, the key thing that I think people should look at is, it's a very, you know, we're halfway – over halfway through our fiscal year. We've given you a very narrow; you know 40 million of revenue guidance, and an even narrower EBITDA guidance. And, you know, if you look at our track record, you know, over the last many years, we don't miss our guidance. So, the fact is, is we've given you a very accurate picture, for this year, float all the way through into earnings.  Of course, we also feel that, you know, our strong, you know mid-to-upper single-digit revenue profile as a firm is one that's very intact. And we expect that to continue. And so I don't see us changing the percentage of revenue growth expected into 2020, 2023, 2024, but that's not to say that as we go into those years, if we have strong, you know, first second quarter, we don't have any issue with, you know, raising our view forward, and we'd love to beat our guidance, but I don't see us changing, you know, across the mix of our businesses. So, you know mid-to-high single digit revenue growth in 2022 off of our closing 2021 numbers. Jonathan, do you want to add anything else to that? Jonathan Gear  No, but maybe there's a couple of comments add to yours, Lance. I mean, first of all, we did give our 2021 guidance this time last year, coming out of all the noise of COVID. I’m actually really proud of the team that even with all the uncertainties back then, we are landing the plane, kind of as we expected. And as Lance has alluded to, great, great performance by the team.  Now, I will say, George, in terms of a raise in the guidance this time, obviously, we're doing on the back of what we saw in the first half of the year and what we're seeing go forward. I think at this point, we're not prepared to really give formal guidance for 2022. I think we'll be back to our normal cadence. Obviously, much rather be in position of strength exiting the year than position of weakness. But as Lance was saying, I think at this point, no news in terms of changes to future growth will surely get back to you later in the year once we finalize our plans. Lance Uggla Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan Thank you. I wanted to ask about ESG, when you think about the $70 million of ESG revenue, it spans across a number of different areas, emissions, data, supply chain, solar wind, hydrogen, etcetera. I guess who's competing against you in these areas? And are there any capabilities or datasets that you don't have right now that you would like to? Thank you. Lance Uggla Yeah, that's a good question Toni. Thanks for that. So, we – I think where IHS Markit standalone has an edge in ESG is clearly around the E, and scope 123 emissions science-based targets, the challenges of, you know, for corporations, governments who will want to regulate coming out of the [COP 26], these are areas where we have real substantive detail, climate analytics. We have data that plays into climate analytics. So, location data around energy assets, our maritime and trade group have very detailed supply chain footprints for all the maritime fleet.  We have, you know, some great new products and services that play into research and development around E. So, I think we have the competitive edge as IHS Markit in E. When you marry that with S&amp;P Global, I actually think the combination gets even stronger, and they do have the RobecoSAM, Trucost, and other assets that are very, very valuable in terms of, you know, competing with the likes of, you know MSCI, FTSE, the LSE group, you know various providers of ESG ratings and scores that are much more driven off the, you know, public knowledge, SNG versus the E.  So I think our combination is going to give us a competitive edge and give us a lot of opportunity to grow into, and I think across S&amp;P Global and IHS Markit, this is a very strong double-digit growth engine for, you know, at least a decade. Because, you know, there's 1.5 trillion a year being spent, you know, on climate change now, and that number is expected to grow to something like 4.5 trillion. And so, I think we've got lots to offer, and you know we'll watch this space closely. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Silber Thank you so much. This is actually a follow-up from Hamzah’s question on your internal workforce. You said you have not had a lot of people leave since the merger announcement. That's great. I'm assuming you've been hiring since, if you could just confirm the size of your workforce has increased since the merger announcement? And if so, how difficult is it to find these people, and are you having to pay higher than normal wages? Thanks. Lance Uggla [Indiscernible] let the team add to this one. So, I'll go to Jonathan or if he wants to pass it to any of the division heads he can. We're definitely hiring, and we're definitely, you know, with the growth numbers, you know, we're growing. And in many cases, we're growing into new spaces, in the markets to operate in. So, I haven't seen this have any, you know, challenges to hire. You know, and of course, in a merger, we make sure that we retain our people and look after them.  So, I don't notice anything that stands out, you know, from my perspective, but if any of the division heads want to add anything in terms of hiring, etcetera, maybe you can start Jonathan if you know our overall employment growth across the group, year-over-year, and then if any of the division heads want to add? Jonathan Gear Sure, maybe I’ll just give a general overview and then the division heads can supplement as they like. So, first off to your point is first, the attrition we've seen kind of year to date has been very much in line with what we normally see. And so no [indiscernible], we are growing. And you're absolutely right. We are growing and investing in all the different businesses that that Adam, Edouard and Brian, lead, in particular growing in India has always been a growth sector for us. India is a hot market. Itself is – what we're very, very attractive employers always, you know, challenged to find great people.  I would say that the challenge we have finding people this year really is not that different from other years. It's always, you look attractive, the best people and pull them in, is never easy, but we always try and to get it done. So, we are growing. Certain markets are hotter than other markets, certain segments, particularly in technology, data science, etcetera, the usual places you would expect. Obviously difficult, but I wouldn't say dramatically different this year from prior years. But happy to open up to the divisional leads to add some more color. Edouard Tavernier I'll just add something to what Jonathan said. I would say it’s in pockets, right. I think is a great question. Technology is one of those pockets. You may have seen in some places an uptick in nutrition, and we have struggles to hire great tech talent in some locations. So, our strategy here is to diversify the sources of talent. But as you know, we are actively engaged in globalizing our talent footprint and that’s helping us and in some cases, adjusted wages [indiscernible] by and large that we're funding the [chance we need]. Lance Uggla  Adam, do you want to add anything or Brian? Adam Kansler Yeah, no, the only comment maybe I'd make Lance is, we, obviously were operating a competitive job market. We put a lot of attention into our internship and our early careers programs where we brought large groups of young people into the firm and that pipeline, you know, that's like that gives us great strength forward. That's a real investment in the future of the firm. And I think that's a place where we've seen real progress both in our diversity and equality, as well as just bringing great talent that continues to join and progress within our firm. Lance Uggla Okay. Brian, anything? Brian Crotty No. I mean, I think I agree. I'm seeing the same things that Edouard and Adam are and definitely our internship programs really help onboard good talent as those are grad. So, I think we're firing on all cylinders there. Lance Uggla Yeah. No, it's great. We have over 250 interns and 250 graduates joining. So, you know, that fuels, a lot of our growth that manages our expenses. Okay, next question. Operator Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open. Andrew Nicholas Great. Thanks for taking my question. I know it's a smaller piece of business, but I was wondering if you could speak a bit to the performance of CMS in the quarter. And what the medium-term outlook looks like for that segment? I think recurring revenue held up decently well throughout the past, kind of year plus, and I know, you get some non-recurring revenue from the boiler pressure, vessel codes in the back half of this year, but excluding that, do you think CMS can get into the mid-single-digits range, longer-term? And if so, what are the primary drivers to getting there? Thank you. Lance Uggla Yeah, I'll start that. Jonathan can add if needs to. But, you know, we've really retooled CMS toward mid-single-digit growth. We called it out in this quarter that we expect the full-year to be mid-single-digits. So, you know, again I think you guys have, you know, strong confidence in the numbers we give you. And we expect to hit them. So, but you know, long term organic growth means you do it over and over and over again.  And then people give you that valuation expectation, and CMS has been, you know, in need of retooling and building out, our tech platform, the team has done a great job. They are seeing demand, and that's flowing through to, you know, better recurring revenue. So, I think the team's done a great job. I think moving from low up to mid-single-digits is step one. And we expect that the team will be able to do that through this year and then again into next year. Jonathan? Jonathan Gear Great last year – maybe just a few things I would add, because if you look at CMS, there are really two divisions or two major divisions. One is product design. One is our economic and country risk. So, then, product design, it has been a multi-year investment back in technology and new platforms and products. We begin to see that lift take place that drives. As Lance said, not a single year, but kind of a multi-year sustainable organic growth. We do certainly see as we look the first half of the year and then look at what's building in the second half of the year.  We do see a path for that to get to mid-single-digit seconds for the full-year, based on what we're seeing. That we think should be a sustainable growth rate. On the economic company risk that that Adam mentioned, this has been some significant investments in terms of new products and new packaging around how we get much more of a persona-based approach with our products there. And similar story where those investments were made to, kind of – end of last year early this year, and received the benefit in our growth through our pipeline, we expect to see that lift second half of the year. So, out report divisions, our lowest growth rate first half of the year, we would expect it to get to mid-singles by the end of the year. Lance Uggla Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Andrew Jeffrey Hi, thank you. Good morning, everybody. Appreciate taking the question. Just wondering a little bit, Lance, you know, the transportation business has been fantastic and it sounds broad based, some of what you described in terms of the market dynamics feels a little bit like peak cycle. I just wonder if you could address that next year, obviously, comparison side, assuming supply chains loosen up a little bit. Used car prices perhaps normalize, anything we need to think about, you know, in terms of 2021 as being sort of an exceptional year that sets up just a tougher, you know, sort of macro backdrop for transportation next year? Lance Uggla Right. Well, I guess it's the merger of IHS and Markit, you know that, I got used to that question every single quarter. So, about 20 quarters of that same question. So it's a good – it obviously is a good question because it's the one that's on the mind of all of our analysts. And I think what you should be really looking at is high single digit growth for transportation. And it does that time and time again, in a very diversified way. And sometimes it's used car markets, sometimes it's new car markets. Sometimes it's marketing and advertising.  Sometimes it's, you know, supply chain in predictive analytics. And so when everything's ticking, we can peek into double digits, but in general, I look at transportation, say it's a strong high single digit performer with ample opportunity in its markets to maintain that. And it's not reliant on new or used car sales alone, but many things that are actually needed by the automotive suppliers, and the OEMs, regardless of the environment we're in.  So, they all need to market from cars, they all need to spend their incentives, they all need to measure their emissions, they all need to order parts and study the supply chains. They all need to do R&amp;D, and look into the future car, the connected car, the electrification of vehicles, next will be hydrogen. So, there's always stuff to be done. Then we get on the dealer floor. And the marriage of CARFAX and Mastermind and helping dealers sell cars in a connected digital world, those types of tools become even more important.  And so, I think, you know, you can expect more of the same in the high-single-digit range for transportation. But, you know, this is an outsize quarter that’s catching up from, you know, a COVID period where, you know, really the comparison. You know, it's exciting to get to save 39% we actually teased the team that it wasn't 40, because would have been nicer number to shout out. But the fact is, it's really a high single digit consistent growth scenario, where the team's recovered really well. I'm all in there. I think that was our final question operator? Operator We do have a question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Your line is open. Lance Uggla Okay. Go ahead, Doug. Doug Arthur Yes, thanks. I'll make it quick. Lance, last just on the ACV turning up, would you, I mean you’ve given various updates on your, kind of pendulum swinging there on ACV, is it sort of as expected at this point or is it a little ahead of schedule? Lance Uggla No, I'd say as expected. We're definitely not ahead of schedule, but, you know, what I really like is the continued shift to a division that's highly diversified, like financial services, like transportation where we've got strong diversification across, you know, many facets of global economies that are, you know dealing with energy transition, new sources of energy, circular economy and demands waste. This division is with its expertise and chemicals to agricultural business. The continued need for, you know, 90 million, 100 million barrels a day of oil, oil prices at 70, when it wasn't long ago, they were sub-50.  So, you know, this team is always in thought leadership in center stage. And, yeah, we've had, it's been one of the toughest divisions as we've come out of, I had to go through COVID. But, you know, we're back to, you know, an expected, probably low-to-mid single-digit growth year in 2022 for energy. And, you know, if 2022 could be the first year where, you know, you've got CMS, you've got energy in the mid-single-digits, and you've got transportation and financial services in high-single-digits. You know, that's kind of, that's the home run and we're going to deliver this firm very strong into the S&amp;P Global strategic merger. I think that might be the final question, but let me know operator. Operator Our final question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik Thank you. Hi Lance. Sorry. I just wanted to unpack maybe, I'll keep it quick, that low-to-mid single-digit growth, you talked about resources. Can you just help break it down? You know, clearly, everyone's talking about energy transition going well, but that's probably, you know, a smaller part of the business. And I just wanted to understand how you guys see the dynamics between, you know, obviously, oil prices going up, but the energy companies still pressured and the zero-carbon world or whatever. So, you know, how do you see those moving pieces there? Yeah. Lance Uggla I think the easiest thing to do is, you take 50% of that division, and you call it high-single-digits. You know, agriculture had a 10. You know, chemicals has been consistently, mid-to-high single-digits, Opus has been consistent mid-to-high single-digits, even occasional quarter in double digits. And then you go to upstream and if you really want to be tough on upstream, you know, you could say it's flat, and that's your, you know, your low-single-digits, upstream recovering though, off of the price concessions, etcetera to be low-to-mid single-digits puts the whole division at, you know, 5% to 7%. And so, you know, I don't think it's a tall order to see those types of revenue gross in 2022.  And, you know, we're well set up for that. And the demand around, you know, just understanding energy related assets in a world of – driven by regulatory change, climate change, investor perceptions, and demands, I actually think, our team's roles to help energy market participants navigate these forward challenges. I think there's a lot of growth. We saw, you know, CERAWeek virtually, you know, I was shocked at the turnout and the, you know the needs of the teams to engage market participants in thought leadership. We saw the same in the world petrochemical conference, and our Maritime &amp; Trade, which is more around supply chain and the trade analytics.  So, I really – yeah, I guess I just, you know I'm not a crazy optimist, but I think that, you know, when we say mid, you know, single-digits we mean, and I think that Brian and the team, you know, have navigated COVID very well. But it was tough. It was the toughest division to run from a strategic point of view through this challenging period. It just had the most moving parts and the team, you know, I have to say, you know, they don't have the highest results. But, you know, for me, I give them a badge of honor. So, great job. We'll end there. I think operator, I'll try it one more time, unless somebody came in for another question. I think we're finished. Operator There are no further questions. Lance Uggla I'll turn it back to Eric. Eric Boyer Great. We thank you for your interest in IHS Markit.

We will open the conference to questions and answers after the presentation and instructions will follow at that time. To access the webcast and slides, go to investor.spglobal.com. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&amp;P Global. Sir, you may begin. Chip Merritt Thank you for joining S&amp;P Global's first quarter 2021 earnings call. Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a news release with our results earlier today. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com. Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, as we announced late last year, S&amp;P Global and IHS Markit entered into a definitive merger agreement. In March, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger. The merger is pending regulatory approval, and we expect to close in the second half of 2021. This call will touch on the merger, but does not constitute an offer to sell or buy or the solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which this offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities law of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933. In connection with the proposed transaction, S&amp;P Global and IHS Markit has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which includes a joint proxy statement and a prospectus. S&amp;P Global and IHS Markit have filed other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC. Investors and security holders of S&amp;P Global or IHS Markit stock are urged to carefully read the entire registration statement and joint proxy statement prospectus, which is available on our website and sec.gov. In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we provide adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This call, especially the discussion of our outlook, contains statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in our filings with the SEC and on our website. I would also like to call your attention to European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&amp;P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be delivered to Dave Guarino at 201-755-5334. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug? Doug Peterson Thank you, Chip. Welcome to today's earnings call. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the essential nature of our products has demonstrated the resilience of our business model. As the economy improves, our colleagues continue to launch innovative new products to help our customers with the ratings, benchmarks, data and insights they need to navigate the recovery. We continue to prioritize the safety of our colleagues, and I want to thank them again for their dedication and commitment in these extremely unusual and challenging times. Now let me begin with our first quarter financial highlights. S&amp;P Global is off to a great start in 2021, as we delivered exceptional first quarter results. Revenue increased 13%, and all four businesses delivered revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin improvement. Ratings once again delivered the strongest revenue growth from a surge in leveraged loans, high-yield issuance and structured finance. Adjusted expense growth was limited to less than 2%, thanks to our ongoing productivity program and lower T&amp;E. It's very rare when we increase guidance on our first quarter earnings call. However, we expect additional growth in Ratings from strong issuance of high-yield and structured finance and in Indices from the higher level of AUM and equities. Therefore, we're raising our annual guidance for 2021. Ewout will provide details in a moment. I would also like to share some additional highlights from the first quarter. We issued a report, highlighting the performance of our ratings in 2020, which demonstrated that our ratings showed their value as indicators of creditworthiness and relative default risk. Our investment in growth initiatives continues to result in new product launches particularly in ESG, Platts benchmarks, Kensho and our Marketplace. Our China Ratings business is gaining momentum, and we just entered into the first sustainability-linked banking facility in the US information services space. We'll provide further details on all these accomplishments on today's call. The most important initiative of the year will be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit. This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our company and our customers. The combination of S&amp;P Global and IHS Markit creates a very strong company. We will have increased scale and world-class products across numerous core markets with a track record of deploying cutting-edge technology to accelerate our powering the markets of the future strategy. Together, we can offer our customers differentiated data, analytics, research and benchmarks, important to the workflows of many of the world's leading companies. I'm incredibly proud of the team we've built at S&amp;P Global, and I look forward to welcoming the talented IHS Markit employees to our company. There are three parallel paths that are underway to close the transaction and prepare for the combination. Our progress is on track, and we continue to expect closing in the second half of 2021. The first was shareholder approval. The recent shareholder votes at both companies was overwhelmingly passed with 99% of the votes in favor of the merger. The second is regulatory approval. We're working toward regulatory approval in the countries listed. The third is pre-close integration planning. The integration teams continue to prepare for day one readiness. These teams are developing plans that focus on organization integration, real estate consolidation, technology, scale and efficiency, cross-selling and new product development. And the value capture work stream is preparing to pursue and track synergies. We've been doing a lot of work to make sure that when our companies are united, we have the culture, purpose and values in place to position us for success. To recap the financial results for the first quarter, revenue increased 13% to $2 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 23%, and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 450 basis points to 57.6%. As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on a trailing four quarter basis, which increased 300 basis points to 54.5%. In addition, diluted shares outstanding decreased [Technical Difficulty] in adjusted diluted EPS. Each quarter, we highlight a few key drivers to our business and important projects underway. This quarter, let me start with Ratings bond issuance trends. During the first quarter, global bond issuance increased 9%. Turning to the data. In the US, bond issuance in aggregate increased 4% as investment-grade decreased 17%, high-yield increased 111%, public finance increased 9% and structured finance increased 17%, mostly due to a 63% increase in CLOs. European bond issuance increased 23% as investment-grade increased 22%, high-yield increased 53% and structured finance increased 6%, mostly due to more than a tripling of CLO volume. In Asia, bond issuance increased 11% overall. The data on this slide only [Technical Difficulty] overall global issuance increased 13%. Since bank loan ratings are an important element of Ratings revenue and they're not included in our bond issuance slide, we like to disclose this bank loan rating revenue each quarter. In the first quarter, bank loan rating revenue surged 70% to $148 million. In fact, first quarter revenue from leveraged loans is more than half the leveraged loan revenue in all of 2020. The next two slides look at the combined high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume for the US and Europe. Data is not readily available for the rest of the world. This slide shows that over the last three years, the combination of global leveraged loan and high-yield issuance has averaged $244 billion per quarter. The first quarter of 2021 reached a quarterly record of $465 billion, nearly twice the quarterly average for the past three years. This slide depicts the combination of high-yield issuance [Technical Difficulty]. The category with the largest increase was refinancing, some of which could include pull forward. M&amp;A and LBO activity and buybacks and dividends also increased. The CLO market had the busiest quarter on record in both the US and Europe, with twice the volume of new issuances in the first quarter of last year. We believe that investor demand for floating-rate instruments, their search for yield and the relatively strong CLO performance during 2020 pandemic had contributed to increased CLO issuance this year. Whilst exciting to see increases in issuance, what's always more important to us is how our ratings perform. 2020 was a tumultuous year, yet our ratings performed as designed. In February, S&amp;P Global Ratings issued a report entitled Credit Trends: Review of Ratings Performance Highlights Resilience in 2020. We pulled this chart from the report. You can see that the level of [Technical Difficulty] with lower-rated issuers having higher levels of default. You will notice that the graph only includes high-yield issuers. This is because, in 2020, not one single issuer that was rated investment-grade by S&amp;P Ratings at the beginning of 2020 defaulted. Importantly, amid challenging economic circumstances our ratings in 2020 showed their value as indicators of creditworthiness and relative default risk. Turning to our investments in growth initiatives. Let me start with ESG. We continue to make advances with our ESG franchise across the board. After recording ESG revenue of $65 million in 2020, we're off to a good start in the first quarter with revenue up more than 40% to $21 million. In Ratings, in the first quarter, we completed 18 ESG evaluations, six Green Evaluations and 53 SAM benchmark engagements. This compares to 40 ESG evaluations, [Technical Difficulty] SAM benchmark engagements completed in all of 2020. We also launched new social and sustainability Framework Alignment Opinions. In Market Intelligence, our ESG scores have been enhanced. 400 data points have been made available for each company that we score. The additional data points will provide clients with a better understanding of companies' environmental reporting disclosures, biodiversity commitments, CO2 and greenhouse emissions, waste and hazardous disposal, energy consumption and water usage. For the social dimension, it will now be possible to determine whether companies disclose safety policies, human rights commitments, code of ethics and whether social reporting disclosures have been independently audited. The new data sets will also provide greater insights on the governance and economic dimensions and help obtain better understanding of companies' codes of conduct and policies addressing anticrime, corruption and bribery, governance of the Board and executive compensation, [Technical Difficulty] disclosures, risk and supply chain management and tax strategy and reporting. Market Intelligence also launched an ESG data solution to support the European Commission's sustainable finance disclosure requirements, enabling market participants to meet these disclosure requirements. In Indices, we had $22.9 billion of ESG, ETF, AUM at the end of the first quarter. This is an increase of more than 400% since the end of the first quarter of last year. Our Indices business also launched ESG versions of our S&amp;P MidCap 400 and S&amp;P SmallCap 600 indices. In addition, UBS licensed the S&amp;P 500 ESG Elite Index for a new ETF, and Barclays licensed the S&amp;P EuroUSA 50, Low Carbon ESG Select Equal Weight Index for use in structured products. Platts has been very active [Technical Difficulty]. You may be wondering why we include a copper assessment as an ESG product. It's because this new assessment will help support the need for increased solar, wind, energy storage systems, electric vehicle and EV charging stations, all of which require large amounts of copper. For example, an electric vehicle uses approximately 175 pounds of copper. Platts also launched hydro-treated vegetable oil price assessments. HVO, also known as renewable diesel in America, is a biomass-derived fuel suitable for diesel engines. It is made of non-petroleum renewable resources such as natural fat, vegetable oil and greases and can be blended in traditional diesel or used as a substitute. And finally, Platts launched daily assessments for low-carbon aluminum and zero carbon aluminum, which will complement existing Platts European price offerings for high-grade primary aluminum. [Technical Difficulty] quantify cost and manage risk for the opportunities associated with a growing focus on carbon reduction strategies amid increasing global regulation. On Earth Day last week, S&amp;P Global launched a new ESG brand, Sustainable1, your single source of essential sustainability intelligence. With the wide array of ESG capabilities that we have and the fact that many of our customers are interested in multiple products from different divisions, we have unified our ESG efforts across the company. This includes product development, technology, channel partnerships, distribution, marketing, sales and client support. We believe that this new brand will help convey S&amp;P Global's commitment and leadership position in ESG. Outside of ESG, let me highlight a few other new product launches and product enhancements. We launched Kensho NERD, short for Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation. NERD was developed by the company's natural language processing team, which specializes in machine learning research and engineering related to analyzing and understanding human language. This is the first entity extraction system specifically optimized for business-related documents. NERD makes it easier for users to analyze unstructured text, for example, investigating suppliers and competitors mentioned in company filings, and enables them to drill down instantaneously to the documents they need to see. We launched the S&amp;P MAESTRO 5 Index, which is designed to measure the performance of a multi-asset risk parity strategy with a 5% target volatility. The index allocates risk equally among seven equity, fixed income and commodity indices and further mitigates equity market volatility by dynamically allocating to S&amp;P VIX future indices. With about 100 different data sets available on the Marketplace we launched last year, we created Product Finder, to help clients find what they're looking for based on their job function, topic, use case and workflow. For example, someone working in investment banking and deal origination can receive different results from a search than a corporate client in a supply chain role. Platts expanded its presence in shipping with the new APSI five dry bulk weighted index for Supramax class bulkers. APSI five is the dry bulk freight market's first regional weighted average index, capturing the Asia Pacific trade on Supramax bulkers. This product continues to fill out our shipping products. One of the most important aspects of managing benchmarks is to ensure that they are periodically updated to reflect underlying market conditions. When streams of oil that feed a benchmark become depleted, they need to be replaced. After consulting with market participants, Platts is progressing work to add West Texas Intermediate Midland as an additional stream to Dated Brent. Since the 1980s, Dated Brent has acted as the benchmark for and is currently used to price approximately 60% of global waterborne crude. This change will provide significant additional volume and ensure the continued robustness of the Brent complex. Let me now turn to our outlook for global issuance and GDP. After issuance growth of 15% in 2019 and 17% in 2020, our ratings research group initial 2021 forecast called for a decrease of 3%. The updated forecast issued earlier this week now calls for a decrease of 2%, excluding international public finance. There were two changes. Structured finance went from a 3% gain to a 6% gain and non-financials went from a 9% decrease to a 7.5% decrease. Please note that this is a bond issuance forecast. This is not a revenue forecast. For example, it doesn't address non-transaction revenue and doesn't include leveraged loan activity. There are clearly puts and takes when we think about 2021 issuance. For example, the bulk of the first quarter's corporate issuance came from repeat issuers who may have exhausted their funding needs early this year on the anticipation of rising rates. However, there are several items that should support upcoming issuance, including a rebound in economic growth, very favorable financing conditions, large amounts of sovereign debt with negative yields and a growing pipeline of pending M&amp;A deals. We have revised our 2021 global GDP growth forecast, up by 50 basis points to 5.5%. The economic recovery looks set to accelerate in mid-2021, particularly in the US on back of a massive fiscal stimulus plan, although a high degree of unevenness and uncertainty persists. An issue is the pace of vaccinations and the spread of virus variants. The US and UK have taken the lead in vaccinations. A slow rollout is hampering the rebound in Europe, and we expect slow vaccination rollouts to cause the recovery in several key emerging markets to lag. Our economists view orderly reflation as a positive development for both the economy and credit. We also believe that rising yields on the back of a robust recovery is a positive as opposed to rising yields solely on inflation concern. Moving away from very low rates lessens the search for yield and lessens distortions to financial and non-financial asset prices. And finally, Platts is forecasting that oil will remain above $60 a barrel through 2022. This bodes well for the health of the oil industry. I will now turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who's going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout? Ewout Steenbergen Thank you, Doug. Let me start with our first quarter financial results. Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. While there were some acquisitions and divestitures since the first quarter of 2020, the revenue associated with them was not large enough to result in a difference between reported and organic revenue growth. Adjusted total expenses only increased 2%, thanks to ongoing productivity programs and lower T&amp;E. Keep in mind that while T&amp;E remains almost nonexistent, the year-over-year benefits will no longer exists, beginning in the second quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and an increase in taxes on foreign operations. While the effective tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of discrete tax adjustments, our full year tax rate guidance remains unchanged. Our diluted shares outstanding declined by 1.7 million shares. This was the result of shares repurchased before we paused the share repurchase programs, due to the pending merger. During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.03. The only meaningful impact was in Ratings, where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $9 million. We are introducing three new categories to provide insight into the type of expenses that are going to be incurred related to the pending merger. The first category is transaction costs. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees. The second category is integration costs. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure and retention costs. The third category is cost to achieve. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees and costs related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements. In the first quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments collectively totaled to a net pre-tax loss of $81 million. They included $9 million for merger transaction costs; $40 million for merger integration costs. There were no merger costs to achieve this quarter. These will begin to occur around the closing of the merger. A $2 million gain for an adjustment on the prior year period divestiture, $2 million for Kensho retention-related expenses and $31 million in deal-related amortization. This quarter, all four divisions delivered increased revenue and adjusted operating profit. On a trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased significantly in Ratings, Platts and Market Intelligence, while Indices had a small decrease. I will provide color on the individual business results in a moment. Now, turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet has low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $4.5 billion, debt of $4.1 billion, an undrawn revolver capacity of $1.5 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8 times. We recently entered into the first sustainability-linked banking facility in the US information services sector. Linking our line of credit to our emission reduction targets verified by the Science Based Targets Initiative is another tangible example of our commitment to becoming net zero by 2040. Free cash flow excluding certain items was $718 million in the first quarter, an increase of $100 million or 16% over the prior year period. Due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, share repurchases have been curtailed. If there is an open window and we have an opportunity, we will repurchase shares before the merger closes. If not, we anticipate resuming share repurchases after the merger is completed. Now let's turn to the division results. Ratings revenue increased 23%. This revenue growth was driven by the increase in issuance Doug already discussed. Adjusted expenses increased 9%. Excluding changes in foreign exchange rates and the acquisition of Greenwich Associates by CRISIL, adjusted expenses increased 5% primarily due to increased salary and incentives, partially offset by lower T&amp;E. These resulted in a 32% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 440 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 340 basis points to 63.6%. Please keep in mind that, the 67.5% adjusted segment operating profit margin achieved in the first quarter is temporarily elevated based on the surge of issuance in high-yield, levered loans and structured finance. In China, we see momentum and interest in our ratings picking up. In fact, we completed 18 ratings in the first quarter compared to 22 in all last year. Non-transaction revenue increased 10% primarily due to growth at CRISIL, fees associated with surveillance as well as elevated new entity ratings and Ratings Evaluation Services activity. Notably, revenue from Ratings Evaluation Services and new entity ratings each increased approximately 30%. In fact, there were 217 new entity ratings this quarter, the highest quarterly total in over two years. This was due to investors quest for yield and increased risk appetite, enabling increasingly weaker credits to raise debt. Transaction revenue increased 35% primarily due to substantial levels of high-yield issuance, bank loan ratings and structured finance. This slide depicts Ratings revenue by the end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was a 27% increase in corporates. In addition, financial services revenue increased 10%, structured finance increased 34%, governments increased 18% and the CRISIL and other category increased 8%. On the right side of the slide, you can see the changes in revenue within structured finance. The clear driver of growth was a 70% increase in CLO revenue. Turning to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the segment delivered 4% revenue growth primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices and data subscriptions, substantially offset by reduced exchange-traded derivative activity. In the first quarter, adjusted expenses only increased 2%. This was particularly low as the first quarter of 2020 had elevated expenses, including a $4 million catch-up charge on past royalties. The adjusted segment operating profit increased 5%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 71.3%. On a trailing four-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 69.3%.  Revenue growth was mixed this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 15% with gains in ETFs, mutual funds and insurance and over-the-counter derivative activity. Exchange-traded derivative revenue decreased 24% on reduced trading volumes. The first quarter of last year saw extraordinary volatility related to the pandemic market correction, creating a very difficult comparison. Data and custom subscriptions only increased 1% due to a catch-up in real-time customer reporting in the first quarter last year.  For our Indices division, over the past year, ETF net inflows were $125 billion and market appreciation totaled $749 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.2 trillion, which is 65% higher compared to one year ago, when the market was near its pandemic low. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 30% year-over-year. Sequentially, versus the end of 2020, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $73 billion and market appreciation totaled $143 billion.  As I just noted, exchange-rated derivative revenue faced a difficult comparison. Activity at the CBOE decreased in the first quarter with S&amp;P 500 Index options activity decreasing 29% and VIX futures and options activity decreasing 23%. Activity at the CME equity complex decreased 6%. Market Intelligence delivered reported and organic revenue growth of 4%. Collectively, revenue from recently launched products increased by over 40%. This was primarily from ESG, Panjiva, aftermarket research, Marketplace and SME data.  Adjusted expenses were flat as recent productivity initiatives and lower T&amp;E offset salary growth and higher investment spending. Investment spending continues, particularly with the Marketplace and SME initiatives. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 13%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 260 basis points to 33.5%. On a trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 120 basis points to 33.1%.  Looking across the Market Intelligence components, Desktop revenue grew 2%. Data Management Solutions revenue grew 9% and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 6%. Based on our ACV trends, we expect Desktop to grow low to mid-single digits for the full year and both Data Management Solutions and Credit Risk Solutions to grow high single-digit this year.  And now turning to Platts. Reported revenue increased 5%. Our core subscriptions increased 6%. Over the past year, oil prices have increased, resulting in a customer base that is healthier, and our retention rates remained in the mid-90s.  Global Trading Services decreased 4% compared to a very strong first quarter of 2020. GTS revenue decreased, mainly due to lower petroleum and natural gas volumes partially offset by increased LNG volume. Adjusted expenses improved 7% due to lower T&amp;E, rent and bad debt provision.  Please note that we expect expenses to pick up in the second quarter as Platts investment spending increases. Adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 520 basis points to 58.1%. The trailing four-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 280 basis points to 56%.  On our first quarter earnings call last year, Doug noted that the first-ever Kensho-powered price assessments went live. One year later, we now have 19 markets that have Kensho-powered price assessments. This has resulted in more than a 75% reduction in publishing time. This quarter, because shipping has increasingly become an important product offering for Platts customers, we're introducing shipping as a new category. Shipping is essential to commodities trading with 90% of global trade transported by sea.  S&amp;P Global Platts has been in the business of providing transparency to the shipping market for more than 35 years. These assessments are used by market participants for physical benchmarking, and five are listed by exchanges as the basis of derivative contracts.  In 2014, Platts expanded its freight offering into the dry freight market with daily assessment of freight rates for key commodity trade routes for products such as iron ore, coal, grains, sugar, bauxite and alumina. Platts now publishes hundreds of daily freight rate assessments covering all major shipping markets. To help you with your models, we have provided historical quarterly information on the new reporting basis in the appendix of this slide deck.  And finally, while every category on this slide grew revenue during the quarter, the fastest growth was in petrochemicals. We're not providing 2021 GAAP guidance because, given the inherent uncertainty around the merger, management cannot reliably predict all the necessary components of GAAP measures.  This slide depicts our adjusted guidance. While we expect that the merger will occur in the second half of this year, we're providing adjusted guidance on a standalone basis. The second column shows our new 2021 adjusted guidance with all the line items that James highlighted. We're making these changes because we now have expectations for greater revenue growth primarily due to improved outlooks in Ratings and Indices. While we expect greater revenue growth, it's not enough to change our revenue guidance. Therefore, our revenue guidance remains a mid single-digit increase. Operating profit margin is increased by 20 basis points to a range of 54% to 54.5%. And this results in a $0.30 increase in adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $12.55 to $12.75. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased by $100 million to a range of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. In conclusion, we're off to a great start to 2021 with exceptional first quarter results. Vaccinations are rolling out. The global economy is poised for accelerated growth, and our customers are benefiting from these improvements. During this pandemic, we have been working hard to ensure the safety of our employees, and I want to end by thanking them for their perseverance, creativity and passion and by thanking all of you for your continued investment in S&amp;P Global. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions. Chip Merritt Thank you. Just a couple [Technical Difficulty] We have a technical difficulty at this end. Can you hear me now? Operator, let's have the questions. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan Thank you. Wanted to ask about capital return. You talked earlier and last quarter about the limitations of buybacks until the deal closes. But you do have $4.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and it's building as you generate free cash flow every quarter. So after the deal close, should we expect a large ASR or a special dividend, or will capital return be far below the typical 85% of free cash flow in 2021? Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Toni. This is Ewout. Thank you for raising that point. Definitely, the way we look at our current cash balances is that this is temporarily elevated. We are thinking about the following in terms of what we are planning to do going forward. First of all, once we have an open window, the likelihood is low that the open window will be before the merger will close so that means after the merger close is more likely, what we will do is, first, we have an opportunity to catch up with respect to our capital return targets from the last few quarters because, clearly, we have not been able to deliver on those targets given these limitations. And then going forward, we have the new capital return target of at least 85%. So what you may expect is a kind of a catch-up after the merger will close and then ongoing, an increased level of capital return to our shareholders. I can't give you exact numbers and amounts so I can't quantify this for you. But philosophically, this is the direction of our thinking. Toni Kaplan That's great. I wanted to ask about index subscription. You're up 1% in the quarter. I think it was closer to about 10% last year. I think you mentioned a change in the reporting. But could you give a little bit more color on what that was? And also just broader, if you could just talk about the trends that you're seeing in index subscription like cancellations and pricing and competition. Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Toni, this was more a catch-up in reporting that we had last year first quarter, and this was due to what we call real-time reporting catch-up, which had to do with the change of some administration. And therefore, the period-over-period differential looked relatively small with a growth of just 1%. Strategically, this is definitely an area we would like to grow, so the 1% is unusually low and should not be the basis of what to expect going forward. We should expect much higher growth from data and custom subscriptions. And we would like to grow this because we think it's a good balance in the overall revenue mix for the index business, where we have, as you know, fees over assets under management, we have the derivative trading fees. And recurring revenue, subscription-like revenues in the index business is definitely an area we will grow as well. So unusually low at 1% and the expectation should be much higher growth going forward. Toni Kaplan Did anything come out of your index consulting from last year? Thanks. I'll stop there. Chip Merritt Toni, we're going to limit to two questions as always, please, okay, so that we get everybody involved. Okay? Thanks. Toni Kaplan Yes, sorry. Thank you. Chip Merritt No problem. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open sir. George Tong Hi thanks. Good morning. Ratings revenue saw a strong growth in the quarter. To what extent do you believe there was a pull forward in issuance from future quarters? And how does your outlook for 2Q through 4Q debt issuance and Ratings revenue change? Doug Peterson Hi George, this is Doug. Thanks for joining the call. Well, first of all, as you know, we saw a very strong increase in results in the first quarter. Just to give you a few numbers to put them in context. As an example, investment-grade in the US was down 17%, and you think about that being down 17%. At the same time, investment-grade in Europe was up 22%. High-yield in the US was up 111%. High-yield in Europe was up 53%. Structured finance globally was up 5%, but a couple of tidbits there. In the US, CLOs were up 63%, and in Europe, CLOs were up 300%. And bank loans were also up 70% as well. So, you could see a mix of different aspects of what were up and what were down. We think that in the investment-grade, both in the US and Europe, that there probably wasn't necessarily pull forward, to use that phrase, because you saw the 17% down in the US, but there was definitely an interest in investment -- non-investment-grade issuers as well as structured finance to look at the -- what they believe is going to be upcoming economic growth. Rates and spreads have been quite attractive. Spreads are at an all-time historical low in some cases or lows over the last two or three years. And there's also potentially some expectations that inflation starts coming in the market and interest rates will start going up again. But as you know, in our forecast that we just gave you, we saw at the original forecast that the corporates would be down about 9%. We now see them down about 7.5% for the forecast for the year. Financial services that originally were going to be up about 5%, we see them now up around 4%. It hasn't changed that much. Structured finance is where we saw a bigger swing, originally up 3% and up now about 6%. So, when you look at the total, we had originally forecasted that the issuance for 2021 would be down about 3% and now we think it's going to be about -- down about 2%. As I started off, it's always hard to tell what pull forward is and what's coming in this pull forward, but it's possible that there could have been some in the high-yield space in particular. George Tong Very helpful. And then just a follow-up with the Ratings operating margins. How do you expect those to perform as debt issuance normalizes from strong 1Q levels? Ewout Steenbergen Good morning George. If you think about the Ratings margins, we think about it as three data points. One is the full year margins last year, 2020, which was somewhere in the 62% at the 62% level. Then we look at it for the trailing four-quarter at this moment, which is around the 63% level, and then the quarter standalone was around 67% level. The 67% level is clearly elevated due to the surge in the issuance environment and shouldn't be seen as the new normal. We think that there is an opportunity to expand margins from the level that we saw in 2020 but not at the level of what you saw in the first quarter of this year. So, directionally, improvements but this quarter was elevated due to the reasons we just explained. George Tong Very helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari Good morning. My question was just on Market Intelligence organic revenue growth. I realize it was a slightly tougher comp, but could you maybe talk about some of the investment spend that you're doing and how that will help your topline specifically and timing of that? I know from a margin side, you've already talked about margins there being in the high 30s on a target basis. So, any thoughts on the ramp and the growth from all the investment spend you're doing there? And maybe any other areas to highlight? Ewout Steenbergen Good morning Hamzah. If you think about Market Intelligence, there were some reasons why the revenue growth was a bit lower this particular quarter. Think about the Desktop that has seen some uneven recovery in various regions, particularly, therefore, the COVID impact from 2020, impact from the past ACV. But what we are seeing is a really healthy commercial activity now, and therefore, you heard us guiding to still low to mid-single-digit growth for revenue -- for Desktop revenue this year and high single-digit growth for Data Management Solutions and Credit Risk Solutions. Specifically with respect to the growth initiatives, we're very excited about all the new initiatives and the investments we are making. We know that it always takes a bit of time to see the revenue ramp up, and of course, from an overall basis, these numbers are still relatively small. But think about that Data Marketplace is doing very well and we see very nice growth. Actually, the revenues in the first quarter were more or less the same of the total revenues we booked over the full year 2020. The same applies for SME, ESG, private company data. So, overall, I think, it's clearly very, very good initiatives, and we see a lot of traction. Overall, Market Intelligence growth is expected at mid to high single-digit for the full year 2021, so mid to high single-digit growth for the full year 2021, which we think is a very healthy growth for this business and clearly helped by some of those initiatives. Hamzah Mazari That's great. And then, just -- maybe just any thoughts on the China business and what you're seeing there in terms of gaining traction relative to your expectations? Aside from the pandemic, just sort of any color as to how big China could be over time, what you're seeing there in the revenue base today? Thank you. Doug Peterson Hamzah, this is Doug. And thank you for joining the call today. As you know, China is one of our most important strategic initiatives for the entire company. And we typically talk about Ratings, but we have other initiatives. We're investing with Platts. We're investing in our index business. And recently, we've had some very good traction with our credit portal from Market Intelligence. But let me give you a quick update on Ratings. Last year, we had 22 ratings that were issued in the full year of 2020, and this year, in the first quarter alone, we issued 18 ratings. We believe that the market participants are really interested and increasingly interested in the quality of the ratings themselves, the underlying ratings. As I've talked about over time, we've assembled a very, very strong team. The market is building up over time. We see that the market has started attracting more offshore investors as well as the foreign banks that are coming in with their wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries, which is bringing new capital and new approach to the markets. But what we're out doing is educating the market. We're doing literally hundreds of meetings a week. And when we have seminars or events when we've rolled out some new research, we're getting thousands of people joining that. One thing that I'm very pleased with is that -- in addition to having such a strong team, is that the ratings that we've done when you look over the last two years. We've now rated financial structured products, our first non-financial corporation, and the breadth of our ratings goes from AAA to BBB. We're getting a lot of really good attention, a lot of high traction to our websites, et cetera. So, we see China as a long-run investment, but off to a really good start. Hamzah Mazari Thank you. Doug Peterson Okay. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh Thank you so much. Doug or Ewout, I wonder if you could just contextualize. Like you've done an amazing job capturing kind of this default cycle as opposed to the last one, where there's a lot more disruption. What does that mean for the next cycle as you think about this in the business and capturing some of the more secular trends in the business? Doug Peterson Well, as we look out over the next few years, clearly, there's various factors that are important to us. As we showed you in the slides themselves, we think that the economy globally is recovering, although it's going to be a choppy recovery. You've got the US growing at 6.5% this year on the back of a very, very successful vaccination program. China is going to be growing at 8%. Actually, the government says themselves they're going to grow at double-digit, at a 10% rate. But you also see that Europe and India and some other markets might not be growing at a very quick rate. But, overall, given the pull of the US and China and other markets that are recovering pretty quickly like the UK, we think that the growth this year is going to be 5.5% globally. The following year is also going to be quite strong, because those other markets that haven't had the vaccinations yet will continue to improve as well. So, global growth over the next couple of years in the 4% to 5% range, which bode well for our businesses. One of the biggest trends we look at is and what we talk about is as markets become capital markets around the world. And the question we just had about China is an important one for us, as China savers move from just investing in real estate to putting money into financial assets, into pension, insurance and savings program. As foreign investors move into China, we're seeing a much more advanced capital markets. The European trends over the last couple of years, we've always talked about them, but they've been very strong the last couple of years. And we've seen them incredibly strong in the last couple of quarters and becoming more like capital markets. Now, one final comment. When we take a step back and we think about our strategy that's called Powering the Markets of the Future, it allows us to take all of the different capabilities of S&amp;P Global, whether it's the rating agency, it's the index business. And now when we think about the addition of the IHS Markit capabilities, we'll have -- right now, we'll move from -- up to 76% of our business will be coming from subscription or subscription-like recurring revenue services. That will give us some stability as we head into potentially high-growth markets over the next couple of years but as well any sort of choppiness that could come from either fiscal policy or coming out of the very low interest rate environment, et cetera. But we watch very carefully the external environment. We think our businesses are well prepared to support the growth of financial markets and our customers. And we always then incorporate that into our planning of where we invest and how we set up our budgets. Kevin McVeigh That's very helpful. And then, Ewout, real quick. Is there any way to think about how much the ratings mix contributed to that 67.5% margin like in terms of just the mix relative to what it is historically? Ewout Steenbergen It plays a bit of a role, Kevin. Because if you think about bank loans and high-yields, those are usually not on frequent issuer programs, so that helps from the translation of overall activity in terms of volumes and issuance to revenue. So definitely, mix has played a role here as well. Kevin McVeigh Okay. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks Kevin. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik Thank you. Good morning guys. I just had a quick question. You've, obviously, curtailed your buybacks, as you said, as you wait for the deal to close. But are you holding back on your M&amp;A pipeline as well, like presumably just tuck-ins? Would just be curious there. Doug Peterson Manav, let me take that. As you know, right now, the number one priority for S&amp;P Global is to successfully execute the integration program with IHS Markit after the deal closes. So we don't have an active aggressive M&amp;A program. If something came along in the ESG space in particular or if there was a fill-in for a new asset class for Platts to expand our energy transition or battery metals opportunity, carbon trading, things like this could be something we might look at, but those will be small tuck-ins. But right now, our major emphasis is on successful closing and successful integration of the IHS Markit transaction. Manav Patnaik All right. That makes sense. And then I just had one small follow-up, which is breaking out the shipping segment in Platts. Is there any particular reason for that? I mean, is there something we should be looking out for? Could that be a category that's really going to grow fast for you guys? Doug Peterson It's -- Manav, it's an interesting question. We had a lot of discussion around it. Shipping is becoming one of those areas where the markets are looking for news. And we've had a couple of instances over the last few months where the data and the analytics and the research from Platts have been in very high demand. If you recall, there was -- there's been a period where the ships are stacked up at ports like in Long Beach in California, around China, around Yokohama in Japan, where they're -- the rates have gone up, they've doubled, they've tripled. We also had the large ship, which was stuck in the Suez Canal. So not only is there a heightened demand for information about shipping, it's been in the news, and we felt like our very high growth rate there gives us an emphasis and a focus to continue to invest there and grow there. And it highlights for us, which is a very interesting area with a lot of implications for global trade, for energy transition, for climate. It's a great area for us to invest in, and we're pleased that we can break it out now. Manav Patnaik All right. Thank you guys. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open sir. Alex Kramm Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just shifting to the deal quickly. You made a comment that you've been spending more time with the teams from IHS Markit as this deal closing approaches. I know this is not the time for any updates to financial expectations, I assume. But anything else you can share with us potentially on the cost and revenue side where you may have just gotten more comfortable, new things that you've discovered as you've spent more time? I mean, it's been, I think, exactly five months now, so I assume there's a few new findings. So anything you can share would be great. Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Alex, this is Ewout. Definitely, a lot of work is going on with respect to the integration planning, getting to know each other, thinking about organizational design, thinking about future strategy. At the same time, these are still two independently run companies. The transaction hasn't closed, as you know, so these are two companies that are still independently functioning with their own management teams and with their own boards for the oversight. So we are working, I think, in a great way, in a very collaborative way with respect to the integration planning. Definitely, we're diving deeper in terms of the revenue synergies, the expense synergies, trying to build up what we have detected during the due diligence phase, trying to build this up bottoms up and get additional levels of comfort around it. Yes, I am not, as you already mentioned in your question, able to give you any new indication with respect to numbers. These are the numbers we're committed to, the $480 million expense synergies and the $350 million of revenue synergies. But we are working very hard to make sure that we're able to deliver on that. And further updates, we can provide to you after the merger will close. Alex Kramm Fair enough. Staying on a similar topic though. A few people asked about capital returns. When it comes to buybacks in the future, I mean, obviously, you've mentioned the new leverage target. And again, this is not a new thing. But I know there's been some hesitancy in the past of levering up just to buyback your stock. So can you maybe just remind us how your thinking may have changed there? Given that, I think, as Doug just mentioned very shortly ago, you're going to have your hands full, so there's probably not a lot of other things to do. So what's the appetite to fully leveraging up the balance sheet, after this period of not buying back your stock to accelerate that? Ewout Steenbergen Alex, as we always have said, we set a leverage range target. And once we fall outside of that range, we will take action to bring ourselves back within the range. The range has been increased. We were at 1.75 to 2.25 as a range as S&amp;P Global stand-alone. After the merger, that range will be brought up to two to 2.5 times. As you saw in our earnings announcement this morning, we're currently at 1.8. IHS Markit is slightly higher levered than S&amp;P Global today. So we need to see and look at the mix after we combine the debt base of both companies. But clearly, if we will fall below the lower end of the new range, we will take action. We will add additional leverage on our balance sheet to make sure that we have an optimal overall corporate financing structure. And if that means we have excess cash and excess capital going forward, that will be an opportunity to return to shareholders as well. Alex Kramm All right. Fair enough. Thank you very much. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Alex. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open, sir. Trevor Romeo Hey, good morning everybody. This is actually Trevor in for Andrew. Thanks for taking our questions. First of all, just on the Ratings segment, bank loans and high-yield both performed really well to start the year. You kind of talked about some of the market drivers already. Just wondering, since those two categories don't always move in the same direction, do you have any thoughts on the trajectory for both of them going forward the rest of the year? Do you expect them to both continue to see similar levels of strength? Doug Peterson  Hi, Trevor, this is Doug. Thanks for joining the call today. Yes, you're absolutely right, sometimes bank loans and high-yield do not move in the same direction. This time, they did. We look at a few of the key factors which drove that. Clearly, there is a lot of capital-chasing deals. We see that the M&amp;A pipeline has increased to a level which is it's not quite historic, but it's getting there, and there's a lot of M&amp;A pipeline that is out there. It's from a combination of private equity firms, strategic investments as well as the SPACs, and that brings along with it revenue for us, which is not just an issuance revenue from loans and from high-yield bonds. We also see from new issuer fees as well as Ratings Evaluation Services that comes from that kind of a pipeline. But we see going forward this year, as I mentioned earlier, the overall corporate sector, we think is going to be down with the investment-grade issuers not being very active in the market, especially in the US. And with the high-yield probably leveling out, we don't know exactly what's going to happen with rates and spreads. But you're right that they do usually move in opposite directions. There's one other point I want to make. There has been demand for loans from investors that are looking for potential increase in interest rates. You saw that the 10-year yield had started climbing over the last three or four months. And so there's a lot of demand from investors for loans, which are floating rate. They want to, in a sense, kind of hedge their interest rate exposure and have floating-rate exposure. So it's embedded in our outlook for the rest of the year and are -- as well as our -- what we see is our forecast for issuance. But you're right that they don't always move lockstep, and this quarter, they did. Trevor Romeo Okay. Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just kind of given some of the increasing focus on ESG, just wondering if you could talk about your energy transition practice within Platts a bit. Just how large is that business now? What's your outlook going forward? And then if there's any way the IHS resource business plays into the strategy there, I would just love to hear your thoughts. Thank you. Doug Peterson Great. Thank you. And I'll take that also. Well, first of all, we are very pleased with the progress we're making on our ESG franchise. As you probably saw last week, on April 22nd on Earth Day, we announced a new brand, Sustainable1, for our ESG efforts across the entire company. And it's -- as we call it, it's your single source of essential sustainability intelligence. Across all of S&amp;P Global, we're now coordinating our ESG initiatives, and we have over 500 people that are dedicated full time to this. But to dig a little bit deeper into what you mentioned about Platts. Platts is building up an expertise in energy transition as well as transportation, and you heard us talk about shipping a few minutes ago. And when it comes to energy transition, you think about the move from coal to renewables as maybe the end of the spectrum. But in between, there is a whole new set of opportunities for Platts to be looking at, many of them we're already in. Hydrogen is an example. We have a hydrogen benchmark. We're the first one with a hydrogen benchmark. There is something called clean oil. There's clean natural gas. What that means is that clean oil has had the entire value chain of the delivery of that oil has been rebuilt to ensure that you can capture all of the methane, that there's no leakage along the way, so there's ways that refineries are run, that storage systems and pipelines are run. And we're able to provide the research and the data and the analytics and the benchmarks against something like clean oil. We also -- in Platts, we mentioned earlier on the call about copper. There's a whole set of new metals, which are quite important to the energy transition. As an example, copper, which there's 175 pounds at least of copper in an electric vehicle. You also have lithium in the batteries. So these are areas where we also see a lot of opportunities for the benchmarks to be used from a combination of new power grids, from the metals that are in them, from the clean energy that is going to be clean transition energy. Finally, I'd like to mention that with the merger with IHS Markit, they also bring along a set of new products and services that bringing together will strengthen our ESG franchise. At IHS Markit, they have additional research that comes from their transportation business, which is going to be quite valuable for the Platts business in the energy transition. They also have a carbon registry. They've got a set of other carbon research products and then generally, other research and news on energy transition and ESG, which are going to be quite valuable to us. So we think we're very well positioned. We've just launched the Sustainable one brand. We have an organization in place with over 500 people. And we're ready to really start growing. Ewout Steenbergen And as a quick addition, Platts is already today the largest contributor to the overall ESG revenues of the company, so clearly, an important contributor to the overall strategy. Trevor Romeo Great. Thank you both very much. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Trevor Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open. Craig Huber Yes. Hi. Thanks. My first question on costs, can you just give us a broad sense of how much cost you think will come back into the system for T&amp;E, other general office expenses once people start coming back and you get back to a normal workflow in the company? And how many hundreds of millions of dollars you think that might add on an annualized basis? Ewout Steenbergen Good morning. Let me give you a couple of data points here. First, pre the COVID pandemic, in 2019, we spent on overall T&amp;E $85 million as a company. Last year, we spent $15 million. But clearly, going forward, what we would expect to be the new normal with new ways of working, hybrid working, more virtual tools, it's correct that we wouldn't expect the whole $85 million to come back. Our best estimate would be maybe a haircut of, let's say, 25%, so maybe around $60 million or so that should be a T&amp;E kind of level after the whole COVID situation is over. Some of the benefits of that are already captured in our productivity program. So a part of the $120 million productivity program. But clearly, we expect overall more efficiency due to a different way of working going forward and the lessons that we have learned of being able to operate over the last 12 months to 15 months. By the way, the same applies to real estate. We clearly expect also real estate expenses to come down. We don't need the extensive footprint that we have today because we would expect people to be spending, less days at the office going forward. And also the benefits of that are already captured in the productivity program, the $120 million productivity program. Craig Huber And then, my last question, please. Can you just talk about the pricing on average for this year in your non-indices businesses? Is it sort of up 3% to 4% over normal range you have year-in, year-out? Ewout Steenbergen We're always careful to talk about pricing going forward, as you know, Craig. But nothing is different than what you should have seen historically from what we're doing in our businesses. And I think that should be overall, in general terms, the expectation across the company. Craig Huber Great. Thanks guys. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Craig. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open sir. Owen Lau Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So I have a question about Trucost. I think State Street just announced a strategic engagement with Trucost. And President Biden also committed to cut greenhouse gas emission in half by 2030. I'm wondering how all these have impacted your Trucost business and also your outlook. If you can talk about the recent traction there and also the opportunities ahead, that would be great. Thank you. Doug Peterson Great. Thank you, Owen. Let me take that question. Well, when we think about the energy transition and now in a much more broad way. And you look at all the different initiatives going on around the globe. One of the most important dialogues that we have no matter where we go -- any meeting I go to, whether it's with central bankers, ministers of finance, it's with corporate bankers, investment bankers, with corporate executives, people are talking about energy transition, they're talking about climate and they're talking about ESG. And we see that there is a need for people to have clear, simple, concise, comparable, consistent data and analytics around climate, around ESG. As you know, we did an acquisition of Trucost about 3.5 years ago, and it brought to us, the premier set of data and analytics around carbon, around climate, around physical risk as well as waste, water and other types of analytical information. We also have physical risk. We have SDGs, sustainable development goals as ways that we can do analytics on that. But going to your -- the first part of your question. We just announced an agreement with State Street, where we're providing them information from Trucost that can be embedded in all of their modeling. All of their clients will be able to use that intelligence and that risk information and build it into State Street's existing client-focused ESG services. State Street has about $40 trillion of clients -- of assets under management that their clients hold. So we're going to be able to be providing that functionality. What it does is? It allows those clients to have access to the carbon footprint and other environmental data that will map to their portfolios. As you know, a lot of organizations are increasingly using the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure reporting. And you can take the Trucost data, the Carbon Earnings at Risk, the Paris alignment, the physical risk data, the general carbon information and build it right into that kind of modeling. So we're very pleased with that partnership with State Street. We see this as a start of many, many other partnerships and something that for us is quite important and one of our most important strategic initiatives in the entire company. Owen Lau Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe switching gears a little bit to the index business. You have a partnership with Lukka and the potential launch of a global cryptocurrency asset-based -- asset index. Could you please talk about your thinking about the product launch and the revenue model there in your index business, participating in the crypto space? Thank you. Doug Peterson Yes. It's another one of those areas. It's not nearly as far along as something like ESG is. Crypto is just, just starting. And we feel that it's such an important asset class, it's on everyone's minds, that we needed to do some specific research around crypto. And one of the groups where we can do that, where there's a lot of relevance is within the index business. So this actually goes back for more than just the last few weeks or last few quarters. We've been researching crypto for a while and hadn't felt that it had the seriousness and the ability to be hedged, the ability for crypto to be really understood, to be traded, to have the liquidity in it. It was quite speculative, and we had not launched any products up until now. We haven't launched any products yet, we're close to. But because crypto is becoming more mainstream, it's beyond just Bitcoin. There's many other sources. They're -- that you can trade them on other exchanges. There are some companies now that have listed that are crypto companies, that have the standards of being a listed company. You've got -- some of the exchanges have started having futures and forwards. You're starting to see some of the conditions that would allow us to develop some products. As of now, our revenue model would be similar to the revenue model we have on other indices, which would either be AUM-based fees or it would come from data that we would sell to the markets that could use the data from a product or an index like that. But an area that's quite promising, but it's really -- it's starting at zero. So I can't give you much of a projection of what the revenue might look like, because it's starting so low, but something that we feel like we need to be understanding and learning and building into our portfolio of products. Owen Lau That’s very helpful. Thank you, Doug. Doug Peterson Thanks, Owen. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open, sir. Jeff Meuler Yes. Thank you. So you obviously have a fantastic margin expansion track record over many years, while investing in innovation, and obviously, that continued this quarter. IHS Markit also has been expanding margin. And you've given us post-deal synergy targets. But I guess my question is did the expense synergy targets incorporate running similar productivity programs that you've run at S&amp;P in recent years at IHS post close, or would those types of productivity programs be incremental to the targets that you've provided? And if so, does it appear to be a significant opportunity for you? Ewout Steenbergen Jeff, good morning. First of all, welcome to the call. Jeff Meuler Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen And thank you for initiating your coverage of S&amp;P Global. We're very pleased with that. With respect to your question about our expense management philosophy, first of all, both companies today already have philosophies in place. As you know, we have our productivity program on the S&amp;P Global side, where we're aiming now at the $120 million goal of cost takeout. And IHS Markit is having a particular target with respect to margin expansion of 100 basis points on an annual basis. What we are planning to do once we bring the two companies together is to, of course, focus on the overall expense synergies that we have mentioned to you before. That's going to be a large program. In order to achieve that, that's a period of two to three years that we are fully able to achieve those expense synergies, although the ramp-up will go fast. We are probably in year two at a level of 80% of the expense synergies. But philosophically, on top of that, you may expect us to continue to look at opportunities where we find scale across all of the different divisions that we'll have going forward. As you know, we are in a business where scale really matters, particularly with all the technology investments that are needed, and we have an opportunity to leverage that across the company. We also will continue to benefit from operating leverage, just the benefit of growing your top line faster than your expense line. The incremental margin on the next dollar of revenue that comes into the company should always be higher than your average margin, because you don't have your fixed cost that you need to cover anymore. So philosophically, you may expect us to continue to be very focused on taking benefit of efficiencies and scales on top of all the existing programs and commitments that we already have in place. Jeff Meuler Okay. And then on Platts, it's had this resilient and good mid-single-digit growth through some pretty challenging end markets. You mentioned a healthier customer base. And I guess the Platts oil forecast remain above $60 per barrel through 2022. Does that allow you to take an even more aggressive posture on price or create more growth opportunities for you to potentially break out of the mid-single-digit growth to the upside at some point? Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen Again, Jeff, we don't talk about future pricing, but let me give you a little bit of a color and perspective of what we are seeing within Platts at this moment. As you mentioned, very healthy revenue development during the quarter. If you think about the recurring part, the subscription part of the business, it was growing 6%, a little bit held back by the Global Trading Services. But that is understandable because Global Trading Services was really elevated in the first quarter of last year, a little bit similar to the ETDs within the index business. When the markets show a lot of volatility, there's a lot of trading, hedging that is happening. And the hedge programs are helping the GTS revenues to go up.  But if you look at it in perspective, GTS was, in fact, higher on a stand-alone basis this quarter than the last three quarters itself. So nothing from our perspective as we look at GTS that we think that, that wouldn't be helpful going forward. It's just that the comp one year ago was so high. So all-in-all, if you put it together, we see healthy developments, good retention rates in the mid-90s, good commercial activity. The book of business, that is building up well. We like that. The ACV and subscription level is at that 6-ish percent at the moment.  So overall, mid-single digits is the outlook for Platts for this year in terms of revenue growth. But overall, incrementally, we are definitely positive on the outlook of this business given where are the commodities markets and the health of the customer base as well. Jeff Meuler Understood. Thank you. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir. Unidentified Analyst  Hey. Good morning. This is Ryan filling in for Jeff. Just had a quick question. Did the SPAC boom create any incremental need to issue debt? And if so, do you know what the contribution of the SPAC frenzy was to debt issuance or your ratings revenue in the first quarter? Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Ryan. If you think about SPAC activity, that is definitely helpful at multiple levels for the ratings business. First, it can help with Ratings Evaluation Services activity. Then it can help with new entity ratings fees. And then thirdly, it will ultimately lead to new issuance, and that is helpful as well. So we think the SPAC activity definitely is overall an important and good element of the overall M&amp;A market and will help ratings at multiple different levels. Unidentified Analyst  Thank you. Doug Peterson Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Ryan. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Judah Sokel with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Judah Sokel Hi. Good morning. Thank you. You mentioned $21 million of ESG revenues in the quarter. I was trying to think about does that number reflect your total ESG initiatives. Or is it possible that there is some level of ESG products and services that are kind of embedded in other products that might just be increasing, reinforcing the value of those products, but not necessarily driving incremental revenues or necessarily unpacked in that $21 million revenue number? Ewout Steenbergen We believe it's a pretty complete level in terms of our overall revenue base. Obviously, we have very clear definitions of what we think should be contained with respect to ESG and energy transition and what's not. We actually have built, as you have heard, a horizontal organization across the company that touches all of the different divisions.  We think ESG is such a great initiative because it is really being driven by all of the parts of S&amp;P Global today and actually even being helped also in the future with the parts of IHS Markit that are joining the company. And we have now so-called insight on a horizontal basis of our revenues on the -- on an ESG level as well as we start to think about what it does from an overall P&amp;L perspective.  So we're pretty comfortable that this is a complete number. $21 million is clearly north of 40% growth year-over-year in terms of our ESG revenue base. So we are still very comfortable that 40% CAGR that we have mentioned to you in the past is still achievable. Judah Sokel Okay. Great. No, that's really clear. My other question is just about Platts. You highlighted all the different commodities that you've expanded into, certainly expanding, diversifying beyond just petroleum. And in the past, you've talked about not being too worried about peak oil, that it's still many years away, a couple of decades potentially.  But I was thinking about it maybe from the other perspective, which is that maybe a move away from petroleum could be beneficial for you guys just from the standpoint that quarter-after-quarter, it seems that the other -- some of the other asset classes are growing faster than petroleum for you. And now you've broken out shipping, which is another potentially fast-growth area. So is it a situation that maybe as the market moves into some of these other asset classes, your growth rate could pick up in Platts, or is it just perhaps cannibalizing itself and it will stay the same in that mid-single-digit area? Thank you. Doug Peterson Well, thanks, Judah. The way we look at it is that what's critical for us is to be the most relevant benchmark, research, analytics, news organization for commodity solutions. We think about it as you just described. The peak oil is going to be a while away. People still forecast that could be 8, 10, 15, sometimes people say even 20 years away. It depends a little bit on some of the programs around the world for energy transition and climate change.  But when we look at that, we believe that there will be a lot of different types of services and commodities that are going to be taking the place of what is today oil that's used in transportation and manufacturing, et cetera. So that's one of the reasons we've invested in our ESG products and services. We also look at power grids. We're looking at renewable energy, at power generation. As you've heard us over time, we've also expanded into agriculture. We've looked at metals and mining. So we think that there's two aspects to this. One of them is the diversification, generally speaking, of taking the expertise we have in commodities and expanding that to other commodity classes. And we hope that, that brings us growth over time. And then the second is filling the gap of the needs of what's going to happen in climate and energy transition and moving very rapidly and aggressively into all of the spaces that will be the opportunities there like carbon registries, carbon pricing, hydrogen, etcetera. So it's kind of two different angles on the same way. It's the growth horizontally, and then it's filling the space for all of the opportunities related to ESG. Judah Sokel Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Samir Tiluca [ph] with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get an idea of the scale of the technology transformation program that's going to be involved in integrating all the technology programs across the two companies. So I'm wondering if there's any way to quantify that in terms of how you're tracking it in terms of number of projects or teams and just to get a sense of how does it compare in scale with the S&amp;P Global platform initiative that you've been working on? Doug Peterson Well, thank you, Samir, for joining the call. When you look at our overall program for the integration with IHS Markit, there is a major emphasis on technology transition, and there's a few different categories. The first is what I would start with that relates to just pure infrastructure, how do we run our rails, who are our major service providers of our desktops, of our communication services, of our cloud. And so there's a program on that is -- provides us the way that we run our business and everything around the business. And as you know, at S&amp;P Global, over the last four years, we have put in place a centralized program to manage our data centers, our cloud transformation and all of that. And we're able to take that learning and also take what IHS Markit has done along the same way and very quickly look at a program to bring all of that together. The second aspect of technology relates to delivering services to customers, and that's where we have a very similar approach, where within the businesses, we have development teams, client services teams, client experience teams. And we're working on looking at the merger of those organizations in the divisions; as an example, like the Market Intelligence and Financial Services division. There's a whole set of work streams around how are we going to use the Desktop, which is the Market Intelligence/CapIQ Desktop; how are we going to use the workflow and the service and products that IHS Markit has and how you take the data and how you work those together. So that's a whole another set of work streams that we have. And then the third work streams relate to risk management, cyber risk. And we have an absolutely aligned attitude and policies on ensuring that we always operate at the highest standards of risk and control and compliance, as well as ensuring that we're ahead of any sort of cyber risk. And then the fourth is data sciences and artificial intelligence, natural language processing, etcetera. We have Kensho, which has been a fantastic organization that joined S&amp;P Global three years ago. And what they've been able to achieve is really unprecedented. And we talked right now about NERD on this call. But as you know, Kensho has had a really strong track record at S&amp;P Global. And at IHS Markit, they have the data lake, and as well, they also have data sciences teams as we do across all the businesses, so thinking about that community of data sciences and ways to think about the most modern approach to running technology. So we have teams working in parallel, working together across all of those different work streams. We think this is one of the advantages of the scale of the business overall. We can really take advantage of large global scale and technology, and we can also take advantage of large global scale of our data science, of our machine learning, our natural language processing. And so we're very excited. This is going to be one of the most important upsides of working with IHS Markit. Unidentified Analyst Great. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up on that. I mean you've been working together over the past five months with all teams interacting with each other. Any surprises you have come across in the things you described in terms of work streams in like infrastructure and data or analytics flows between the two companies? Doug Peterson There have been no major negative surprises. But there's a lot of positive surprises, that many of the areas that we knew from the outside or saw as either clients or competitors or understanding how their products work together, we've seen that there are some really, really high-quality products. There's high-quality people. We think that the complementarity – the way that our products complement each other are quite strong. So we see that there are some really, really exciting opportunities. We are all waiting to be able to get together to learn more about the businesses once we can operate together after the transaction closes. And so we're all very excited about this. It's -- for us, as I said earlier, our most important strategic initiative this year is to have a smooth integration and a smooth close on this transaction. And all the surprises are in areas that we're just so excited and we get more excited the more we learn and in particular, the more we learn about the people. So if you don't mind, let me wrap up the call. First of all, I want to apologize for some of those sound glitches we had earlier on the call. It was something that – oh, do we still have another – we have another question. Sorry about that. Operator Thank you. Our last question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in. Doug, I'm going to make it very quick. It's just a piggyback question on something from before. Just in terms of the SPAC market and its importance for issuance, for ratings. If we see a real slowdown in the SPAC market either because of legislation in the US or because of freezing of the pipe markets or anything like that, should we expect that that's going to have a material impact on issuance, or do you think there are corporates that have been kind of waiting in the wings and if some of the valuations come down, they would be ready to step in and it should not make any material impact? Thanks. Doug Peterson Yeah. I don't think there would be a material impact. We are – we've got people – our staffing model is quite strong. We've got a team, and we like to keep our team ready. In addition, you recall that every time we do a rating, we have surveillance that goes along with that rating over time, which means that we always have a certain level of activity to ensure that we're always watching the market quite carefully. And we have formalized programs around surveillance. It's not just something that's done randomly. So I would think that we have a very strong staffing team. We don't want to lose all that expertise we have. Shlomo Rosenbaum Okay. Thank you. Doug Peterson Okay. Well, thank you, Shlomo. Well, again, let me wrap-up the call. And I want to apologize for some sound glitches that happened along the way. I think we were able to get those fixed at some point. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter and our prospects for our strategic initiatives. We've talked about ESG, about China, about the merger with IHS Markit. But I want to go back to where I started and one of the things that Ewout said, very importantly, our people. They continue to show an unparalleled commitment during very difficult times, especially as the third wave of the pandemic hits countries like India, where we have a large group of employees. So we want to thank all of our employees. And I also want to thank all of you who joined the call today for your support. Again, thank you very much. Operator That concludes this morning's call.

And welcome to the Q1 2021 IHS Markit Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Boyer Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 2021 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q1 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers, which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are not a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit’s filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Jonathan Gear, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions. With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance. Lance Uggla Okay. Thank you, Eric. And just before we start the call, we do have a moment of silence for all of those who have passed from COVID over the past year. This has taken place at the moment in our UK offices. And I’d just like to pause for a moment here to respect all those that have passed and people that we know and love and friends and family that may have been passed away through the pandemic. So if we could just take a moment silence and then get started. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Eric. And thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 earnings call. We started the year with a very strong set of Q1 results, which provides a great foundation for the full year. Q1 revenue was $1.12 billion, with organic growth of 3%. Adjusted EBITDA of $467 million and margin of 41.7%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, an adjusted EPS of $0.71, up 8% over the prior year. Overall, we are pleased with the start of our year and now expect to deliver results in the upper half of our 2021 guidance. In terms of our core industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had record organic growth of 10% in Q1. Within Financial Services, Information had another quarter of solid organic growth of 6%. Main contributors included increased demand for our pricing, reference data and valuation services, as well as continued growth in our SFTR reporting platform and indices businesses. Solutions had a very strong quarter with 15% organic growth, driven by solid performance across our Solutions businesses. Increased capital market issuance and greater adoption of our corporate actions, private markets, and reg and compliance offerings were all significant contributors. We continue to expect Solutions to be a large growth contributor for the full year. Finally, our Processing business grew 6% organically, with strength in loans and derivative performance as expected. For the full year, we now expect Financial Services to be in the higher end of our 6% to 8% targeted organic growth range. I just want to congratulate the team on that record 10% quarter. That's the first time record since Markit went public and IHS Markit together that we had a 10% quarter. So congratulations to everybody. Moving on to Transportation, which had organic revenue growth improved to 4% in Q1. As expected, we continue to see the rebound across our businesses at varying speeds. We’re particularly pleased to see our recurring revenue growth improved to 8% in the quarter. Our dealer facing dealer facing experienced strong growth across CARFAX and automotiveMastermind, with revenue growth rates approaching pre-COVID levels. New business was strong across the portfolio in Q1, and we remain confident about the outlook for the rest of the year. Also in Transportation, our Maritime &amp; Trade business had a very good start to the year, which was in line with our expectations. We also hosted a successful virtual TPM conference in March. We expect strong new business and retention performance will drive an acceleration of recurring revenue growth through the rest of the year. For the full year, we now expect Transportation’s organic growth to be in the 13% to 15% range, which is up from our original 12% to 15%. Moving on to Resources, where organic decline was negative 10% in Q1. Our Resources business is playing out as expected. In 2020, given the industry conditions, we put into place a number of drivers that should help us return to growth in 2022. As expected, our ACV has bottomed in Q1 and expect for it to slowly recover through the rest of the year, which bodes well for 2022 recurring revenue. Our downstream organic revenue growth performed as expected and should accelerate through the rest of the year. In the beginning of March, we held our CERAWeek conference, which had over 19,000 participants. Even with the virtual event, we were able to bring together leaders in the energy industry, world governments, finance and technology to discuss the future of energy. We also hosted a successful virtual World Petrochemical Conference. In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within Resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in low single digits, as upstream improves and downstream continues its growth trajectory. Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was in line with our expectations of negative 1% for the quarter. We expect improving results across Product Design, TMT and ECR to continue through the year. For the full year, we still expect CMS to deliver mid single digit organic growth. Now on March 11th, the shareholders of both IHS Markit and S&amp;P Global overwhelmingly voted to approve the merger. We are working with the relevant regulatory bodies and still expect a second half close. And now I’ll turn the call over to Jonathan. Jonathan Gear Great. Thanks, Lance. Q1 results included revenue of $1.12 billion, which represents organic growth of 3% and total revenue increase of 4%, with recurring growth of 4%. Net income of $149 million and GAAP EPS of $0.37. Our adjusted EBITDA of $467 million, an increase of 8%, with margins of 41.7%, this represents margin expansion of 180 basis points. And we also delivered adjusted EPS of $0.71, an increase of 8%. Regarding revenue, our Q1 organic growth of 3% included recurring organic growth of 4% and non-recurring organic decline of 7%. This decline in non-recurring was primarily driven by lower automotive OEM activities, lower energy consulting activities, and transactional content purchases for upstream and product design when compared to Q1 of last year. Moving on to segment performance. Our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 10%, including 9% recurring in the quarter. Solutions, in particular had strong performance, delivering 15% organic growth, primarily from strength in equity capital markets, corporate actions, and reg and compliance offerings, and strength in our core portfolio monitoring management tools, while information and processing each had a 6% organic increase, driven by pricing and valuations and loan market activities, respectively. Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 4% in the quarter. This included growth of 8% recurring, as Q1 had strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses. Non-recurring revenue declined by 8%, primarily driven by continued lower activity in digital marketing and recall. Our Resources segment had 10% organic decline, which is comprised of a 9% recurring decline and 20% non-recurring decline. Q1 organic ACV decreased by $7 million in the quarter and our trailing 12 month organic ACV is down 11%, as we have largely cycled through our subscription renewals since the North American energy market was severely impacted at the end of Q1 last year. Our CMS segment had 1% organic decline, including 2% increased recurring and a decline of 25% non-recurring. Moving now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $467 million, up $35 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8% with a margin of 41.7%, up 180 basis points. Moving on to our segments. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $233 million, with a margin of 48.1%, up 100 basis points. Financial Services margin was driven by strong revenue growth, while supporting continued investment. Transportation’s adjusted EBITDA was $147 million, with a margin of 47.1%, up 740 basis points. We do expect margins to moderate to - in forward quarters, as we see more expense tied to revenue growth. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $74 million, with a margin of 36.6%, a decrease of 340 basis points, as a result of lower revenue. CMS adjusted EBITDA was $26 million, with a margin of 21.5%, down 250 basis points. This quarter decrease was primarily driven by mix shift, which we expect to improve during the year. Adjusted EPS was $0.71 per diluted share, an increase of 8%. Our GAAP tax rate was 17%, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%. Q1 free cash flow was $172 million. As a reminder, Q1 is seasonally our lowest free cash flow quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. Our Q1 ending [ph] debt balance was $5.1 billion, and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7 times on a bank covenant basis and 2.6 times net of cash. We closed the quarter with $172 million of cash, and our Q1 undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.022 billion. Our Q1 weighted average diluted share count was 401 million shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&amp;P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares. And therefore, our share repurchase program is currently suspended, other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share based compensation. Moving to guidance. We had a great start to the year, and now expect to deliver results in the upper half of our 2021 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, which include the following, revenue of $4.535 billion to $4.635 billion, with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, including recurring organic growth of 6% to 7%, adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.03 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points when adjusted for FX, an adjusted EPS of $3.11 to 3.16. Finally, we expect cash conversion in the mid 60s as we lap our 2020 one-time cash impacts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance. Lance Uggla Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. It was a great start to 2021, which puts us on track to deliver strong full year results. I want to thank our colleagues for their continued focus and dedication during the challenges of the pandemic and as we work towards closing the exciting merger with S&amp;P Global. With that, we’re ready to open up for questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question. Kevin McVeigh Great. Thanks so much. And congratulations on the great results. Hey, Lance or Jonathan, could you unpack maybe just within Financial Services, you gave really good detail there. But the 10% organic growth overall, it was just really outsized growth in non-recurring. And want to get a sense of, given that strength, does that impact the overall business as you think about it over the balance of the year both on the non-recurring side and then some of the more episodic issues as for core Financial Services business? Is that a structural step-up as you think about the business? Lance Uggla So were you - you're referring to Financial Services 10% organic growth? Kevin McVeigh That’s right, Lance. Lance Uggla Yeah, to just take the breakdown. Okay. I’ll pass that to Adam and he can give you a bit breakdown of the 10% and where the real strong parts are and what he sees on the go-forward as well. Adam? Adam Kansler Sure. Thanks. So yeah, we’re obviously very pleased with the quarter. We’ve built strong platforms and strong capabilities in a few markets that have really seen strength through Q1. We do expect some of that strength to continue throughout the year, particularly in equity capital markets, you saw a very strong first quarter. Second quarter continues to look strong. We’ll see what the balance of the year brings. And similarly, in some of the loans markets, we’ve seen strength as well. So we feel pretty good about the core businesses. They continue to grow at the rates that we’ve targeted, in some cases, towards the higher ends of those targets. With the addition of strong capital markets, that gives us the opportunity to deliver a double-digit quarter like we did here. I’d love to say, we’ll continue that you know, into the future. We’ll see what the future brings. But it’s about - just really about positioning our product to take advantage of those opportunities when the markets are strong. Lance Uggla Okay. Thanks, Adam. Also, the private markets performance and performance generally across Solutions as asset managers are assessing their cost structures has really been a strong tailwind for the team. And it’s great to see the Solutions teams back to 15%, which we hadn’t seen for a while. So, great results all around. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Manav Patnaik Thank you. Good morning. Lance, I was hoping you could help just provide some of the key takeaways from CERAWeek when you look out over the next couple of years and maybe 3 to 5 years. You know, there’s obviously a lot of movement. And I was hoping some of those insights could help us just figure out what the trajectory for Resources is? Lance Uggla Yeah. Okay. No, that’s a great question, Manav. So the first off, I guess when you look at the agenda for CERAWeek, you see a strong formation of discussion in plenaries around energy transition, which is a step away from the big discussion around climate change. And when you think about how the world is responding now with the new Biden administration, with the COP26 coming up, you know, real strong support for the 1.5 degree pathway. And I think that positions IHS Markit’s energy team very, very well for the energy transition associated growth that’s going to come as the industrial participants start to shift gears and look for how they might participate in their businesses with respect to energy transition. That being said, it was pretty clear from the CERAWeek discussions that 100 million barrels a day is still a level of demand post-COVID that is in the crosshairs of what needs to be supplied. And therefore, our upstream business will need to continue to support and play an important role in the provision of the fossil fuels needed, as the world’s transitioning towards 2050. So I think we win both ways, thought leadership, a player in the upstream to support the required supply, and a team that’s working very hard to transition itself through the solar, wind, hydrogen storage solutions and a variety of other activities that are expected to decarbonize our world. So I think we’re doing a good job. I think CERAWeek to me, really sung a story of energy transition stronger than it ever has. And I think we’re well-positioned to get the new growth and to maintain our contracts that we’ve managed through 2020 to longer term and a bit lower price. And so, we’ll see the slightly negative impact through this year. And I’d expect mid single digit growth as we go into 2022. Brian, do you want to add to that at all? Brian Crotty No. Yeah, I just think the team did a great job taking you know, the physical event and migrating into a virtual event. And we’re looking forward in October to having a physical event in India, and of course, next March. But, I think you’ve hit all the high points with energy transition, ESG, clean tech, carbon capture. All of these things that our customers are looking forward to, we’re in a good position to help them. Lance Uggla Okay. Thanks. Hey. Thanks, Manav. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Gary Bisbee Hey, guys. Good morning. So the question I continue to get asked most as it relates to the pending merger is just for a bit more granular color on synergies within some of segments. I guess with Adam slated to run Market Intelligence, I wonder if he is got any more thoughts or Lance you do, just to give us a little more color on where you see the big opportunities merging your Financial business within S&amp;P, you know, either on the cost side, or maybe more importantly on the revenue side? Thank you. Lance Uggla Okay. Well, maybe I’ll start and then hand that to Adam given he is right engaged in that post-merger integration discussions. But one thing I can say is that the cost side of the equation has been very well mapped out. Teams are aligned, and my view is that that’s the low-hanging fruit over the next couple of years. And both teams are very focused on making sure they can deliver the results. The exciting side, of course, is the revenue opportunities that Doug and I spoke about. And we see substantive opportunity for revenue synergies. And the teams have started to map them out. They are meeting regularly. And maybe for Financial Services, to start, Adam, you want to chat, and you can probably add the index side in as well. Adam Kansler Yeah. And I really would refer you back to when Lance and Doug talked about it in the merger. Those core areas that were identified upfront continue to be the core areas of opportunity, whether it’s in bringing together multi-asset class benchmarks in our index franchise, the scale of data assets that we can make available to customers and more efficient delivery to those customers. The combined ESG capabilities and assets of the business, the strong ability to play a role in private markets, an area growing quite rapidly, and our deep knowledge of underlying company financials, as well as the tools that are used by the private equity and private credit industry to manage their portfolios. And then, of course, a significant set of data and capabilities around credit and risk looking into the supply chain of customers. So all of the areas that were identified upfront, as we’ve gone through a more extended period of discovery, proven out to be quite significant opportunities for us forward. I think in the coming months, the teams will update publicly our views on synergies. It’s still early to do that. We’re still in a regulatory approval period and still in a discovery phase. But it’s – you know, as we dug in more and more, all of the expectations that we had have proven out. Gary Bisbee Thank you. Lance Uggla Thank you, Adam. Next question. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. You may proceed with your question. Jeff Meuler Yeah. Thank you. Question on Transport, so the recurring looks particularly good to me given that it’s still a tough comp, and I think you effectively lost a year or two price lift in that business. So is that the broader Mastermind product suite that’s resulting in more cross-selling or what’s driving that? And then on digital marketing, is it an environmental factor from your perspective where they just haven’t leaned back in yet, or is there some initiatives to improve the positioning of your business that we should be watching for? Thanks. Lance Uggla Edouard? Edouard Tavernier Right. And hi, Jeff. Thanks for your question. And you are right, the story of the quarter is our recurring revenue growth. We’re very happy with it. It’s developing according to plan. And it shows the strength of the underlying business, and it should strengthen throughout the year. What's driving it? I think it’s the - our core products, right? So if you look at the CARFAX offerings, if you look at the Mastermind offerings, or if you look at some of our core subscription products like supply chain and technology, all of these businesses are growing significantly and are showing good resilience in the first quarter. On the digital marketing side, so what we’re seeing is advertising spending is coming back relative to where it was two or three quarters ago. But it has not yet resumed to pre-COVID levels. Why is that? A couple of reasons, but one of the big ones is low inventories. The supply chain is still catching up and trying to rebuild inventory levels in particular in the North American market. And when inventories are low, advertising spend tends to be lower. And we’re still seeing this in the industry today, and we will see subdued inventory levels for the next couple of quarters at least. And that’s why advertising spend and digital marketing spend is still not quite where we would like it to be. We are seeing strength in the business. We are - activities far higher than it was two quarters ago. So we expect digital marketing to be stronger as the year goes by. Jeff Meuler Thanks. Lance Uggla Thanks, Edouard. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may proceed with your question. Alex Kramm Hey, good morning. A quick one on the updated guidance. It sounds to me like financials and automotive doing a little bit better, and then the other business is kind of in line with expectations. Can you also talk about how FX has impacted your outlook change? You got a small benefit in the first quarter. But since then, I think, some of the major currencies [ph] have moved in kind of opposite direction. So just wondering, how much, if any, FX benefits are driving the guidance to the higher end of the range? Thanks. Jonathan Gear Sure. This is, Jonathan. I’ll jump and answer [ph] that question. We certainly are getting some benefit of FX at the top-line on revenue. That will impact some of the forward words we're saying about guidance being at the upper end of the range. However, lot of that is just core operational improvement that we’re seeing from AFS [ph] that we continue to see from Transportation and also the - as the outlook for the rest of the year for both Resources and CMS. You should also note, Alex, because you know, we get a benefit from - at the top end from FX, it does impact our expenses. And so the – as the improvement you’re seeing from EBITDA is really a reflection of both, of FX impacting both revenues and expenses. So the EBITDA and EPS flow through is I would call core operational improvement. Alex Kramm Very good. Thanks. Jonathan Gear Thank you. Lance Uggla Thanks, Jonathan. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Steinerman Hi. Within Resources, could you tell us, if the non-subs business, like the Energy Consulting business and other non-subs business has lifted off the bottom yet? And kind of what is the nature of what IHS is doing for the industry as the industry recovers, in terms of non-subs? Brian Crotty Yeah, hi. This is Brian. So yeah, the - so the consulting business is already - is bouncing back. When we look out forward, we’re going to be having double-digit growth even in upstream on consulting, which is a good sign for us, because, usually, when consulting bounces back, then you have your subscriptions following. Andrew Steinerman Okay. Thank you. Lance Uggla Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. Hamzah Mazari Hey, good morning. Thank you. My question was just around the market serve JV with CME. I know you have that listed as assets for sale. Any mechanics we should be thinking about, on that particular JV? And, as it relates to sort of the larger merger? Thank you. Lance Uggla Adam, you want to answer that one? Adam Kansler Yeah. I think, that's a combination that we've talked about for a couple of years, in looking to pull together some of the core assets in the industry around post-trade processing and really not related to the merger. It wasn’t done in anticipation or in connection with that. It was really part of a larger strategy around maximizing the value that assets set. It will continue to be an important part of the business. We’ll look to continue to leverage it, in terms of data sets and opportunities that will come out of making that process much more efficient for our customers and those joint offerings. So I think it continues to be complementary to the combined business, but no direct connection. Thanks. Lance Uggla Thanks, Adam. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question. Ashish Sabadra Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a solid quarter. Just a question on the robust margin expansion that we saw in the quarter, we’ve seen several quarters of this margin expansion. My question was - are there further opportunities for cost takeout and accelerate the margin expansion? And this is more through some structural changes within IHS Markit itself? Thanks. Lance Uggla Maybe I can start, Jonathan, and then you can add. So, first off, we have a strong view at IHS Markit, and that will carry on with the strategic merger, that there is a opportunity to continue to see Resources, especially through this new understanding of the virtually - virtual world, to see Resources in some of the better cost locations that we operate in. And that can be within North America, within South America, India, Eastern Europe, Europe and the Far East. All of our major centers are - have close proximity to some better cost on or offshore locations. So location plays a big role. The second thing that’s playing increasingly big role is technology and the use of technology to manage our more operationally-focused jobs and that also gives us a continued opportunity for margin expansion. So as we look forward, we see that 100 basis points of margin a year, as one that we can continue to support. And there will be opportunity for margin expansion in the combination as well. Jonathan, do you want to add to that at all? Jonathan Gear No, Lance. I think you covered it really, really well. I guess, the other thing I’ll just add on top of the cost levers that you’re always pulling, is, of course, we get the natural benefit of the scalability of our revenue as it comes through, which helps with that lift. But, Lance, as you said it well, I think, we see very clear path to 100 basis points at that suggested for this year. Lance Uggla Okay. Thank you. Ashish Sabadra Thanks. Lance Uggla Thank you. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. You may proceed with your question. Shlomo Rosenbaum Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, Lance, can you give us a little more insight on the - how the sales are going from, like, the Data Lake going commercial and how the new product innovation is going? Some of the stuff that you’ve been building to kind of generate the flywheel momentum for years into the future. Is there any like quantitative info you can share or, if not, just qualitatively. Lance Uggla Yeah. What I can say is, is that - and if Adam, Edouard or Brian want to add anything after this, they can. What I’ve been impressed with is the pipeline, the growing pipeline and connectivity to the Data Lake, and the assessment of the Data Lake as a new way to consume data from us more efficiently. But also to reach some broader contracts, especially around the hedge fund community, where quantitative and qualitative decision making from vast quantities of data, you know, it’s some of the bigger hedge funds that have those tools and have those capabilities. We’re also seeing some mid-size vendors and some corporates [ph] who have been grappling with their own construct of a Data Lake, where they can leverage us as a technology platform to be able to, not just provide them our data, but to provide them connectivity for their own and even distribution for their own. So some very strong discussions that are starting to lead to revenue. There is paying customers for the Data Lake now, and that starts to grow. Edouard, do you want to add to that. How you're using it within automotive? And then maybe, Adam, you might want to do the same on AFS [ph]. Edouard? Edouard Tavernier Yeah. Sure, Lance. And I’ll address the broader point about kind of innovation, product innovation. I think that is the story, right, over the past 3 or 4 years. We measure internally - we use a metric recall with the vitality index, right? I don't think we publish it. But we measure the contribution of new products to our growth. And for division like Transportation, that contribution has increased year after year over the past 5 years. New products and high growth products are an increasing part of our kind of overall revenue growth.  To give you an example, right, in concrete terms. And if you look at our Maritime and Trade business, it’s always owned a number of incredibly valuable kind of legacy data assets. But over the past 3 years, it has repositioned essentially a data business into a solutions business targeting risk management workflows, trade compliance workflows, commodities analytics workflows. And through this transformation has become essentially a high single digit growth business.  A lot of these innovations have been enabled by the Data Lake and which strongly reduces the product development life cycle. So it’s certainly a good innovation story there. Adam, I don't know if you want to add something? Adam Kansler Yeah. I guess what I would add is, we’ve been pretty excited about the uptake and adoption of our catalog, which allows customers to integrate our data sets over 1500 data sets in the Data Lake today into their own data sets. We’re seeing that uptake, not just in asset managers, but also in corporates, banks and obviously, other parts of the buy side. One of the interesting aspects of their discovery of our data sets is the vast amount of, what you’d call alternative data you know, that’s within those data sets, which we’ve always believed had strong value, as more and more clients adopt our catalog and ability to access the Data Lake that seems to be proving out. We do have paying customers today and we do see the pipeline forward. And I think we’re also particularly excited about how that will come together, as we down the road finalize the S&amp;P merger and think about their marketplace and how all of these data sets can come together in a really efficient and exciting way for our customers. Lance Uggla Thanks, Adam. Brian, do you want to add from energy, some of the initiatives you’re using the Data Lake for and how it started to drive opportunity? Brian Crotty Sure, yes. So first of all, one - just to support what you said. So we do see a nice pipeline of, especially chemical companies and banking companies looking into the Data Lake for solutions they perhaps can’t get in other places.  Like Edouard said, when we’re looking at developing kind of clean energy, clean tech products, we can go into the lake and take information both from what we’re doing, what other - what our customers are doing. So it’s just a good place where we can shorten product development life cycles to build out things like emissions and things that our customers are interested in. Lance Uggla Okay. Thank you. And just to remind everybody, when I think back to the IHS Markit merger, we said two things about building out the Data Lake over the coming years. One, that it would give us efficiencies in terms of managing our own content, which we see through margin expansion. But secondly, that would give us opportunities for distribution, combination of data with customers and third-parties and give us a real competitive edge in our ability to sell and distribute our content. The piece that I think is additive to all that, that we’re starting to learn about is more that there are significant numbers of larger customers who want to be able to interrogate large data sets to identify decision-making signals and decision points. And that’s been leading us to some of the bigger quantitative hedge funds, but it also exists within the corporate world for analytics and analysis. So I think we’re well on our way to gaining the efficiencies and we’re starting to see the revenue follow through as well. So a good story. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. George Tong Hi, thanks. Good morning. In the Transportation business, dealers saw strong growth in Automotive, Mastermind and CARFAX. Can you discuss trends that you are seeing among your OEM customers? Edouard Tavernier Yes. Hi, George. This is Edouard. So the OEM customers last year had a slightly different cycle to the dealers in the sense that in Q2 they were operating sort of more normally. But if you will, the COVID crisis really hit them in Q3, and they are still recovering from this. So today they are doing much better. As you know, demand for vehicles is picking up significantly in the US and globally in 2021, as is production. The one caveat I would bring is that the supply chain is still adjusting to this post-COVID world. So the - some of those supply chain issues have been well-documented, in particular the semiconductor shortages. And they have led us to revise our 2021 forecast down by 0.5 million vehicles. So that is a temporary kind of shock, but it is a shock nonetheless. And it's slowing down the recovery of inventories in Western markets. There are some other challenges, right? So there was a bout of severe weather in the southern US a few weeks ago. That has actually created a shortfall of chemical feedstocks. That’s also impacting the supply chain. There was a fire last week in Japan in a major semiconductor plant. So all of these are sort of impacting our customers. But in the end, it’s delaying the recovery, but the recovery is coming back. We’re in a good place in the sense that we are supporting OEMs and suppliers with some of these secular structural transformations in the industry, and those are multi-year transformations, and our data and our solutions are critical to helping them. So slower recovery, but recovering nonetheless and the outlook for the industry is positive. Lance Uggla Thanks, Edouard… George Tong Got it. Lance Uggla Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. Toni Kaplan Thank you. Sort of a long-term question for you, Lance. Your business spans a number of end-markets that are going through significant industry changes. You’ve talked about the energy transition. And also within Transportation, there seems to be a shift more towards technology long-term. And I know you are providing companies with solutions to help them with these changes and shifting their strategies. I guess can you just talk about what this means within IHS? Is this - does this mean selling different products to your existing customers as these changes take place? Do the traditional datasets become sort of less used, but new datasets receive more demand? And does this enable more up-selling to existing customers, but also opportunities to get new customers, maybe technology players, et cetera, as these changes take place? So any color there would be helpful? Thanks. Lance Uggla Okay. That's a good – that's a good question and one that definitely encompasses our strategic vision. And for all my team, they are very focused on the impact of the changing marketplaces around us that are being driven by either technology or a quest for decarbonization, and therefore, participating in a change in net zero world as we look forward. So you have to take those and go, are we going to be able to participate and take revenue from that and adjust our business positively? Or are we going to find that we get dis-intermediated because some of the revenue streams will shrink? So our strategy is very, very clear. If you look in Transportation, you are seeing it right now in Maritime and Trade, and you see it in our strong automotive recovery. And that is, is that, when you look at those revenue streams and you dig into them, you start to see how they are shifting their customer base to new solutions, new platforms and new decision making tools. And within automotive, we are an independent supplier of information that helps people make decisions. And the world – the automotive world has got more complex. And it will continue to get more complex, as we look forward, given this drive towards net zero. So I feel like the information sets around automotive are very buoyant and participating and forecasting in good or bad markets is a good thing. The second thing I’d say is that Mastermind, when we’ve acquired Mastermind, I think it was around $80 million of revenue. It’s now running towards $120 million this year. And that’s getting driven because Edouard and his team have taken the Mastermind platform, married it with Polk data, married it with CARFAX data, took full views for the OEMs. And the OEMs for the first time are saying, Geez, why do I want to provide a incentive that blankets the US? Why don’t I target market at right down to post codes, or even right down to individuals? And that’s where the Mastermind platform, which we called an enterprise Mastermind, is adapting to this new digital world, and even a world where there is less dealerships in the car just lands in your driveway. So we want to participate in that, and the team is doing a great job shifting. There is some other ones in around automotive, but I’ll shift for a second. Maritime, there, the shift is the new services. It’s supply chain, it’s decarbonization. It’s – you’ve got all the Maritime fleet information. All of your suppliers that are trying to be ESG compliant need to know what’s the carbon footprint of the delivery of my goods? And so we’re now producing a full carbon fleet analysis for our customers, and that’s a growth area. It’s being driven from the Data Lake. It’s new technology. It’s just old products adapting to new worlds and making sure we’re participating. If you go over to Energy, I think we covered that. Energy, we’re going to have to make sure that we maintain the upstream you know, $250 million to $300 million of revenue. And the rest of the revenue, we’re going to have to grow as the Energy markets transition. And we’re very well positioned. We do consulting around all those services, that’s helpful. We know where the assets are, so that’s helpful for global warming. We know where the pipelines are, the distribution. We have a lot of data that plays into the new world. And we’re transitioning and growing our solar, wind, hydrogen, battery storage businesses, and this is a growth market. So it's going to be a tough. For the Energy folks, this is going to be a year where it’s tough because we gave discounts last year and they got to recover into next year. But I think that by the time they get to 2022, they might be the darlings again in the company, and you’ll see somebody else on their back. And then Financial Services, I think we’re in all the right growth markets. So there, I feel good about it. And I don’t want to leave CMS out because, sometimes, we do, but RootMetrics, which is small, I know, but they are into 5G, and 5G is important. And if you go over to the CMS product design folks, their pipeline is all about digital transformation and focusing on the vast amounts of specs and standards that need to be added together to in-house documentation for engineers to make decisions. And we’re playing that game with our digital platform, and we’ve got a great pipeline because we can save people money. So net-net, I think, for a great – great people, a great company. We’re well-positioned to get our share. The question always is, is IHS Markit, now S&amp;P Global, will they get their share of the growth in TAMs that are substantive? And my bet is, yes, of course, they will. They are filled with great people and great customers and therefore there’s lots to do. Toni Kaplan Thank you. Lance Uggla Thank you. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Jeff Silber Thanks so much. At the beginning of the call, you mentioned the very successful CERAWeek. And I’m just curious how these virtual events compare to your in-person events in terms of economics and profitability? And going forward, what do you think your strategy is going to be on the event side? Lance Uggla Well, what I can tell you is that the team - the team has found that they can profitably manage virtual conferences. So they’ve done that. We have three of those, TPM, World Petrochemical Conference and CERAWeek. And all of them had record audiences. So the - and the audiences can be record because everybody’s online virtually. So instead of 4 or 5, 000 physical conference seats, you can have tens of thousands of virtual seats. People are willing to pay for top quality content and access to the right audience. And we had all the right audience. We had top government officials, new US Energy Minister, John Kerry, in his new climate envoy role. We had Bill Gates. We had heads of pharmaceutical companies. We had technology, big sessions on hydrogen. It really was impressive, and we’ll see that growth come into our next quarter. And it was - all as I can say is the team was well-ahead of their plan and pressed all of us in all three events, and we’ll give you those numbers next quarter. So, I think worst case scenario is we’re always virtual and we’re going to get better and better at it and grow from there. Best case scenario, which I think we’re all hoping for, is we get to be back together in rooms and feel safe, and can network and build relationships like humans like to do. So, let’s hope for the second. But if the first comes, it’s not going to hurt our growth path. I think the teams have proven they can make money and grow. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Nicholas Hi. Thanks for taking my question. With respect to the merger, a lot of focus has been paid to the cross-sell and new product opportunity for the Resources and Financial Services businesses. But I wanted to ask what that might look like for Transportation. What do you see as the major opportunity there? And since I believe one component will be to sell Transportation data and research through the Market Intelligence platform, I am wondering what are the specific client types already on that platform that make the most sense in terms of consuming that information? Thanks. Lance Uggla Edouard? Edouard Tavernier Hi, Andrew. Yeah. This is Edouard. Thanks for your question. So, yes, you’re spot on, right? We have unique proprietary automotive content. That content is highly valuable to the investment community and the financial community as a whole. We made some significant progress since the IHS and Markit merger 4 years ago in monetizing these data assets. But we’re still in the early stages of a fairly long growth runway. So, if you look at the Market Intelligence kind of customer base, there is very, very strong penetration in the investment community. That will be our number one target. But there are also pockets of other customers which are potentially highly valuable for the order business. So, that’s the idea where we’re working hard to refine these assumptions and some more of this later. Lance Uggla Thanks, Edouard. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Jeffrey Thanks. I appreciate you squeezing me in towards the end. It’s remarkable to see the strength in FI [ph] Lance, can you talk about any thoughts per investing for above trend revenue growth? I mean, do you take opportunities around, for example, robust capital markets activity to plough excess back into the business? And if so, where are those areas of focus you think could support above trend top-line growth down the road? Lance Uggla Right. Well, so in financial markets, we can start there. And we have made acquisitions to support our private markets activities this year. We made an investment in one of the world class fund admins in - you know, that support the alternative space. We see substantive synergies and opportunities there to invest in our reporting services like iLEVEL and the integration of those products into the administration side. So, that’s an investing side. IHS Markit, and now S&amp;P Global, Adam’s teams are investing with PIMCO, Man Group, McKinsey, Microsoft, and others around a product called HUB, which they will ultimately consolidate back into their Solutions businesses. That’s all about new technology and efficiencies for asset managers. So, yes, continued investment. When you get over into the automotive world, I mentioned already the enterprise Mastermind, which is the broader OEM platform, that’s been an investment through COVID. CMS has been investing in the digitization of their business. And - all of these lead me to the so the upper half of our growth range if executed well. You know, I was really pleased. I’ve never seen a 10% quarter probably since 2014 or somewhere before that. So to see a 10% quarter in FI [ph] if things coming back that – its your normal businesses performing, you know, at 5% to 6% growth range, but then your new investment areas, which are big into solutions are performing at – you know, above their ranges. And that sometimes is volume, but in this case, it’s a lot of the new product development and the hard work the teams have been doing. I think in energy, it speaks for itself. It’s renewables. Its – you know, we acquired the agriculture business, ag and decarbonisation, they all kind of go hand-in-hand, land use in this new world that we head into. And I think the teams are investing. They are adding people. They are investing in their businesses. And we only - we give 100 basis points margin, but there is more than enough opportunity through the revenue side and cost management for us to create investment dollars. And all the teams are doing that. I’ll pause here and go to the next question. Andrew Jeffrey Thanks. Operator Thank you. And I’m not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to the company for any further remarks. Eric Boyer We thank you for your interest in IHS Markit.

However, this call is intended for investors and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Dave Guarino at 212-438-1471. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug? Doug Peterson Thank you, Chip. Welcome to all of you joining today’s earnings call. The first thing I’d like to do is thank our people at S&amp;P Global for their dedication and commitment throughout 2020, as the pandemic continues to take its toll across the globe, our people remain focused on supporting each other, our customers and our communities. Together, they continue to provide relevant, timely benchmarks, data, and research to help our clients navigate through this turbulent economy. So to all 23,000 of you, let me say thank you. Now, let me turn to the key financial achievements in 2020. S&amp;P Global delivered 10% organic revenue growth in 23% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. All four businesses contributed with growth in both revenue and adjusted operating profit. We generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow, excluding certain items and returned $1.8 billion through share repurchases and dividends. In addition to the very strong financial results, we made significant progress on our key initiatives as well. The expertise in technology that we’ve developed over a number of years enabled the creation of new products, product enhancements, and productivity improvements. By funding growth investments to leverage our technology, we were able to deliver the largest collection of new product launches I can remember. We also continue to expand our ESG and climate product offerings, including the new S&amp;P Global ESG scores. I’ll share more about all of these new products in a moment. Another highlight was the completion of our Investor Day productivity target as we surpass the target and achieved $120 million of annual savings. Upon completion, we then initiated a new $120 million program in October, which is targeted to be completed in two to three years. There are two common questions that investors have been asking for years. What will your results look like in a recession? And do you really have any more opportunities to improve margins? I think 2020 went a long way in answering both of those questions. To recap the financial results for the full year, organic revenue increased 10% to $7.4 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 18%, our adjusted operating profit margin increased 310 basis points to 53.3%. In addition shares outstanding decreased 2% over the past year, contributing to the 23% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. Ewout will review our fourth quarter financial performance in a moment. I’m particularly pleased at all four businesses contributed to the company’s overall revenue growth and adjusted operating profit improvement. Ratings led the way with organic revenue up 15% and its adjusted operating profit margin of 460 basis points to 62.4%. The only business with a decline in its adjusted operating profit margin was S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices at 69.1%. This is primarily due to higher legal expenses, ESG expansion and incentives. It’s important to remember that our 2020 financial results are part of a solid track record of performance. Over the past four years, we’ve posted a compound annual growth rate of 7% for revenue. We have average more than 250 basis points per year of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. And this has resulted in more than doubling of our adjusted diluted EPS over that timeframe. We also made large strides in non-financial metrics in 2020 by enhancing the company’s environmental performance and improving our social outreach. We issued our second annual TCFD report featuring 2019 carbon-adjusted EPS. We secured approval from the science-based target initiative for our new target to reduce absolute scope one and two greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2025. This is from a 2019 base. We’re targeting to achieve net zero by 2040. We supported work from home arrangements with flexibility for those simultaneously caring for children or elderly family. We enhanced benefits for sick leave, global care leave and days off for volunteering efforts and wellness and the contributions by the S&amp;P Global Foundation increased 170% to $11 million. These donations support COVID-19 relief, racial equity, social justice, economic inclusion, environmental sustainability, and gender equality. We’ve also made substantial progress on our external ESG initiatives. ESG revenue reached $65 million in 2020, a 40% increase over 2019. The new product launches in ratings are all getting momentum with the number of ESG evaluations, green evaluations and SAM benchmarks shown here. We also saw an increase in 220 companies completing the corporate sustainability assessment. These assessments are integral to much of our ESG effort. Market Intelligence launched numerous products including S&amp;P Global ESG scores covering 7,300 companies and true cost climate analytics and environmental data that contain environmental data on 15,000 companies. These are both available on the Market Intelligence platform or is a data feed. In Indices, ESG exchange traded funds assets under management increased by more than 200% to $20 billion and the year was filled with new ESG indices being introduced and our customers creating new ETFs and options. In Platts, the energy transition is becoming increasingly important. We continue to support the markets with new price assessments for commodities like battery metals and hydrogen. Last year, we told you about the shipping industry moving to low sulfur fuel and our launch of new low sulfur marine fuel price assessments. There are now a range of related future contracts based on our prices with open interest growing steadily. We also continue to advance our China initiatives in 2020. We introduced Mandarin language versions of both Ratings360 and the Market Intelligence platform. We released a beta version of the China Credit Analytics Platform. This is an integrated desktop solution that generates credit insights on public and private companies using unique content and localized analytics aligned with the S&amp;P Global standards. We completed nine public ratings in the fourth quarter, including the first non-bank corporate rating bringing the 2020 total to 2022 ratings. We completed our registration enabling ratings and exchange bond market, which accounts for approximately 40% of the total number of bond issuance in China. It’s also encouraging that the Chinese bond market continues to develop. We continue to see positive signs from the Chinese regulators who are driving change in the local credit ratings markets. In addition, following several recent high profile defaults, there’s an increased sensitivity and awareness among local market participants to the quality of credit ratings. Internally, 2020 has been dubbed the year of new product launches. I can’t remember a year with so many launches. This was a direct result of the increase in investment spending over the past two years combined with our exceptional technology expertise. The launch has included marketplace, the Snowflake partnership, RiskGauge, ProSpread and the Platts Platform. All of which we have discussed on previous earnings calls. There are two new items we haven’t discussed yet. The first is the launch of S&amp;P Riskcasting Indices, which use artificial intelligence to adjust the weighting of equity and fixed income positions in response to market signals. The second is the S&amp;P Kensho Moonshots Index, which measures a company’s propensity to innovate. The index excludes the mega cap technology names instead focusing on the next generation of innovative companies. In addition Ratings360 launched comprehensive data models and tools for the CLO user base and enhanced content for international and U.S. public finance. While we included the S&amp;P Kensho Moonshots Index on the last slide, we needed a separate slide to cover all of the new products, product enhancements and productivity improvements Kensho developed in 2020. These include omni search on the Market Intelligence platform, high-speed revamp of the Platts market on closed process, utilizing AI publication times for assessments reduced by an average of 80%. We’ve converted 66 markets to the Kensho MOC process already, and we’ll continue to migrate additional markets in 2021. Kensho extract, which enables information to be replicated exactly astound an original document. Kensho’s indices have also made great progress with the spider S&amp;P Kensho New Economies Composite ETF ending 2020 with over $2.3 billion in AUM, a tenfold increase this year. We’ve made several Kensho solutions available on our recently launched marketplace. The first is Kensho Scribe, a tool enabled us to create 36,000 transcripts last year while expanding our corporate coverage by 1,500 companies. This tool is now available for our clients to convert speech to text. The second is Kensho Link, a tool that enabled us to have data sets on 11 million entities from CreditSafe, Preqin and IPQwery. This tool is also available to our clients to help link data sets. Taken together, cognitive automation from Kensho Link, Kensho Scribe, and several other machine learning tools have delivered an estimated 700,000 hours of savings. While we have developed exceptional technology capabilities among our IT community, we’ve also made great strides to expand technological skills of all employees. A great example is robotic process automation or RPA. Employees from around the company, you’ve embraced RPA, taken internal classes and created their own bots generating an estimated savings of 300,000 hours in 2020. While all of the work that we do internally is what drives much of our success, key industry trends also help. The shift into passive investing continues. This chart shows the cumulative U.S. equity flows of $1.8 trillion in the past 10 years. And we are prime beneficiary of this trend. If we look at ETF AUM associated with our indices, there has been an almost 150% increase over the past five years to $2 trillion. Over the long run, we believe this trend will continue. The increase in global issuance has been another positive trend for the company. While 2020 issuance in aggregate increased 13% as is often the case, there were pockets of strength and pockets of weakness. Global investment grade and high yield were the strongest categories increasing 26% and 27% respectively. This is due to incredible activity in the U.S., which increased 53% and 66% respectively. Meanwhile, both structured and leveraged loans lagged in 2020. The market clearly favored high yield issuance over leveraged loans in 2020 besides the decline in leveraged loan issuance in the U.S. and Europe. This slide depicts the percentage of loans that we rated, which was 91% in both the U.S. and Europe. I’d now like to shift the presentation to our outlook for 2021. Let’s start with the latest view from our economists. They’re forecasting global GDP growth of 5% in 2021 with growth accelerating during the year as vaccinations proceed and lockdowns recede. They believe fiscal and monetary policy will remain very accommodated and flexible. While the correlation between GDP and issuance was severed by the pandemic, we expect a long-term correlation to remain intact. The latest global refinancing study was issued earlier this week. The total amount of global debt matured in this study is $11.3 trillion over the next five years. This is up 5% from the $10.8 trillion highlighted in last year study. The chart on the right depicts a global high yield debt maturing over the next five years. It’s almost to $3 trillion of 20% from $2.5 trillion last year study. This bodes well for future high yield issuance. After issuance growth of 15% in 2019 and 17% in 2020, our ratings research group anticipates that issuance will decrease 3% in 2021. The forecast calls for gains and financials and structure 4% and 3% respectively and decreases in non-financial and U.S. municipals issuance of 9% and 5% respectively. Please note that this is an issuance forecast not a revenue forecast. Despite the forecasted decline supporting factors in 2021 include favorable financing conditions, increasing amounts of sovereign debt with negative yields and renewed M&amp;A pipeline for corporations. On this slide, I want to share some of the key initiatives that we’re focused on in 2021. Asia and China in particular, continue to be attractive markets for new product development and expanded capabilities. We want to continue to provide customers with new offerings including S&amp;P Global platform, additional indices solutions, expanded Platts products and broadening Ratings360 coverage to additional issuer categories. We also want to focus on innovation and technology. We will do this by bolstering our data and systems capabilities to support growth while leveraging technology for new products and improve customer experiences. And we will continue to enhance our data extraction and ingestion capabilities. We’re especially pleased to integrate our company-wide ESG offerings, creating new ESG products and extending our existing ESG coverage universe. The most important initiative of the year will be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit. This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our company and our customers. The combination of S&amp;P Global and IHS Markit creates a strong company will have increased scale and world-class products across numerous core markets with a track record of deploying cutting edge technology to accelerate our powering the marks to the future strategy. The pro-forma company will serve a global customer base across financial information services, ratings, indices, commodities and energy, and transportation and engineering. Together, we will offer differentiated data, analytics, research and benchmarks, important to the workflows of many of the world’s leading companies and governments. We expect the combined company to deliver EBITDA synergies of approximately $680 million resulting in a highly profitable combined company with continued opportunity for margin expansion. The acquisition is expected to generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted cost of capital after full synergy realization consistent with our M&amp;A. For the employees of both companies, we will combine two best-in-class workforces and deep expertise and complimentary cultures focused on serving the global needs of our customers. I’m incredibly proud of the team we built at S&amp;P Global and I look forward to welcoming the talented IHS Markit employees to S&amp;P Global. There are three parallel paths that are underway to close the transaction and prepare for the combination. The first is shareholder approval. The Form S-4 was filed and became effective last month. This enabled us to establish record dates and schedule shareholder meetings. Both shareholder meetings are scheduled for March 11. The second is regulatory approval. We’re working toward regulatory approval in the countries listed. We continue to expect closing the second half of 2021. The third is pre-close integration planning. We have created integration teams focused on day one readiness. These teams are developing plans that focus on organizational integration, real estate consolidation, technology scale and efficiency, cross-selling and new product development. And we’ve created a value capture work stream, similar to what we established in our SNL acquisition to pursue and track synergies. The new company will have six businesses. Martina Cheung will lead Ratings. Martina will also be responsible for leading ESG across the company. Adam Kansler will lead Market Intelligence and Financial Services. Saugata Saha will lead Platts and Resources. Dan Draper will lead Indices. Edouard Tavernier will lead Transportation. In addition to being CFO, Ewout Steenbergen will lead Consolidated Markets and Solutions. And after the merger is closed, John Berisford will lead all of our integration efforts together with Ewout. I’m optimistic that S&amp;P Global has a great future as a standalone company with exceptional assets, technology and people, combining our company with IHS Markit makes for an even brighter future. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who’s going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout? Ewout Steenbergen Thank you, Doug. And welcome to all of you on the call. Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Organic revenue increased 6%. Adjusted Corporate Unallocated expense decreased 21%, primarily due to the timing of charitable contributions, lower professional fees and the reduction in the company’s real estate footprint. Adjusted total expenses increased 11% and I’ll come back to this on the next slide. Adjusted operating profit margin decreased 150 basis points due to the increase in total expenses. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the successful resolution of various tax audits and true-up prior period taxes. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% and adjusted diluted EPS increased 7%. While total adjusted expenses for the full year increased 4%, for the fourth quarter they increased 11%. This was primarily due to increased incentives as a result of strong 2020 financial performance, expenses related to the acquisitions over Greenwich Associates by CRISIL and the RobecoSAM ESG data and analytics platform and investments in growth initiatives and productivity programs. The non-GAAP adjustments this quarter collectively generated a net pre-tax loss of $247 million. They included $138 million associated with office lease, equipment and software impairments, $55 million in restructurings across the company, $24 million in IHS Markit merger costs, $2 million for Kensho retention-related expenses, and $29 million in deal-related amortization. Determination of office and equipment leases and the restructuring actions will result in annual savings of approximately $70 million. Approximately $20 million of the savings apart of the new $120 million productivity program, the balance is related to separate business efficiency initiatives. This quarter, all four deficients delivered increased revenue with Indices achieving double digits growth. As I explained earlier, due to increased costs, adjusted operating profit margins were generally muted. For the full year, Ratings and Platts delivered superior adjusted operating profit margin improvement, Market Intelligence increased slightly with elevated investment spending and Indices decreased slightly, primarily due to higher legal expenses and ESG investments. Each year on our fourth quarter earnings call, we share changes in our headcount. In 2020, headcounts increased 2%. This year, we separated enterprise technology headcount from corporate headcount. Corporate was the area with the largest headcount increase at 16%. This was the result of insourcing about 130 order to cash positions resulting in annual savings of several million dollars. The only other area that had an outsized to increase was Platts, which increased headcount 5%. This was due to investment spending to expand their commercial presence in Asia and funds their benchmark acceleration program, as well as insourcing of IT contractors. Last year, we shared this slide and estimated that we would invest $150 million in growth initiatives in 2020. The projects that make up this total are listed on the left. We ended up spending $139 million, which was still an exceptional level of activity for the company. For 2021, we expect investment spending to moderate to $100 million. This activity coupled with the merger with IHS Markit should to keep the organization fully engaged with exciting new projects and opportunities. On our third quarter earnings call, we introduced a new $120 million productivity program to be completed over the next two to three years. I’m pleased to report that we’re off to a fast start, the $49 million of run rate savings already achieved. These were mainly from reduced real estate and changes to IT contracts as well as investments made to permanently reduce T&amp;E. These run rate savings do not include the $20 million benefit from the impairments and restructuring actions taken at the end of 2020. Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet has low leverage and surplus liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion. This is temporarily higher than necessary and will be reduced when we resume share purchases, debt of $4.1 billion and undrawn revolver capacity of $1.2 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA is consistent with our current leverage target. Free cash flow excluding certain items reached $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $714 million or 28% over the prior year period. In 2020, the company returned $1.2 billion to repurchase 4 million shares and pay dividends of $645 million. In aggregate, we returned 55% of free cash flow, excluding certain items. This fall short of our target 75% as we head to curtail share repurchases due to the merger. If there’s an open window and we have an opportunity, we will repurchase shares before the merger closes, if not, we anticipate resuming share repurchases after the merger is completed. Now let’s turn to the deficient results, starting with S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The segment delivered 10% revenue growth, primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices and data subscriptions. In the fourth quarter, we reported an 8% increase in adjusted expenses, primarily due to incentive compensation true-ups, increased headcount and application development spending, and 11% increase in adjusted segment operating profits, and adjusted segment operating profit margin of 68.5%, an increase of 50 basis points. On the trailing four quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 69.1%. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices delivered growth across all revenue channels this quarter, asset-linked fees increased 12% with gains in ETFs and mutual funds, exchange-traded derivative revenue increased 3%, data and custom subscriptions increased 7%, due to an increase in end of day ACC. Activity at the CBOE decreased in the fourth quarter with S&amp;P 500 index options activity decreasing 13% and fixed futures and options activity decreasing 1%. This was in contrast to increase activity at the CME, where the equity complex volume increased 58%. Almost all of the gain at the CME was due to the successful launch of the Micro E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures. Excluding this product, the volumes at the CME equity complex were essentially flat. Market intelligence delivered organic revenue growth of 7%, which strength in both renewals and new business. Usage of our key market platforms increased 13% year-over-year. Adjusted expenses increased 10% due to incentive compensation true-ups and higher commissions and royalties. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 2% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 30.7%. On the trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 32.4%. Looking across the market intelligence components, desktop revenue grew 5%, excluding acquisitions and divestments. During 2020, market intelligence delivered significant enhancements to the MI Platform. These included improved visualization of customizable dashboard, integration of Kensho Omnisearch and upgraded mobile experience and the cloud based infrastructure for better performance. These enhancements help us meet the needs of many platform users and position us well for continued execution against our integrated desktop roadmap. Data Management Solutions revenue grew 10% and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 8%. Ratings reported revenue increased 7%, organic revenue increased 5%, excluding the acquisitions of the ESG data &amp; analytics platform from RobecoSAM and CRISIL’s acquisition of Greenwich Associates. Adjusted expenses increased 17% primarily due to incentive true-ups and acquisitions. This resulted in a 1% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 370 basis points decrease in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On the trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 460 basis points to 62.4%. Non-transaction revenue increased 15%. Organic non-transaction revenue increased 11%, primarily due to fees associated with surveillance, frequent issuer programs, Rating Evaluation Service on increased M&amp;A activity, and high-end new entity credit ratings activity. Transaction revenue was relatively flat as increases in bank loan ratings revenue were offset by a decrease in bond issuance compared to a very strong fourth quarter of 2019. As we have seen time and time again, the various parts of the ratings business often move in opposite directions with some up and some down in any given quarter or year. This quarter non-transaction revenue was strong, while transaction revenue was unchanged. Non-transaction revenue is generally a steady source of growth, but the broke out to the upside in the fourth quarter. About the one-third of the organic growth in the fourth quarter was from surveillance fees and frequent issuer programs that are more occurring in nature, about one-third was from large jumps in RDS and new entity credit ratings, which we expect to continue to be strong in 2021 and about one-third was from other items. This slide depicts ratings revenue by its end markets, the largest contributor to the increase in rates revenue was an 8% increase in corporates. In addition, financial services revenue increased 6%, structured finance decreased 6%, governments decreased 3%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 8%. On the right side of the slide, you can see the changes in revenue within structure products. The largest change was in CMBS, which was due to a 64% decrease in global CMBS issuance. And now turning to Platts. Reported revenue increased 5% with core subscriptions increasing 6% and global trading services decreasing 5%. GTS revenue decreased mainly due to lower natural gas and iron ore volumes, partially offset by increased LNG volumes. Also due to COVID, our conference business revenue was down about $1.5 million in the quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 7% due to incentive true-ups and growth investments. Adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 100 basis points to 51.7%. The trailing four quarter adjusted segments operating profit margin increased 230 basis points to 54.7%. The fastest growing categories during the quarter were petrochemicals up 18% and power and gas up 6%. Petrochemicals had a favorable comparison to a weak fourth quarter 2019. We recently filed the S-4 and received a handful of questions about the document. They were generally related to the two topics on this slide. The first question was, if the 2021 standalone adjusted diluted EPS in the S-4 was our guidance. If not, the $12.36 figure in the S-4 assumes that we will continue to repurchase shares in 2021 as a standalone company. However, as we have stated, we think that it is unlikely to oversew share repurchases before the merger with IHS Markit closes. Therefore, our 2021 guidance assumes no share purchases. The second difference is that the S-4 figures were based on our October internal forecast. Our initial 2021 guidance is based on our most recent internal forecast, which has improved outlook primarily due to increased growth in ACP and our subscription businesses and AUM in our Indices business. The second question was, why the cash flow figures in the S-4 differ from the figure stated on the merger conference call and our normal free cash flow reporting. These are two different views of free cash flow. The S-4 provides an unlevered free cash flow forecast typically utilized to value companies via a discounted cash flow analysis. The difference between the unlevered free cash flow in the S-4 and the free cash flow in our guidance and discussed on our merger call is that the S-4 definition includes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisitions and excludes interest payments. We’re not providing 2021 GAAP guidance because given the inherent uncertainty around the merger. Management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of GAAP measures. And this slides to picks our adjusted guidance. While we expect that the merger will occur in the second half of this year, we’re providing adjusted guidance on a standalone basis. Revenue increasing mid single digits, corporate unallocated expense in the range of $140 million to $150 million, an increase over the $128 million in 2020, due to some expected normalization of pandemic related cost savings. Deal-related amortization of $95 million to $100 million, a decrease from the $123 million in 2020 at certain assets have been fully amortized. Operating profit margin in a range of 53.8% to 54.3%, which is 50 to 100 basis points higher than in 2020. Interest expense, net, which includes both interest income and interest expense in the range of $120 million to $125 million. This is lower than the $141 million in 2020 due to the recent refinancing of a large portion of our outstanding debt. Tax rates in the range of 21.5% 22.5%, which is consistent with the 21.5% reported in 2020. Diluted EPS in a range of $12.25 to $12.45, a 5% to 7% increase over 2020, while this growth rate might see modest, it is 29% to 31% higher than our 2019 EPS. That’s an average of about 15% per year, we just happened to achieve most of this increase in 2020. Also keep in mind that these figures assume no share purchases in 2021. And finally, free cash flow generation in a range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, which is flat to up $100 million compared to 2020 due to improved business performance, partially offset by normalizing cash collections, following a strong year with record low delinquencies in 2020. In addition to the slides that we have refute on this call, there’s an appendix with additional fourth quarter slides that can be downloaded from the investor presentation section of the investor relations website. In conclusion, 2020 was a very strong year for S&amp;P Global. Despite the recession, all of our businesses grew revenue and we improved our adjusted operating margin by 310 basis points. Year after year, we have demonstrated our ability to grow revenue and adjusted operating margin and we don’t believe that we are close to being done. We remain encouraged about our future and if just introduced 2021 adjusted guidance that reflects our optimism. Finally, I wanted to echo Doug’s comments about our employees. They continue to perform at an exceptional level in difficult circumstances and Doug, myself, and the rest of the leadership team applaud their tenacity and innovativeness. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions. Chip Merritt Thank you. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Chip Merritt Toni, you might be on mute. Operator Toni, your line is open. Toni Kaplan Announcement of buying IHS Markit, what’s been the reaction from your largest customers and from your internal business units. Is there anything in particular that they’re excited about or conversely concerned about that maybe you weren’t expecting initially? Doug Peterson Toni, hi. This is Doug. Let me take that. Well, first of all, thank you for joining the call today. And since we announced the merger with IHS Markit, it’s been great excitement from our customers. We have heard in particular from the financial institutions about all of the capabilities we’re going to be bringing together from the energy industry. We’ve also seen a lot of excitement from the people that are interested in ESG. Our employees are also very excited about that. We know each other. We had worked together before between our index business, their fixed income index business and our index business. People know each other there we’ve had great respect for Lance and for the team at IHS Markit. And so there’s excitement across the board and we see things are very positive. One final comment, as you saw in the slide, we talked about parallel paths. One of those is integration planning. So our teams have started to get to know each other through the integration work that we’re planning for. And again, there’s a lot of respect for each of the teams and a lot of progress being made there. Toni Kaplan Great. Wanted to ask about the market intelligence strategy going forward. Historically, you’ve been positioned as the lower price competitor relative to peers. And with all the assets that you’ve purchased over the years and with the eventual integration of IHS’s data. Does your strategy change going forward? Would you expect to be at a higher price level or should we expect your growth to be more driven by adding more customers? Or maybe it’s both, just how do we think about the strategy there? Thanks. Doug Peterson Yes. This is a really a little bit premature for me to be giving you the strategy. But if you think about what we’re going to be bringing together, market intelligence right now has a really strong base of installed customers, hundreds of thousands of users that are already using our information. So you think about that as one distribution channel for all of the very rich IHS Markit data. On the other hand, IHS Markit also has very powerful tools, which include workflow for financial institutions and for corporates and asset management industry, et cetera. So getting those two together is going to allow us to have a much more comprehensive strategy, both looking at the value that we bring, which you talk about is a price strategy. But I think of more as a value strategy that expands that. And then also ability to bring much more – many more products and services to all of the different kinds of customers that we serve. Toni Kaplan Thanks a lot. Doug Peterson Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may ask your question. Alex Kramm Hey, good morning. Just going through the base business for a minute here on the Ratings side. I think you made the comment, Doug, that the 3% issuance forecast, we should not take that as an indication of revenue. So can you just flesh out the other pieces we should be thinking about? I mean, clearly there’s going to be a much different mix this year. You obviously have some pricing opportunities. And then clearly, the recurring revenues have been running along very nicely. And maybe talk about the sustainability of those. So anything that can help us bridge that gap to how we should be thinking about revenue there. Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen Yes. Good morning, Alex. This is this is Ewout. As we have said many times about the Ratings business, it doesn’t always rain everywhere at the same time. So there are all these components that are growing up and several other components that are going down, but in aggregates, the outlook for Ratings looks always quite constructive. For 2021, overall from a revenue perspective, we expect low to mid single digit growth for Ratings, and that is particularly helped by non-transaction revenue. Non-transaction revenue, we’re currently estimating to grow at the mid to high single digit level in 2021, that is being held by higher surveillance fees based on more bonds outstanding based on the issuance levels last year, frequent issuer programs, Ratings Evaluation Services, which we expect to continue to be held by the M&amp;A environment. And then in terms of a mix, there’s always some elements that are going up and down. And then in addition to that, we should also see some benefits from new products. So overall, I think a very constructive outlook for Ratings and again, overall from a revenue perspective for the full year, low to mid single digit revenue growth. Alex Kramm Excellent, thank you. And then secondarily, Ewout, you made this comment briefly that in terms of share purchases, you could be doing something before the deal closes, if there was an open window. So maybe just flesh out what an open window means. And then related to that, what are your minimum cash requirements on a standalone and combined company. So we can dimensionalize that a little bit here. Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen Yes, Alex. We would love to do share buybacks but our certain regulatory limitations that we are facing this year. I think for example, about the current period, where the shareholders vote is underway. So we would not be able to do share buybacks until the shareholders meeting on March 11. Of course, we have also closed windows with respect to our quarterly results, and then we should not be in possession of material non-public information. So a combination of those elements might make the windows that we can do buybacks quite limited. And therefore we think it is likely we can do buybacks. But if there is an opportunity and from a legal perspective, we should be clear we definitely would like to restart some of the buybacks. Otherwise, we will do that post-close of the merger. There’s definitely going to be at that point in time, some catch up buybacks, because of course we’re falling short towards our return targets at this point in time. And then as we have stated at the merger call, in terms of our new financial targets, we’re expecting to return at least 85% of free cash flow going forward for the combined company and the combined company from a free cash flow perspective should have a very strong profile north of $4 billion out of the gate in terms of free cash flow and growing to about $5 billion or north of $5 billion in a few years’ time. From a balance sheet perspective, we will have a very robust balance sheet in the future with leverage ratio in a range of 2% to 2.5%, of course, we will have some minimum cash, but absolutely we are currently excess cash, surplus cash that we’ll return to shareholders once we have the opportunity to do so. Alex Kramm Fantastic. Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Thanks, Alex. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Ashish Sabadra Thanks for taking my question. So just on – as you’ve commenced your integration planning activities, obviously, you’ve given a pretty robust cost synergy targets as part of the merger. But are there areas that you’ve identified that could be potential incremental opportunities as you go through this integration planning? Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen At this moment, the expense synergies of $480 million is still our best estimate at this point in time. Please keep in mind, we’re still in a planning phase and both companies are run separately and independently. You know versus management, you know our management philosophy and approach will always look for further opportunities, but the $480 million of expense synergies is the number we are committed to right now. Ashish Sabadra That’s very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up to earlier question Toni asked. Just around the data as well as the Kensho’s data science. I was wondering how do you think about opportunities to further enhance the data leak that IHS Markit has the combining the data that S&amp;P has, but more importantly applying Kensho’s data science on top of it. Wondering, if you could share any incremental thoughts on that front. Doug Peterson Yes. Thank you, Ashish. And welcome to the call. I think this is the first time we’ve had you on the call. Well, first of all, this is one of the areas that we’ve got a lot of excitement about it. If you think about what is like to have the amount of data across both companies and you see the success we’ve had with Kensho the last few years. Today, we highlighted many of the new areas that they’ve been providing a great success. And we think about the data that IHS Markit brings, just as an example, there’s 50,000 customers in 140 countries, they’re serving 80% of the global Fortune 500, 94 of the largest companies in the U.S. And then on top of that, with the pricing data, the reference data, the private market solutions, the fixed income benchmarks and indices, and then all of that put together in a comprehensive data strategy with the data lake. That’s going to give us an ability to take the Kensho capabilities and develop all types of new products and services. If you think about that, though, in addition, IHS Markit also brings its own high-quality data sciences teams and across S&amp;P Global, we also have other high quality data sciences team. So this is one of the areas of the merger that we’re most excited about. And we’ve got teams that have already started looking at what some of those possibilities are. Ashish Sabadra Thanks, Doug. That was very helpful color. Doug Peterson Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. You may ask your question. Andrew Nicholas Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask maybe a bigger picture question, just wondering how you as a management team manage the different investment opportunities, growth initiatives, hiring plans for the standalone business with such a major merger expected to close later in the year. Are you a bit more hesitant to commit to multi-year projects, again, for the standalone business? Knowing that there could be hierarchy by opportunities that present themselves as a combined entity or do you just kind of keep your head down and run the existing business and address those opportunities when the time comes? I’m just curious any insight on how you plan and manage that during the waiting period would be helpful. Doug Peterson Andrew, this is Doug. I’m going to start and then hand it off to Ewout. When we’ve been – as you’ve seen earlier, we spent $139 million last year on a budget of $150 million of a target. And this year, we’ve targeted $100 million for our incremental growth expenses. We have a process around that. I’m going to hand that off to Ewout to talk more about that. But what’s important for us is that we are managing the company for the long run. We think that there are opportunities for us to continue to grow in the Ratings business and Platts, Market Intelligence and Indices very specifically with the capabilities that we have today, expanding into new markets, like we’ve mentioned Asia or China. New product capabilities or customer experience that we think are very important to continue with our differentiation that drives our growth. So we’re committed to all of those organic investments that we see internally and to keep driving those. But as I just mentioned, there’s also so many possibilities of bringing the two companies together. It’s too early for us to plan those. As Ewout mentioned, we’re two separate companies, we’re managed separately. But we can start dimensioning those and working together to identify what those could be. That’s one of the reasons we pulled back the investment from $150 million to $100 million this year, because we didn’t want to overextend people on areas that they might not be able to deliver once we start focusing on the integration. Ewout, do you want to talk a little bit more about our investment planning. Ewout Steenbergen Andrew, the way how we operate here is we have a committee – an investment committee that is built up by the business presidents and myself. And we’re looking at all the growth initiatives that are being put forward. These are initiatives that should drive revenue growth going forward and should have a minimum level of investments, because we don’t want to look at all the small investments. So these should be larger growth initiative for the company that you’ve helped with revenue growth in the future. And we make selections, which of those are the most interesting, where we would allocate our resources. It’s not only financial resources, more often, of course, product development resources, technology resources might be limiting factors there as well. And then ultimately, we allocate funding to those initiatives. And we are very encouraged about the growth of those initiatives. As Doug has mentioned during the prepared remarks, we have seen a lot of product launches in 2020, we’re seeing good traction of those initiatives. So we’re very encouraged at the level of innovation and new business development that we’re having within the company. And we’re continuing with that as well in 2021, please keep in mind that although the overall investment number is dropping, it doesn’t mean that those costs are going away. Because after two years, when an initiative is funded for a period of two years, it goes to a business as usual situation and those costs will become part of the normal business as usual bucket of the deficient. So it is not really a total expense drop, but the investments – the new investments in their first two years is going to be about $100 million in 2021. So still I think a very good number, a strong number, and all of these initiatives from our perspective, make sense independently of the merger, because they all are good initiatives that will help also the combined company in the future. Andrew Nicholas Great, thank you. That’s helpful. And then as my follow-up in the index business, I know you’re still six to nine months away from closing. But I am curious, if you have any initial thoughts on kind of the strategy or change in kind of distribution approach that might be required as you kind of focus on building out fixed income and multi-asset ETF products. Just trying to figure out how those businesses might differ from equity ETFs and that kind of ecosystem, if at all. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thank you. And there’s not a major change in the distribution strategy. Dan Draper, who joined us middle of the year, last year has put in place an excellent strategy to look across all of the different types of asset classes we want to be covering, which include multi-asset classes. Looking at what’s all of the major trends in the ETF markets, the mutual fund industry, as well as private investors and finding ways for us to bring the solutions that they need. As you can see from the growth in the markets, the growth is coming across many, many different types of asset classes, including fixed income and equities, global equities, commodities, real estate, et cetera. And so we want to be able to approach all of the different channels that we have with this broader set of capabilities and broader set of indices. And so it’s not going to be so much a change in distribution strategy. It’s a change in the capabilities and the breadth of the different kinds of products we’ll be able to provide. Andrew Nicholas Got it. Makes sense. Thanks a lot. Doug Peterson Thanks Andrew. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Jeff Silber Thanks so much. Ewout, you were kind enough earlier to give us a little bit of color on the revenue guidance for the Ratings segment. I was wondering if we can get similar comments on your other three segments. Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen Of course, Jeff. Mid single digit growth is the expectation for Market Intelligence and Platts, and then mid to high single digit revenue growth expectation for the index business and then on an enterprise basis mid single digits for this year. Jeff Silber All right. Great. Sounds like you were prepared to answer that question. I appreciate that. Moving back to your slide presentation, I think it was Slide 19, where you talked about the shift in global issuance among the different aspects. I’m just wondering, is there a meaningful impact either on your revenues or margins because of this shift? Thanks. Doug Peterson Let me take that one, Jeff. Well, first of all, as you know, there’s always a lot of shifts around the different kinds of issuance. And just a couple of examples in the fourth quarter, while the corporates were only up 2.7% and the U.S. financial institutions were up almost 27%. At the same time structured finance was down 27% globally. So you always see this kind of a mix in the aspects of the Ratings business, we see generally speaking fees based on the size of a transaction for a structured finance based on the complexity and size of structured loans of, if you look at leveraged transactions, high yield bonds, et cetera. Generally speaking, we do get higher fees from those types of asset classes. Jeff Silber Okay, great. That’s really helpful. Thanks so much. Doug Peterson Thanks, Jeff. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. You may ask your question. Owen Lau Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Doug, you mentioned that there have been some high profile default in China, and there’s an increased sensitivity in the quality of local rating. Could you please talk about your recent conversation with China on this topic? Is any short-term solution and does it accelerate the timeline for China to open up its capital markets? Thank you. Doug Peterson As you know, we’ve been encouraged to China bond market continues to develop. This is something that despite me saying that there have been some defaults. It’s not that I’m encouraged about to default, but what you see now as the regulators are really starting to pay attention to the quality of the Ratings in the markets, as well as the market participants. We have seen recently that the regulators have started to put in place some new discussions around eliminating AA floor for the insurance industry. They’re also looking at seeing if they’re going to have a new approach to regulating the Ratings industry. So there’s also been some interest among specific market participants at a recent report. We put out which showed what the spread would be of a different bonds that you compare them to a rating scales. So we’re very encouraged at the Chinese bond market. It continues to develop the regulators are focused on it, and most importantly, investors themselves are looking at seeing how they can drive a much higher quality credit ratings industry. Owen Lau Got it. That’s very helpful. And then in terms of your blockchain initiatives, I think, Doug, you also mentioned Distro previously for the renewable energy. Could you please give us an update on that project? And then also, I remember like two or three years ago, you also mentioned a project at the Port of Fujairah. Could you please also give us an update as well? Thank you. Doug Peterson Yes. W we think that blockchain is one of the areas that will continue to develop and financial markets from the point of view of contracts, specialized contracts, the ability to gather data in a way that becomes reliable and it becomes unchangeable. And so the place that we’ve been working on this in the company is through Platts. The first application was in the Fujairah Port, where now all of the participants in that major port provide all of their data through a blockchain application that goes to the regulators. And then we have access to that to be able to use it for pricing, for references as well as for news. And then we recently worked on the Distro project, which allows us to also get that same kind of information in another market as we advance this, it’s something that we’re learning across the company. We think blockchain will be an area that with IHS Markit, we can advance our work. And we’re very pleased that we were able to have some initial wins in especially with Fujairah and then in Rotterdam. Owen Lau Got it. Thank you very much. Doug Peterson Thank you, Owen. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. You may ask your question. Craig Huber Great, thank you. Two questions. Maybe I’ll start with Ewout or Doug, maybe talk about this merger of the playbook or the similarities you guys are going to put in place here. I’m trying to think about this versus where your company was at versus say three, four, five years ago, when all the changes you guys put in place to raise margins, increase the efficiency at S&amp;P legacy and what you learn there. And you plan on applying on that side of the business over IHS going forward. You talk – touch on that briefly pleased the playbook. Doug Peterson Yes. So Craig, let me start. This is something that we’ve thought a lot about. And when we were working on this idea with our management team and our Board of Directors, one of the most important questions that I asked and we had good discussion with the Board is do we have the capacity to undertake a transaction like this and that includes our management capacity, our people, our team, our technology, what are the lessons learned we’ve had, do we have in particular, the ability to undertake an integration like this. And one of the other questions that we asked is, and what kind of talent will IHS Markit bring as well. And as we did our due diligence and we already knew the team, but as we got to know them better, we were impressed that they were also going to bring a really high quality management team that would be complimentary to ours and that together we could actually undertake something like this. But one thing that we’ve done over the past five years is we put in place a very disciplined approach to managing the company. And it starts with an annual plan that we look at with the Board of Directors. We agree on, it then leads to goals and objectives, which feed into our own performance, individual performance goals, as well as our divisional and functional performance goals. Those include areas that our customer operations people. So it’s not only driven by financial performance. We also include operational targets, which includes risk management targets. So we put in place a management system, which we think will be work very well with the IHS Markit team. And if we wouldn’t have had the confidence that we had that, that process in place now for many years that we’d been delivering and that we had the capacity to do something like this and along with the quality of the teams coming along, we would not have undertaken something like this. Craig Huber And then my follow-on question is more of a nitpick here. The non-transaction line within ratings, you touched on this brief with that obviously is up 15% or so year-over-year. It was also up 15% coincidentally versus the average of the first three quarters as you know. You talk about guidance for this New Year, I think about mid-to-high single digits for non-transactional ratings for the New Year, which is higher than generally runs that. But if you just annualize that 451 yet for non-transactional ratings and you apply that for all of next year on a year-over-year basis, that would be up at that 11%. So clearly there must be something sort of one-time in nature that benefits you guys in non-transactional ratings in 4Q. If you could just touch on that, I just want to understand that great increase you had there. Thank you. Doug Peterson Hey Craig, that’s a great observation. 15% is the non-transaction reported revenue growth. 11% is to organic non-transaction revenue growth. The difference of the 4% is driven mostly by CRISIL and CRISIL’s acquisition of Greenwich Associates. Greenwich Associates has a certain pattern in terms of recognizing revenues and expenses that is mostly in the fourth quarter of every year, given their level of activity. So that’s why that difference between organic and report at non-transaction also bates larger than normally you would see in a particular quarter, but that’s what’s driven by that particular acquisition. Therefore 11% is more what you should look at from an ongoing basis organically. And then we set those one-third is coming from the – revenues coming from non-transaction revenues from surveillance and another one-third from a rating evaluation surfaces that we also expected to be strong in 2021. So therefore to mid-to-high single digit growth outlook for non-transaction this year. Craig Huber Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, Craig. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. You may ask your question. Hamzah Mazari Good morning. Thank you. My first question is just on Market Intelligence margins. Could you Ewout talk about how you’re thinking about margins here? Is this sort of a cross margin and we bear it from here? Just given some of the investment spend and just given your longer-term target for this segment being I guess mid-to-high 30s. Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Hamzah. If you look at the Market Intelligence margins for 2020, they were for the full year up 30 basis points and what you see is underlying growth from operations and the normal operating leverage that the business is having. But then the offsets were some of the acquisitions that were margin dilutive, for example, the 451 Research acquisition, as well as the investment spent. The investment spend should translate in 2021 to additional revenue growth. So we should start to see the benefits of those investments spend in 2021 and also overall the investment spend for Market Intelligence will come down a bit. So overall we should expect that operating leverage will be stronger, and therefore also the margin expansion will be stronger for Market Intelligence in 2021. So what we overall expect is Market Intelligence margins to see quite a nice increase during this year. Hamzah Mazari Great. And then just a question on the deal, is it fair to say that don’t expect any new information until the deal closes around sort of synergies, revenue synergies, cost synergies, cash integration costs or do you expect to sort of release information as you’re going through this pre-planning phase? Ewout Steenbergen Hamzah, of course, we are going through the planning phase, a lot of work is underway, more work to be done up to the point that we will close. At this moment, this is the information that we can provide to you as you know the S-4 is now effective and would expect some updates closure to the close of the merger itself or post the merger itself. So we are not really planning to give any changes in updates between now and the close. Hamzah Mazari Got it. Thank you so much. Doug Peterson Thanks, Hamzah. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. You may ask your question. Simon Clinch Hi everyone, thanks for taking my question. I was wondered if I could just going back to the fantastic sort of innovations products that you outlined from your Kensho capabilities. Could you just talk about how those kinds of new innovations feed through to actual incremental revenue opportunities for your over time in terms of the sort of process of distributing them to customers and when you actually start monetizing them. And then are these the kinds of things that are built into your expectations for revenue synergies in part for the IHS merger as well? Doug Peterson Yes. First of all, let me mention that when we talked earlier about some of the growth that we’ve seen in the Kensho indices where we grew 10 times in the spider Kensho indices new economy indices. That’s something that directly drives revenue. We have other areas where something like our OmniSearch, which is a ability to have an intuitive search tool on a Market Intelligence platform. That’s something that drives traffic and it drives retention. It gives you a superior ability to gather data from the markets until link it. And so that again is something that drives a retention. And another example would be something like we talked before about being able to ingest $11 million new company data from groups like Preqin into our private capital information and something like that drives the ability for us to have unique data faster than any other organization. Another example of that would be something like market on close in Platts, where we started off with one pilot, now we’re up to 80 different commodities that are using a new process. It gets our information in the market 80% faster. So we think that all of these whether it’s efficiency, it’s data linking its actual products themselves that are being delivered by Kensho all of those at the end of the day, help drive customer experience or directly drive revenue. Ewout Steenbergen And Simon, if I may build on Doug’s answer, the revenue benefits from Kensho you see now within the division. So it’s all recognized within the divisions. I think over time, you would see more also external revenue coming from Kensho again, some of Kensho capabilities are now offered on the marketplace or sold directly to certain customers. So that’s a benefit that will come in. So Kensho was pivoted more internally for the first period, but we see a little bit of change more pivot to an external focus, again over the next periods. And then to the last part of your question, what could this do for the merger. At this moment in terms of the merger synergies, we had not contemplated any benefits from Kensho. So we’re actually also excited to see what Kensho can do, and I cannot wait to see if we can unleash Kensho, and we have had some first planning meetings around that as well. So Kensho is definitely going to be a very interesting element to the merger and some of the upsides of the merger going forward. Simon Clinch That’s really useful. Thanks very much. And I guess my follow-up question tend to the ESG business. And I guess what I’m thinking about is obviously the evolution of your business particularly with the RobecoSAM survey asset that you have involving that over time to become something more nimble and more flexible as opposed to just an annual survey and how you might be able to use that to really service and leverage that in terms of servicing the corporate clients for various needs over time perhaps you could talk about that opportunity. Doug Peterson Yes. This ESG is definitely one of the most exciting areas for us at the company. As you saw, we had $65 million of revenues last year, which had been growing at a 40% pace. And when you bring the capabilities of IHS Markit together, we’re going to have scores and time series, workflow platforms. We’re going to bring emissions data from IHS Markit. IHS Markit also has the fixed income indices, and they’ve got information about plastics and other sorts of model of metals that are used in batteries. So bringing these together are going to be something that are really new for us. And let me give you a couple examples, just imagine if you were a Chief Sustainability Officer, you mentioned the corporate clients, corporate clients are increasingly either through their treasure or directly as sustainability officer looking at how their own company is going to perform and what is their own individual approach to running their sustainability programs. We’re going to have the tools to provide them a rating. We’re going to build them. They’re going to have the CSA. We’re going to have the ability to provide them with more data to have benchmark against other third-parties. And then when you think about IHS Markit, ESG reporting repository, the carbon data that they bring that it will allow them to have the workflow tools. We think that this is one of the areas that will actually allow us on our own. And then together with the IHS Markit would be really building a very relevant, very powerful ESG model. One thing I would end with is that we just launched a new ESG website. I would recommend that everybody go look at it. You can immediately look for ESG scores of companies on it, and then it has tiles of all of the different capabilities that we have. And so this is something for us. You’re going to see a lot of investment here, a lot of focus on ESG. It’s one of the most exciting growth areas in the company. Simon Clinch Great. Thanks so much. Doug Peterson Thanks, Simon. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. George Tong Hi, thanks. Good morning. You expect global debt issuance to be up 3% in 2021. Can you elaborate on how you expect individual debt categories to perform including investment grade high yield loans and structured? Doug Peterson Sure. George, this is Doug. I’m not quite sure if I can give you all of those categories, but what we’ve looked at in 2020 is, as I mentioned earlier, it’s about a 2.7% or let’s say a little bit close to 3% decrease for the year. But that includes financial services that we think will be up 3.5% structured finance up 2.5% offset by corporates, which will be down a little bit over 8% and U.S. public finance down about 5%. We do see a lot of demand coming from the M&amp;A area. We think that between SPACs and what we see there, the activity from SPACs and other general M&amp;A that pipeline is growing. And typically a lot of that is more in the high yield area, but in terms of high yield versus other types, I don’t really have anything further on that, but we do see that this year there should be a very different mix than we’ve seen in prior years. George Tong Got it. That’s helpful. And Doug, it’s been two months since you announced the merger with IHS Markit. What additional findings have you had on the strategic opportunity during the course of due diligence? Would you like to call out? Doug Peterson Well, there’s a couple I would call out that are maybe beyond what we’d originally thought. One of them is what I call private assets or being able to support the private equity industry. When we originally looked at this, we started looking at areas that were maybe a little bit more obvious in financial institutions and what we could do for debt capital markets for corporate treasures. One of the areas that I see a lot of upside is in what we call private markets, private equity, think about how much longer assets are staying private before they go public or the information that people would like to look at for their supply chain. And when you put the two companies together, you have tools that at IHS Markit, which for valuation IVAL and QVAL, they’ve got portfolio monitoring tools, high level. As you heard, we talk about earlier, we’ve been ingesting data from people like Preqin into our tools. And then we’ve got the information from 451 Research from money market directories, our Market Intelligence platform. And you put all these together and it’s going to be a very complete set of services of workflow tools, valuation tools, reference data, fundamental data about corporations that we wouldn’t have been able to do alone. And so that’s one of the areas that I was quite excited about. I also mentioned what we’ll be able to do with ESG that’s another area that’s the upside, I think there is higher than what I originally would have thought. And then finally, when we look at energy transition, which I – sometimes I think of energy transition as part of ESG, but for climate change and the interests that this is generating, it’s not always directly the same thing as ESG. This is another area that between what we’ve got in Market Intelligence and Ratings, but add that in with what we have between Platts and the resources business at IHS Markit. There’s going to be a lot of opportunities in new energy, new energy investments all of the things that are involved in EV, which also will bring some of the capacities from the transportation business at IHS Markit. So on energy transition, I think this is also another area that is well beyond what I probably originally contemplated. George Tong Very helpful. Thank you. Doug Peterson Thanks, George. Operator We will now take our final questions from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may ask your question. Manav Patnaik Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here, guys. Just to follow-up on the ESG, I apologize if I missed this earlier, but the $65 million in revenue for the year, how do you break that down between your research and data and perhaps in the indices and just some thoughts on the growth rates and the potential mix changes you anticipate as that portfolio evolves. Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Manav. If you look at the $65 million, which is 47% over 2019, we’re not really breaking it out for each of the divisions and initiatives, but directionally, how you should look at it is the Platts energy transition initiatives are a significant part of the revenues today. But what we are seeing is particularly high growth or new initiative the ESG scores, green evaluations, ESG indices fees. So particularly all the new initiatives are growing very fast and all of that together is driving this revenue growth up going forward. And Doug has given you some of the statistics and data, for example, underneath some of the ETF AUMs that are using our ESG indices. So overall I think it’s really across the board, but at the current macro level, I think Platts is a significant component of the overall revenues. Manav Patnaik Got it. That’s helpful. And then I guess just staying on track mid-single digit growth, I guess estimated for 2021, Platts has historically always been pretty resilient to what happens in the energy markets, but the IHS asset has been much more sensitive. I was just curious how you guys look at 2021 and perhaps even beyond in terms of how that energy market fits into your strategy. Ewout Steenbergen Yes, we are very encouraged about the opportunities to bring the resources business of IHS Markit and Platts together. I think it’s very complimentary. I think that will be a very large benefit for our customers with Platts having particularly a focus on price reporting as you know, and that is quite steady and stable. The resources business of IHS Markit that is going through a transition from more upstream to more downstream. The upstream business has seen some headwinds and might continue for a shorter period of time, but particularly downstream analytics is doing very well. So the opportunities to bring that together and to look at the commercial opportunities for the combined company is actually very attractive. Think about what we can do with respect to metals and mining, think about what we can do with respect to the analytics platforms, bringing that together for our customers, think about what we can do with the Data Lake and Platts analytics roles by unlocking the value of the data of IHS Markit resources. So we’re actually very encouraged and we think despite some of the changes, structural changes in the industry, that we can help our customers particularly also with energy transition. Manav Patnaik All right. Thanks a lot. Doug Peterson Thanks, Manav. Thank you very much. I’d like to just provide a couple of closing comments. I want to thank everybody for joining our call this morning and for all your questions and your support as always. As you saw 2020 was a very strong year for us during difficult circumstances. We made a lot of significant progress along the way with areas that we’d been in investing in over the last few years. As you know we had put in place investment programs and we started seeing them pay off as we called it the year of the product launch. And it has to do with our technology, our innovation, productivity programs that we put in place. We’re very proud about what we’re doing in China and the progress and advances that we’re making there. Our ESG program is starting to really take off and we think we’re very well-positioned. And then our own internal environmental performance and social outreach and our own ESG approach, we think is something that’s very important for our company. And of course, what is really most important for us this year is to continue to stay focused on the IHS Markit merger. We’re so excited about that. We’re always impressed with the people we meet with the capabilities, with the products, with the reach that they have and we think that that’s going to allow us to have a very strong opportunity in 2021 and beyond. And as I’ve said all along during last year and before we could’ve never made this progress without our people and the talented people that we have that are working very hard especially in 2020 during uncertain and difficult circumstances. I want to thank all of our people again. Everyone’s done a fantastic job. So thank you, everyone for joining us again today. And we look forward to continuing to talk to you throughout the year.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Boyer Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 2020 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q4 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, whole or in part, without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit’s filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Jonathan Gear, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions. With that, it’s my pleasure the call to -- turn the call over to Lance. Unidentified Company Representative Lance, you’re on mute. Lance Uggla Oh, sorry. There we go. The first mute of the year. There we go. If everybody can go mute on the teams, there we go. Okay. So I will start fresh. Thank you, Eric, and happy New Year and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 earnings call. We achieved a lot in 2020, solid financial results proving the resiliency of our business model; greater levels of innovation across the company; higher employee satisfaction scores; and finally, we announced a strategic merger with S&amp;P Global, which will create the leading global information services provider. Overall, we finished the year ahead of expectations and are reiterating our 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are updating our adjusted EPS by $0.03 due to our share repurchase restriction because of the pending merger. Now onto the financial highlights for the quarter and the year. When we speak to Q4 and fiscal year results, they are normalized to exclude the impact of the aerospace and defense divestiture and the cancellation of Q2 events on growth rates for organic revenue and adjusted EPS. Organic revenue growth was 0% for the quarter and the year, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion was 160 basis points in the quarter and 250 basis points for the year, and adjusted EPS growth was 11% in the quarter and 13% for the year. In terms of our core industry verticals, I'll provide Q4 and full-year 2020 highlights and our outlook for 2021. First, our Financial Services segment had organic revenue growth of 6% in Q4 and 5% for the full-year. In 2020, within information, we continue to benefit from the innovation and demand for our pricing, reference data and valuations offerings. The successful launch of new regulatory solutions, notably our SFTR reporting platform, and we had strong growth from indices led by our fixed income and newly launched ESG indices. Within Solutions, we continue to invest in our leading products and integration capabilities, launched private debt investment lifecycle solution and experienced robust growth from continued expansion of our managed corporate action solutions. Within Processing, we invested in our core OTC and loan settlement platforms to help the industry facilitate the IBOR transition and regulatory requirements. We also successfully service the industry through one of the most volatile periods in recent history. In 2021, we expect organic growth within financial services in the 6% to 8% range. Within information, growth will be led by increasing customer demand and new products within our pricing, reference data and valuation services businesses. We also expect continued strength for our regulatory reporting and compliance offerings. Within this business, we'll integrate our recent acquisition of Cappitech, which will help solidify our leading industry position. Now within Solutions, we expect high growth across our diversified offerings, and a rebound in managed services and implementation of projects. In particular, we are looking for a strong year from our onboarding and compliance management tools, expansion of our portfolio and data management solutions into new sectors and continued high growth in private market offerings. We also expect normalized levels of equity and debt issuance that will drive solid performance in our syndication and book building businesses. Processing is expected to be slightly up year-over-year with mixed market conditions in both loans and derivative markets. Now let's move on to transportation, with organic revenue growth in the quarter of 2% and a decline of 2% for the year. In 2020, the pandemic had a major impact on the automotive industry. And we responded proactively to the crisis by working with our customers and continue to see the rebound in our business with recurring organic growth of 6% in Q4. During the pandemic, we also increased our focus on driving adoption of newer products, such as CARFAX for Life, while accelerating product innovation across our portfolios in areas such as marketing audiences, enhanced compliance simulation and Mastermind now available for used cars. Our Maritime &amp; Trade business had a solid year, excluding the impact of the cancellation of our TPM conference. In 2021, we expect organic growth within transportation in the 12% to 15% range. We expect our automotive business to revert to its longer-term growth range. Although economic uncertainty remains, our dealer-facing businesses have strong momentum going into 2021, and the strong retention rates we've maintained through 2020 attest to the critical nature of our products. Product support in our OEM and supplier customers will recover more gradually as the industry adjusts to lower long-term volumes coming out of COVID. In addition to the underlying growth in the business, we expect to see a one-time pickup in organic growth from pricing being at normal levels for the full-year, specifically within CARFAX and Mastermind businesses. And final -- finally, Maritime &amp; Trade will continue to see accelerating subscription growth, driven by product innovation in our risk and compliance and commodities analytics businesses. Moving on to resources, where organic decline was 11% in the quarter and negative 5% for the full-year. In 2020, our upstream business was impacted by the industry undergoing severe CapEx reductions, leading to cost pressure within our customer base and bankruptcies, particularly in North America. Our downstream organic revenue growth proved resilient, when normalizing for our events. Growth within our gas, power and renewables businesses were driven by customer expansion into areas such as wind, battery, solar, and hydrogen services. This was somewhat offset by lower non-recurring revenue within consulting. We also completed the integration of the agribusiness and acquired truView, a small upstream analytics company. And in 2021, we expect organic revenue results within resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low single digits. Our downstream businesses are expected to return to mid-single-digit organic growth, driven by continued demand for our pricing, chemical information, the release of additional plastic circularity products, a new database of estimated energy chain emissions and from the realization of synergies from the agribusiness integrations. Within our upstream businesses, we expect customer CapEx spend to continue to be constrained for our annual contract value, which will bottom in Q1. In 2021, we excite -- are excited to launch our new predictive analytics tools that will marry our upstream and midstream global data sets with our proprietary insights and research and will drive additional forward growth. Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was 0% for the quarter, and 1% normalized for the impact of BPVC for the full year. Product design proved its resilience with organic growth in the low single digits, normalized for BPVC, while TMT and ECR performed as expected. In 2021, we expect our organic revenue growth to be in the mid single digits. Moving on to some of our recently announced strategic initiatives. We entered into a 50-50 joint venture with shared control with CME to combine our post trade services, including trade processing and risk mitigation operations. The venture is going to incorporate our MarkitSERV business and CME's optimization business. Through the combination, we will achieve increased operating efficiencies and new revenue opportunities by being able to better service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rates, FX, equity and credit asset classes. We expect the deal to close in the summer and to be neutral to our adjusted earnings in the near-term. And finally, we announced the strategic merger with S&amp;P Global, which joins two world class organizations with unique highly complementary assets. This combination creates a pro forma company with increased scale world class products in core markets and strong joint offerings in the high growth adjacencies, including ESG and energy transition, private assets and small and medium enterprises, counterparty risk management, supply chain and trade and alternative data are unique and complementary assets will leverage cutting edge innovation and technology capability including the IHS Markit Data Lake, and S&amp;P Global's Kensho to enhance the customer value proposition. For IHS Markit shareholders, employees and customers, merging with S&amp;P Global was the best strategic fit to create the most long-term value. Post the merger announcement, Doug Peterson, CEO of S&amp;P Global announced his executive team for the pro forma company, which includes the following members of my Executive team. First, Adam Kansler will lead the combined S&amp;P Global market intelligence business and the IHS Markit Financial Services segment. Edouard Tavernier will lead the Transportation segment. Sari Granat will be the combined company's Chief Admin Officer and General Counsel; and Sally Moore will lead Strategic Alliances and will have responsibility for Corporate Development and Strategy. Other members of my Executive team and myself have also agreed to help with the integration for 12 to 18 months post the close. I believe Doug has assembled a great executive team that will bring together members of both companies, including -- and then give the leadership and -- sorry, Doug has assembled a great executive team that will bring together members of both companies leadership, and will be a great first step in merging the two companies. And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan. Jonathan Gear Great. Thank you, Lance. We have a strong finish to the year with results ahead of our expectations. Our Q4 financial performance included revenue of $1.107 billion, with organic growth of 0% and all-in revenue of negative 1%, GAAP net income of $151 million and GAAP EPS of $0.38; adjusted EBITDA of $465 million, an increase a 3% with margins of 42.0% and adjusted EPS was $0.72, an increase of $0.07 or 11%. We were pleased with the finish of the year, and a solid revenue and profit performance we delivered throughout 2020. Relative to revenue, our Q4 organic revenue growth of 0% included recurring organic growth of 2% and nonrecurring organic growth of negative 11%. Moving to segment performance, Financial Services revenue growth was 7%, including 6% organic and 1% FX. Recurring organic was 6%, while nonrecurring organic growth was 9%. Our information business organic was 4% led by strength in our pricing indices and equities information products. Our processing organic was 1% as we saw a return to growth in loan markets offset by a slight decline in derivatives processing. Solutions organic was 10% due primarily to strong performance in our corporate actions, private markets and digital businesses. Transportation had revenue decline of negative 4% including 2% organic, flat FX and divestiture of negative 6%. Organic growth was comprised of 6% recurring and negative 9% nonrecurring. Resources revenue declined 11%, including negative 11% organic and flat FX. Recurring organic was negative 8% and nonrecurring organic was negative 32%. Our Q4 ACV decreased $22 million and our full-year ACV decreased $74 million, down 9% versus prior year. We ended the year with ACV of $719 million, which now include agri of approximately $30 million. CMS revenue declined 2%, including 0%, our benchmarking business divestiture impact of negative 1% and flat FX, recurring organic was 2% and nonrecurring organic growth was negative 13%. Turning now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA was $465 million, up 3%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.0%, up 160 basis points. Moving to segment profitability, Financial Services adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.7%, up 260 basis points; Transportations margin was 45.3%, up 350 basis points; Resources margin was 40.2%, down 200 basis points and CMS margin was 24.7%, up 20 basis points. GAAP net income was $151 million or $0.38 per share. Our adjusted EPS was $0.72 per diluted share, a $0.07 or 11% improvement over the prior year. Our full-year adjusted tax rate was 18%.Q4 free cash flow was $275 million. Our full year free cash flow was $940 million and represented a conversion rate of 51%. As a reminder, our full year conversion rate was impacted by several nonrecurring items. Turning to the balance sheet, our year-end debt balance was $4.9 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x on a bank covenant basis, and we closed the quarter with $126 million of cash. At year end, our undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.2 billion. Our Q4 fully diluted weighted average share count was 400.5 million shares, and our full year was 401.5 million shares. We completed the 200 million ASR in November of 2020. Our full-year share repurchases were approximately $1.1 billion or 14.6 million shares at an average price of $73.71. The merger agreement with S&amp;P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares, and therefore our share repurchase program is currently suspended. Other than for the purchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share-based compensation. We paid a dividend of $67 million in Q4 for an FY 2020 total of $270 million of dividends. The merger agreement allows for the continued paying of a regular quarterly cash dividend in the future. And we are recommending to our Board for the approval in our January 2021 meeting to increase a quarterly dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.20 per share, effective for the Q1 2021 dividend payment. Moving to full year of financial results. When we speak to full-year results they are normalized to exclude the impact of the aerospace and defense divestiture, and the cancellation of Q2 events on growth raised for organic revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Total full-year revenue was $4.288 billion, which represent a decline of negative 3%, 0% organic, negative 2%, [technical difficulty] flat FX. Turning now to reported profits, adjusted EBITDA was $1.837 billion, up 8% versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.8% with reported margin expansion of 250 basis points. GAAP net income was $871 million with GAAP EPS of $2.17, and adjusted EPS was $2.84, a 13% increase versus prior year. In terms of guidance, we are reiterating our 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, and updating our adjusted EPS for a $0.03 impact due to our inability to repurchase shares as a result of the pending merger. Our 2021 guidance is as follows. Revenue of $4.535 billion to $4.635 billion, with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, including recurring organic growth of 6% to 7%. Adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.03 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points, and adjusted EPS of $3.11 to $3.16 per year. Finally, we do expect cash conversion in the mid 60s as we lap our 2020 one-time cash impacts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance. Lance Uggla Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. We managed through the many challenges of 2020 very well and are positioned to have a strong 2021. We're excited about the merger with S&amp;P Global, and believe it will create long-term value for shareholders, new insights and capabilities for customers and greater opportunities for employees. Finally, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support and our colleagues around the world for their dedication and focus through what was a very challenging 2020. Operator, we're ready to open the lines for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kevin McVeigh Great. Thanks so much. Hey, pardon me, congratulations. Lance or Jonathan, what do you think about kind of the joint venture you announced with CME seems really interesting. Is there more opportunity, just given the unique data sets to cultivate beyond CME into other opportunities? And just, I think, it underscores the strategic rationale for the S&amp;P deal. Is there more opportunity from a client perspective, any initial reactions around the announced acquisition and then just additional opportunities that you're seeing similar to kind of what you do with CME? Lance Uggla Okay. Why don't I start, then I'll pass it to Adam, who did the transaction for us. But this was something that when we originally thought about selling MarkitSERV, we actually thought that there would be a impetus to buyers that wanted to find ways to consolidate the assets. But I think given that the assets are primarily held by strategics and consortia and a variety of industry-owned relationships, it -- I think, it proved a tall order for any private equity firm to create that consolidation. And so post that, we looked at the strategic assets across the industry. And, of course, between ourselves and CME, we have the majority of the OTC processing assets. And so, therefore, the synergies for both on the cost side, but also in terms of the servicing the customer and creating incremental margin for investment stood out really strong. And we think that the consolidation of processing assets across the industry is something that this -- the CME IHS Markit transaction as a JV is a first step. But why don’t I pass it over to Adam, who can give you some incremental color. Adam? Adam Kansler Sure. Thanks, Lance. There will be much more to come over the next few months as we bring the two businesses together. But as a sort of as a high level answer to your question, you have a very common set of customers, common set of workflows and a lot of the same data enriching the workflows that the customers use on multiple platforms across the CME assets and ours. So this opportunity to bring it together, you'll have a much more complete dataset across all of those workflows, certainly within the derivatives markets, giving you the opportunity to build additional analytical tools, workflow tools, and things that allow our customers to manage their risk and processes more efficiently. I think they've -- the customer set has found for many years that maintain these data sets and these workflows in multiple places is highly inefficient, it's expensive and it causes breaks in some circumstances. So this is an opportunity to improve the risk management profile for our customer set, bring efficiency, bring their costs down and bring a better set of tools. So there will certainly be innovation and new applications and tools against those data sets and in bringing those workflows together over time. Lance Uggla Thanks, Adam. Next question. Kevin McVeigh Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open. Manav Patnaik Yes. Good morning, guys. I just want to focus on the resources business. So if I got the ACV right, if you exclude the agri business, it is down 9% and that's decelerated again for the third quarter in a row. So I was just curious why you’re confident that things going to bottom in Q1 here? Lance Uggla Jonathan, do you want to start and then pass that to Brian or vice versa? Jonathan Gear Sure. I'll go ahead and start and then pass on to Brian Crotty. Manav, so we've – the resources really is playing out as we expect it back in Q2 of this year when we saw the impact coming in on upstream. And we're seeing a two-tier world, obviously, where upstream business challenged by the external markets and the downstream business performing pretty much in line on the subscription side. The -- with the ACV as we kind of we need to lap a full 12 months from the restructuring of the marketplace, which took place in kind of mid-Q2. As we know and as we've discussed on previous calls, we've kind of leaned into this pretty heavily, worked closely with our customers and industry customers around us, but it does take a full 12 months. So as we look forward, we -- Q4 performed as we expected. We expect further decline of Q1, but Q1 for ACV being – bottoming out and then building in Q2. But I'll pass over to Brian for any specific color that he's seeing. Brian, I don't think we can -- I don't think we can hear, Brian. I think you're … Brian Crotty Oh, okay. Sorry. Yes, I said, Jonathan, you're exactly right. When I look at the ACVs, it's really upstream that drove the decline in ACV. When you look out at the next year, you can see … Lance Uggla You’re going to mute the other one, Brian. Use the other call. All right, thank you. Brian Crotty Can you hear me now? I’m sorry. Lance Uggla Yes. Brian Crotty Okay. Yes, when you look at the ACVs on the rest of the group, you can see them improving steadily. And even upstream, we hit bottom in Q1 and then we steadily improve and get positive ACV in Q2, Q3 and Q4. Lance Uggla Right. Thanks. Thanks, Brian and Jonathan. Now next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Gary Bisbee Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe I'll stick with resources. One of the key questions I get from people around the S&amp;P transaction is just thinking through potential synergies. And with resources it's not so clear to me and I think the other is exactly where those will be. Since you acquired Opus a couple years ago, which is a similar business model to a lot of Platts. Can you just help us understand what synergies adding Opus to your portfolio has done -- delivered for the resources business? Has it help innovation? Has it help create new data sets? Have there been some real clear benefits to business and especially the top line from adding that to your portfolio over the last couple of years? Thank you. Lance Uggla Maybe I can start, Brian, and then I'll hand it to you. So first off, if you look at our business, it's a 50% upstream, consulting data analytics. And, of course, that business is different than the S&amp;P global business. And so there aren't the numerous product synergies, but there's definitely scale with customers and new customer opportunities for opportunity. As you shift down through chemicals, agriculture, Opus, all the pricing, McCloskey Coal indices, as you get into the pricing and indices, of course, all of those services, where we have synergies between them, have the same opportunity set with the Platts teams. So we're quite excited about the mid and downstream synergies around the pricing and new services, ex where there's overlap and we'll have to address that within the closing of the merger. But that's a small piece of the revenue. Brian, do you want to add to that? Brian Crotty Yes. I think for us, it gives us a whole new customer base as well. When you look at wholesalers, convenience store marketers, even penetrates us more into traders. So I think that was a good thing for the Opus acquisition. Also, pricing services tend to have stickier renewal rates. And then the strong news component gives us a lower end product to up-sell higher end services. So I think strategically it was a very good acquisition. Gary Bisbee Thank you. Lance Uggla Hey, thanks. Thanks, Brian. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff Meuler Yes, thank you. On the transportation outlook, is it the typical annual pricing increase in CARFAX and AMM? Or is there some catch up since I don't think you got your typical increase this year? And what's the timing of that? And then any comment on kind of forward visibility on nonrecurring within transportation. I know that, like the timing of recall campaigns can impact that, but just as we think about getting back to the growth that you're projecting? Thanks. Lance Uggla Okay. Edouard, do you want to pick that one? Edouard Tavernier Yes, happy to pick it up. Thank you, Jeff, for the question. So on the pricing side, there will be price increases in 2021, and we will proceed carefully. Let's remember that across North America, we're still in the middle of the pandemic. So we are still reflected on exactly the right time to introduce a price increase. So that currently is planned, but it will be a normal pricing increase and no particular catch ups. We are very focused on the health of our customers and dealer partners. In terms of the forward visibility, as you mentioned, Jeff, a lot of our transactional revenues are tied to things like marketing spend by the industry, as well as activity in the recall business. Now we're seeing some of those spend items come back, they were higher in Q4 than in Q3, and we're seeing a lot of good marketing activity coming through in Q1. So we are confident, they are on their way back. But as Lance mentioned in the introductory comments, and it will take a bit longer for them to reverse to normalized trends. We expect that in the second half of the next year. Jeff Meuler Thank you. Lance Uggla Thanks, Edouard. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm Yes, hey. Just a quick one on the guidance. I know, largely unchanged, but the margin upside pretty consistent with prior years. Any things to point out there on a segment basis or on a seasonal basis that we should be aware of as we think about 2021, or pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past? Lance Uggla Okay. Sure, Alex. Yes, we'll do, Alex. Thanks for the question. In terms of the 100 basis points margin performance, again, that's really just building, as you know and in last fiscal year, a very usual fiscal year for us many, many ways. But we did make some structural changes in our costs, and we're seeing a flow through there. That's less than normal growth rates that we're seeing on the 6% to 8% total that helps drive that overall margin. I think you will see particular as we flow through -- I would look at FY '21 as a relatively normal year. The comparison to '20 is where it gets a bit harry at times from quarter-to-quarter. So Q2, in transportation, for example, was a particularly challenging time for us. I think you'll see some odd seasonality on year-on-year comparisons there. But I would think of FY '21 really a pretty normal year for us. Alex Kramm Makes sense. Thanks. Jonathan Gear Thank you. Lance Uggla Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Andrew Steinerman Hi, Jon. Could you just -- I know you just said on transport, the May quarter will have this kind of disproportional pop to make the 12% to 15% organic revenue growth for the year. Could you just be a little more directional and kind of in the -- kind of current quarter, how that's trending, knowing that the May quarter will be kind of disproportional year-over-year comparison? Jonathan Gear Sure. We will do, Andrew. And I will kind of call you to take a look at the supplemental, you kind of see what happened in FY '20, and then I’ll kind of tell you to see what’s going to happen FY '21. But if we just go back over on what happened last year, as a reminder, when COVID hit, we gave significant price concessions voluntarily, particularly in transportation in Q2 a little bit, I would also add Andrew, in Q3, it leaked a little bit into Q3. As we look forward now right now, so first the industry overall has seen a strong recovery in the second half of 2020. In fact, I just tried to buy -- turning safety and I try to buy a used car, it's very hard to find a used car right now and speaks to the strength of the industry. But I did use CARFAX basically to find a great car, I would recommend it to you, Andrew. But if you look for the industry has recovered there. So as we see that performance in FY '21, we're seeing a pretty healthy industry, particularly at the dealership level. As Edouard mentioned, we do work closely and support the health of our dealer customers. So we're being careful as to how we look at value capture the price increase the timing around that. But right now we're seeing our customers doing pretty well and that's reflected in kind of our expectations. But Edouard anything else you want to comment on? Edouard Tavernier No, I think you covered the key points, Jonathan. There is a seasonality effect, right. If you look at 2020, we took a significant haircut in Q2 on revenues, even as we work in on our cost base in Q3, revenue started coming back in when costs were low, and that it creates some seasonality in the margin accretion. And you're going to see some of that play out in 2021 in the comps. But otherwise, you captured all the key points, Jonathan. Thank you. Andrew Steinerman Thank you. Appreciate it. Lance Uggla Thanks. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ashish Sabadra Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. So my question is on the S&amp;P strategic rationale and revenue synergies, as both teams have had chance to spend some more time. Can you just talk about the ability to develop new product and improve commercialization of inflows Data Lake by combining it with S&amp;P's Kensho as well as the power of combining inflows Data Lake with S&amp;P's market intelligence platform? And if you can talk about just the new product development as well as improved distribution of data asset, how that can help going forward. Thanks. Lance Uggla Sure. Okay. Well, we'll maybe focus this question around market intelligence and financial services, because that is the area where we have substantive product related synergies. And it really -- and I'll pass it to Adam to add on to this as well. But if we start with the Data Lake and Kensho, the Data Lake is where I just mark it has been 3 years organizing all of its alternative data sets into a common library with ease of access for both our internal use, as well as now to commercialize to customers. So we've done the heavy lifting to organize those datasets. S&amp;P Global acquired the Kensho assets, which are advanced analytics data science experts, which have scale and size, that are very excited to begin -- to be able to begin working with the information alternative data sets that we have to help provide new forms of decision-making schools, decision-making signals, as well as trading signals, alerts and just deeper decision making tools and ways that without the organized data sets tied to advanced analytics platform like Kensho, you don't have the same opportunity to do so. So that's the first thing. The second thing is market intelligence is a platform that has hundreds of thousands of users that are active on the platform. And that gives us an opportunity for direct distribution, as well as the buildup of tools and services to be offered on the platform. And I'll let Adam add on to that because there's several other ways the two financial services groups that Adam will lead have revenue synergies mapped out and excited about going forward. Adam? Adam Kansler Yes, thanks, Lance. A lot of this was discussed by both Doug and Lance at the time of the merger. And I think a lot of those themes remain true, and as we've continued to explore and get ready for integration, a lot of those original themes have played out. And that's really looking at the scale of data and insights available to the combined business. The ability to put the massive data sets and content available through the market intelligence platform into some of the technology solutions we offer to our customers in their reg and compliance, risk management workflows should be a real game changer in their ability to make decisions and us to give them a very efficient platform for consuming those wide ranging datasets. If you look for -- look at a corporate customer group, automotive, oil and gas, engineering companies will have the opportunity to give them both financial market and risk capabilities they need to run their business, but also data tools capabilities, let them thrive in their core markets with deep industry specific expertise, market insight and including things like asset valuations which we have been able to give before because of the -- really -- that expertise that we're now bringing to that core customer set that's a user of the market intelligence products. So that -- those are sort of the key areas. It's really the combination of a cross asset cross industry data set with workflow solutions already touching many of those same customers. Lance Uggla Thanks, Adam. Next question. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Lance, just kind of two questions I want to sneak in. First is just the Data Lake went fully live I think in the summer, I just want to ask you to comment a little about what the uptake from customers were? Did it really validate the fact that you'll be able to improve the selling motion over there that seems to be a key kind of point that you're hoping to capitalize on with Kensho being able to use a lot of the stuff that's in the Data Lake? And then just maybe for Jonathan, what are you assuming for events in the year? Are you assuming that we're not going to go back to any live events and what would be events revenue be in kind of a normalized year? Thank you. Lance Uggla Okay. Let me start with that. Yes, so the Data Lake we launched the commercialization in the first half of 2020. And we started off with several proof-of-concepts with bigger active large users, hedge funds, banks that have big decision making, strategies around the use of alternative data. And so far, we started to commercialize those relationships, turn them into longer term contracts. Contracts are reasonably sized with term and give the customers the ability to be able to access parts or all of the library for defined decision-making purposes. So -- and then sometimes, the ability to create some form of redistribution that fits into their own products and services that wouldn't cannibalize our datasets. So we're building out two things. One, the pipeline of customers. Two, we've now started to convert the customers, I don't want to say we've converted 100 customers, but we've definitely have converted 10 customers in the year, so that's starting to pick up. We have a great pipeline and we have numerous ways of creating the commercial set. Somebody is typing -- oh, you must be typing your notes, right? Shlomo Rosenbaum Yes, I put that up. Sorry about that. I don’t want to just come in through. Lance Uggla That’s all right. Okay. So then the next bit that I'd like to say is that, for us the Data Lake gives us a speed of development of new products, but also this ability to attach our content with our customers content and give them new unique ways of leveraging and utilizing the data sets. So we see a bunch of efficiencies, and a bunch of commercial activities, of which we've started to get a positive trend going on those already. Of the second part of the questions on the events, I'll pass it over to Jonathan. Jonathan Gear Great. Thanks, Lance. So on the events, as we know, we offer events throughout the year. But Q2 is our heavy, heavy events month from a revenue perspective, where we have our three large flagship events of CERAWeek, the World Petrochemical Conference and the TPM Conference in our Maritime segment. We are not planning on holding those physical events this year. So when we look at our forecast -- revenue forecast for the year, we've taken that -- we’ve anticipated no revenue from physical events. We are, however, holding virtual events in those three events. The revenue from those is significantly lower, Shlomo. So don't expect to see a significant pop there. But I think it's important way for our teams to continue to lead the industry and lead in with our customers and help connect the industry during these times. So again, you won't see any revenue -- significant revenue from events for us in FY '21, but we will be holding the events virtually. Lance Uggla Can I add, Jonathan, as we -- one of the things I'd say, Shlomo, that I was quite impressed with is with the -- with virtual events we do have experience running CERAWeek India last year, which we did with positive revenue. And so we're applying that virtual model to the bigger CERAWeek event for 2021. And I have to say that the customer take up in terms of participating on in the events, as well as sponsoring and participating from a commercial perspective, has been reasonable. And so I've been quite impressed with the team's work. I know, they've involved me with some of the discussions in building some of the panels up et cetera. But they're doing a great job and I know they won't be able to produce the revenue they did physically, but they sure are building some momentum to add some revenue, positive revenue for virtual events as well. And let's see how that plays out in the quarter going into next quarter, but they'll definitely have a number. Thanks. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hamzah Mazari Happy New Year. My question is just on the S&amp;P transaction expected to close second half. Any next steps or milestones, any delays you expect from an antitrust perspective? Are there divestitures you have to do? How long do you expect the HSR process to take, sort of any color around that would be great, Lance? Thank you so much. Lance Uggla Okay. Well, first off, our expectation is that it will close in the second half. We don't see anything specifically. That's going to create any substantive hurdles. So all the hurdles that we knew going into it in terms of the business overlap within our Platts and Opus's businesses are there, and the teams are working to address those. And so my view is, there shouldn't be any significant roadblocks or hurdles. We'd expect to close in the second half and expect the teams to work with the regulatory bodies to determine the precise nature of the overlap of any assets, which is substantive is insignificant in terms of size across the transaction. I don't know, Jonathan, anything else you want to add or is that …? Jonathan Gear I think you have it right, Lance. We've already started engaging with the government regulators, it's a very positive engagement there. And I mean, as Lance said, I just reiterate what he said, we see no surprises this year. Given the size of this transaction, it of course requires appropriate review by government agencies. But there's nothing I think that we see, nor have we heard any feedback that would cause us any concern. And it's just the nature of the size of it, I think it will be second half completed. Hamzah Mazari Thank you so much. Lance Uggla Excellent. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. George Tong Hi, thanks. Good morning. Diving a bit deeper into transportation, you expect organic growth to be in the 12% to 15% range in 2021. And you mentioned dealers are performing relatively well. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the health of dealers and OEMs? And what needs to change at the customer level for you to hit your targets? Also, can you discuss a bit whether you've seen any negative impact from the full reversal now of earlier pricing concessions and transportation? Lance Uggla Edouard? Edouard Tavernier Yes. Hi, George. Thanks for the question. So in terms of what we've assumed in our forecast in our plans is a continuation of current rates, right, which means a market in the U.S is probably down roughly 10% year-on-year. It means continuing challenges with inventories and it means by and large, significant volumes of both used cars and new cars and most dealers remaining open, even if there are kind of local business restrictions. So we have factored in all of those risks. And we can execute on our plan and our forecast within the current market environment. In terms of what we're seeing in the dealer market and signposts about the health, I would say a couple of things. Like, in the end, many dealers had a very strong 2020 because even though volumes were down, because they have to lower costs and because inventories were very low, the margins by and large, were high and dealers remained profitable throughout 2020. So in fact, most dealers are in pretty good shape coming in into 2021 and expects to remain in pretty good shape. They expect prices to remain pretty solid throughout the year. What they do see is uncertainty, right, and that uncertainty means there is risk. It means they're not bringing in all of the costs back into the dealership. And it means that there may be some ups and downs throughout the year. By and large that is the market environment we are seeing today, and that is the environment in which we can execute on our plan. George, that was the first question. Can you just remind me what the second question was? George Tong Yes. If there has been any negative impact from the full reversal now of pricing concessions? Edouard Tavernier Yes, it's a great question. Thanks for asking it. So I think we mentioned on the Q3 call, that as we were removing the pricing concessions, we would be tracking the retention rates very, very closely through Q3 and Q4. Well, the great news is, it remained very, very strong, right. So our cancellation rates have remained low, even as we took out the option to suspend service and we're very happy about this. If you remember back in Q2, when the crisis struck, we said, the most important thing for our business is to make sure that when we come out of the crisis, we come out with customer relationships that are even stronger than they were coming into the crisis. That's why we made hard decisions. That's why we took the short-term kind of revenue hit because we believe that we had to do to get through the pandemic. I think we're coming out of it in the right place with very strong customer relationships with critical products and with high retention rates. Lance Uggla Thank you, Edouard. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line at Jeff Silber with BMO. Your line is now open. Jeff Silber Thank you so much. I've had a few investors ask me this question, so I'll just ask you. Can you talk a little bit about morale and internal turnover at your company since the merger announcement, especially in light of last month's announcement of the new divisional structure for the combined company? Thanks. Lance Uggla Okay. So, no, it's a good question. So there's not a lot of product sales, management overlaps in terms of the products and services that both companies offer. And we have a lot of opportunity for revenue synergies, where we're going to have to apply new people to work on the new opportunity sets. So therefore, the synergies come across all of the shared services. And of course, in a merger like this, we put in retention in order to keep the team's well motivated, intact with performance, successful performance, related retention that ties into us executing the deal really well. And that goes across the executives, including myself that will stay on post closing to help make sure the deals have success. And other people across the shared services that may not be having long-term roles, but their short-term roles are very important and therefore we structure in compensation to help make that happen. I have to say, as we went into the end of the year, post the merger announcement, we really had -- and the pandemic, we've really been operating that the absolute highest satisfaction levels in the firm that we've ever had. It's been a real pleasure, motivating people through the pandemic, getting the teams working on, running the company in a tough time doing the merger. And post the merger, we've announced our hub platform, JV with CME, our Cappitech acquisition, there's no stopping. And this is the company that's going into a close of a merger in the second half. We're still doing the things that IHS Markit has been designed to do and does very well. And so, no, I'm very pleased with how everybody has responded, the morale and how we're treating employees that may be without a long-term job post the close. Jeff Silber Can you disclose the dollar -- Oh, I'm sorry. just the [multiple speakers]? Lance Uggla The dollar amount of the synergy? Jeff Silber Of the retention. Yes, the retentions. Lance Uggla Yes, I think it's all done. Jonathan, do you want to talk whatever has been disclosed there? Jonathan Gear So then that was -- I was over talked obviously. The dollar amount of the retention on fees. Lance Uggla Yes, please. Yes, our total retention pools across the two companies. Jonathan Gear Sure. So we created a $60 million retention pool, which we had announced at the time of the merger. And that's a cash pool being used to retained that jobs, which could potentially be at risk. Now, I'll emphasize potentially, as you can imagine, you do a merger like this, a lot of excitement at the individual level, people worry about what it means for me personally. And that retention pool really allows, as Lance said, it basically buys time for people to kind of see what their future looks like kind of going forward and kind of derisk the delivery of this year. But the $60 million pool which we've -- which we began to roll out shortly after announcing the merger. Jeff Silber Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much. Lance Uggla Thank you. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open. Andrew Nicholas Great. Thank you. I was hoping you could speak a little bit more to the Hub announcement you made last week, certainly a handful of major players coming together for that initiative. And so I'm wondering if you could speak to the specific set of middle and/or back office solutions the company is targeting? I think there's already a handful of skilled players in that space, so I want to make sure I understand where and the asset manager operation stack hub plan to play? And then also how hub will be differentiated versus some of the incumbents in that space. Thank you. Lance Uggla Right. Okay. Well, hub initiates out of two very large customers that were looking at opportunities to create efficiencies with respect to technology going forward. And those were announced in the press release PIMCO and Man Group. And they have a very close relation given the PIMCO CEO, was formerly the Man Group CEO. So close relationship and both CEOs looking at the forward use of two new technologies to create efficiencies in the total cost of ownership of the solutions that they're needed. And so Hub's initial job is to build a foundation of client transaction and reference data, storage for the management of the activities of the middle and back office of an asset manager. So therefore reducing the inefficiencies that happen from using multiple different systems. And you know it -- it's early stage. Microsoft as a partner is, of course, a choice of Azure with respect to the build and advisory on the build. McKinsey, of course, great partner who has worked -- who are working with asset managers who are trying to make their forward technology decisions. And State Street, great partner because they manage the outsourced back office for PIMCO and ourselves, who have a lot of experience that data management and the build out of financial services technologies. So it's really a joint venture of [indiscernible], where we have many, many owners who are going to own a build of a foundation technology, that will help bring asset management total cost of ownership down across the middle and back office functional needs to better manage those datasets. And it will be a platform that connect -- will connect to all the industry administrators over time. Various software assets, OMS, PMS risk management, risk attribution pricing, a real integrated hub, hence the name that looks to reduce the costs of management data with respect to a big asset manager. And the two asset managers that are announced in the transaction, of course, they have a lot of knowledge and IP themselves, and will be putting that expertise to work as we look at the forward plans of Hub. I don't know, Adam, if you want to add anything else, or we can pause there and -- okay, so we'll go for the next question. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan Thank you. ESG is a high growth area and it will be an important part of your future with S&amp;P. And for S&amp;P, we know that their ESG revenue is about $60 million annualized growing at about 40%. How big is your ESG revenue and how fast is it growing? And are there any specific products or areas that you can talk about that you're focused on for this year, in particular? Thanks. Lance Uggla Right. That's a good question, Toni. Our revenues as Doug and I mentioned in the combination are slightly larger, but they're a little bit different than what you'd call the purebred ESG revenues because we don't have an ESG rating products per se, we have a whole bunch of products that really play into the E of ESG, and will be naturally combined and will create synergies with the S&amp;P products. So for example, we have a carbon registry, which is where we’re -- where we have voluntary emissions receipts that are used for carbon offsets. We also build carbon auction platforms Costa Rica, California, Quebec, to name a few. And those auction platforms for pricing of carbon locally in a state or a region or a country are increasingly important and we'll continue to build those out. And then within our energy and transportation businesses, of course, we have a lot of geo-location data around all the energy-related assets, which are important to the climate discussions going forward. We have a lot of data with respect to some of the land use around agriculture. We have, of course, knowledge of the tailpipe emissions of all the automotive fleets. So we have these, what you would call is within all of our businesses, we have parts of the E of ESG. And when we combine that with the ESG rating services, the Trucost, the RobecoSAM's of S&amp;P Global, we start to have a much more significant circa $125 million to $150 million of kind of base revenues that need to be brought together and then continued to grow at double digits. Doug has mentioned the 40% publicly. We've never really talked about our growth rate, but it's also strong double digits. Toni Kaplan Thank you. Lance Uggla Thanks, Toni. Next question, maybe our final one. Operator Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Andrew Jeffrey Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate you squeezing me in here at the end. Lance, actually wanted to ask a question about financial services, which has been such a steady business for you and specifically in solutions and Ipreo, can you give us an update on sort of performance of alternatives broadly? And then I wonder, if you might talk a little bit about a couple of trends. And I wonder if you're participating here, if you have any thoughts, and those would be Bitcoin, and the emergence of SPACs as funding vehicles, are those areas where you think Ipreo can monetize over time along with alternatives? Lance Uggla Now, those are both good questions, and I'll start and then Adam can conclude. So first off, our financial services business has proved even through this tough year of the pandemic to provide us strong mid-single-digit recurring revenue growth. And I don't see that waning going forward. And I think with the synergies has an opportunity to accelerate. Ipreo, as an acquisition and now hopefully embedded part of our financial services business is accretive to our growth. And it's accretive to our growth, because of the market activity that occurred this year through the pandemic, but equally the alternatives business, which brings me to that second part of your question, which is I think we're one of two platforms that significantly plays in the alternative space, private equity, private debt and the provision of services that will help the GP LP relationship managed more effectively. And that strong double-digit growth for us, whether it's valuations, whether it's reporting, whether it's our new index JV, we've got some real exciting growth assets and ones that we can continue to build on. We don't have any plans at the moment, I don't know about S&amp;P Global, but ourselves. With respect to Bitcoin, maybe Adam is going to correct me in a moment but I'll leave him to do so, but not that nothing big and significant. Of course, we have every millennial that works for us, thinks we should have a major pricing data services, software, in participation around a marketplace that is really legitimizing itself. So we've got to take it seriously. And so, I expect pricing and data services, et cetera that we normally would provide any OTC pricing or contracts, those types of things, we'll be looking to value and participate. The second part, which you mentioned was facts. Well, to me, facts are just another form of a new issue. So therefore the Ipreo teams through their activities, stay on top of all the new issuance. And so as SPAC participates into the marketplace, if there's any follow on equity activity, et cetera, of course, they would be participating. But in terms of this setup for management, that's not something that we do. But I imagine the data sets, et cetera will be ones as they continue to grow that we've got to keep track of. Adam, do you want to add anything else to that? Adam Kansler I think you covered things well, Lance. Maybe two quick comments. First on the Ipreo acquisition, I mean that really is fully integrated today. So we don't look at it separately, but each of those businesses is continued to perform really well, really providing central market infrastructure in a couple of places in highly volatile and really complicated financial markets over this past year, and it performed incredibly well and brought transparency and enhanced capabilities. And that includes, you mentioned SPACs, the level of issuance in the SPAC market, many of those transactions, again carried through our platforms. In the alternatives segment of that Ipreo business, combination with our existing capabilities like valuation, data management, the expansion into credit asset classes has proven to be consistent with where the markets are going. The increased flow of capital into those spaces, has positioned those businesses well to be market leaders in providing portfolio management tools, risk management tools, in particular data management tools. We go forward to both GP and LP community, those businesses have grown well up into the double digits over this past year. And we see that for the next several years ahead. And the last point I'd make is around crypto. Though not a singular focus for us, we obviously are responding to our customers needs to be able to value those products. You'll see last November, we announced a partnership with a firm called Lukka. We have several other tactical partnerships, so we do collect a lot of different pricing and reference data and other valuation information around cryptocurrencies in order to help customers value portfolios that may include cryptocurrencies. So it's an area we'll continue to focus not just on the valuations side, but probably even moving into the index side and near future as well. Lance Uggla Okay, thanks.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug? Doug Peterson Thank you, Chip. Good morning and welcome to today's earnings call. Before I talk about our third quarter financial highlights, I want to thank our people at S&amp;P Global for their dedication and commitment in this extremely unusual and challenging times. Our people remained focus on supporting each other, our customers and our communities through this ongoing pandemic and I've been impressed that our people have been putting relative time and research [technical difficulty] navigate the uncertainty of the pandemic. We are fortunate that the vast majority of our employees can work remotely and continue to deliver highest value to our customers. Now let me begin with our third quarter financial highlights. S&amp;P Global continues to perform well in the current environment and all four businesses delivered revenue growth. Ratings once again delivered the strongest revenue growth in part due to 94% increase in US high yield issuance. During our first quarter earnings call, we explained the expense controls we're putting in place to manage through the pandemic, based on the strong performance we've delivered year-to-date. We've begun to unwind some of these controls. Most importantly, we begun hiring again and open position. In addition, our incentive accruals were increased substantially during the third quarter to reflect this strong performance and we're pleased to increase our full year 2020 guidance by $0.50 to $0.55 which Ewout will discuss in a moment. I'd also like to share some additional highlights for the third quarter. Our investment and growth initiative continues to result new product launches, additional data sets and new technology enhancements. We've made great progress across all four divisions in ESG as our recently launched products are gaining traction in the market. We also continue to be committed to running our operations in the most cost-effective manner and we're introducing a new $120 million productivity program today which Ewout will discuss in a moment. We've recently refinanced a portion of our outstanding debt extending maturities at lower rates and we continue to design and re-imagine the workplace of the future by incorporating technology solutions to transform how we serve our customers, where we work and how we work. The project is still underway and we hope to share the outcome with you on the fourth quarter earnings call. To recap the financial results for the third quarter, revenue increased 9% to $1.8 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 11% and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 52.9% and this was despite a catch up to our incentive compensation accrual of over $50 million. As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on a trailing four-quarter basis which increased 370 basis points to 53.8%. In addition shares outstanding decreased 2% over the past year contributing to the 16% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. Each quarter, we highlight a few key drivers to our business and important projects underway. This quarter let's start with ratings issuance trends. During the third quarter, global bond issuance increased 7%. If we also include bank loan ratings volume, total global issuance increased 4%. Here's some key points regarding third quarter issuance. First; the further we get from the March credit sell off, the more investors have been purchasing weaker credits. Second, yields on US non-financial corporate debt are near all-time lows bringing issuers into the market. In fact, there were two large investment grade corporates that issued debt in September to replace that they just issued in March. And third, despite the strong US issuance that has occurred in the last two quarters. We've identified more than 60 issuers that have issued at least $5 billion between 2017 and 2019 that have not tapped the bond market this year. They're on the what we call are, what are you waiting for list. Turning to the data, in the US bond issuance in aggregate increased 9% as investment grade decreased 5%, high yield increased 94%, public finance increased 25% reaching the highest third quarter issuance in the last 10 years and structured finance decreased 12% with large reductions in CLOs and CMBS partially offset by a gain in ABS. European bond issuance decreased 8% as investment grade decreased 7%, high yield increased 3% and structured finance decreased 17% due to reductions in every asset class except RMBS which posted a large increase. In Asia, bond issuance increased 19% overall. During the quarter, ratings completed five domestic ratings in China, bringing the total to-date to 18. In addition the PBOC, CSRC and SAFE, jointly released a draft policy to attract international investors to the domestic bond market on September 2, which indicates another round of opening of China's capital markets. The draft policy includes suggested actions to simplify the market access process integrate access to interbank bond market and exchange bond market and reduce foreign exchange control. There are two major bond markets in China; one is the interbank market where we received a license to operate from the PBOC in 2019. The other is the exchange market which is regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission just last week we successfully filed a registration with the CSRC to raise products on China's exchange bond market. This means we have the widest remit of any wholly foreign owned credit rating agency in the market and one that is on par with the domestic players. Bank loan rating activities is not captured in issuance data since it's an important element of ratings revenue. We'd like to disclose this bank loan rating revenue each quarter. In the third quarter, it decreased 28% from the prior period to $58 million. High yield bonds were clearly the preferred options for issuers again this quarter. On this slide, we look at the total amount of global debt outstanding, as you can see it's been growing every year by an average of $884 billion or approximately 5%. In the first nine months of this year, the amount of global debt outstanding increased by over $1.2 billion clearly a significant increase. This is a slide that we've shared with you in the past. What is noticeably different is that the duration of newly issued US investment grade high yield bonds have diverged in 2020 with investment grade duration extending out to almost 13 years and high yield contracting to close to seven years. While many companies would like to extend maturities to take advantage of historically low rates only the higher quality credits are able to do so. As the total amount of US investment grade debt outstanding has increased significantly in 2020 most of that increase has come from longer dated maturity. While the volume of debt outstanding of maturities have gone to five years is similar to what it was in early 2020. Next, we analyze upcoming maturity data from different points in time. As you can see approximately 9% of 2021 maturities have been refinanced year-to-date while this is global data. If we look at the US data, we find that in the full year of 2019 maturities coming due to the following year in 2020 will reduce by 15%. While in the first nine months of 2020 maturities coming due in the following year in 2021 will reduce by 18%. So part of the flurry of issuance in the last two quarters has included a slight increase in the pull forward of near-term debt. The big unknown is how much delayed pull forward exists. An example would be a company, that issued new debt to increase liquidity and sitting on the cash. There may be a point when a bond maturity comes due in the next year or two and they use this cash to pay it down. However, the real question is, will they still have the cash on hand? Will they have burned through the cash during the pandemic? That will depend on the individual company and the impact of the pandemic on that company. So we conclude there has been a slight increase in pull forward activity of 2021 maturities. More pronounced is the surge of new issuance that has created an uptick in the growth of total global corporate debt. Turning to our investments in growth initiative, let me start with ESG. We've been providing the market with data and insights on sustainability for over 20 years. But over the past few years and now during the pandemic, we see increasing and accelerating demand for clear, consistent and comprehensive ESG data and solutions. And we have an ESG strategy based off of leading products across all four divisions. In Ratings in the second quarter, 15 ESG evaluations were completed or in progress. In the third quarter it was up to 61. In the second quarter we completed three green evaluations and in the third quarter, we completed 13. In Market Intelligence, we recently launched the S&amp;P Global ESG Scores and have closed seven deals to-date. In Indices, we have $6.1 billion of ESG ETF AUM at the end of last year. As of the end of the third quarter, it was up over 50% to $9.5 billion. In addition, let me highlight a few other new products. Last quarter we shared with you that our Trucost Climate data has been integrated into our portfolio analytics product. We've since integrated the full suite of Trucost data into the Market Intelligence platform. We have now successfully made all of our Trucost data available through all of our distribution avenues which include the Market Intelligence platform, Xpressfeed and the Cloud [ph]. If you'd like to better understand what content is available. It's showcased on the S&amp;P Global marketplace. Now our clients can combine the Trucost data with other S&amp;P Global data for a more integrated customer experience. In building a powerful benchmark, establishing a network effect [ph] is critical. To that end, we had two new launches of products based on S&amp;P 500 ESG index, a State Street ETF and CBOE options. [Technical difficulty] 500 ESG ETF, futures and option and insurance product all reinforce each other to make the S&amp;P 500 ESG index more relevant to the market. Next to our launch, four new climate ETF's based on S&amp;P Dow Jones Paris-aligned Climate Indices. The ETF's will integrate the greenhouse gas emissions of the entire value chain of any given company while also taking physical risk to business activity from extreme climate events into account. Platts launched the first European price assessment for sustainable aviation fuel. Sustainable aviation fuel is produced from used cooking oil and can be blended with conventional fossil-based aviation fuel. The energy transition consolidated product that was launched on the platform is unique and expands across multiple commodities. Platts has been covering energy transition topics for over 15 years. Users who once had to navigate through numerous platforms and market report can now find this information in a single location. We've had an incredible year of innovation and product launches. Let me highlight a few more that occurred this quarter. Market Intelligence launched ProSpread, this is a remarkable product that many of you might find valuable as it eliminates the time-consuming process of manual input of financial statement data into your workspace. ProSpread is a workflow tool that automates the extraction and spreading of financial data from PDF, JPEG and other image file. Optical character recognition, natural language processing and machine learning are combined to drive extraction from even poor quality PDFs or image files in nine languages, continuous learning, ensures manual adjustments are applied seamlessly to future filing. Next, we've continued our expansion in the coverage of SMEs. This quarter we added data on 10 million European private company profiles with standardized financials to the Market Intelligence platform. On our first quarter, we featured the launch of the S&amp;P Global marketplace our new open access platform where clients can browse and gain access to data sets from all four of our divisions as well as curated third-party data and solutions from Kensho. This quarter reached the milestone of 100 data sets and solutions. We have also completed sales contracts with approximately 50 clients. During the quarter, we completed an enterprise-wide contract with Snowflake. Cloud-based delivery enabled customers to simplify their data management and work with multiple large data sets more efficiently. Since Snowflake is cloud agnostic, the data on the S&amp;P Global marketplace is ready to query and is easily accessible via multiple cloud platforms. We released Beta version of China Credit Analytics Platform. This is an integrated desktop solution that generates credit insights in more than 30 million Chinese private companies using differentiated content and localized analytics aligned with S&amp;P Global standard. The platform is available through dual language user interface that supports both Chinese and English. The CME Group launched a cash-settled (Platts) South American soybean future contract which provides a risk management tool for market participants looking to hedge. The CME Group also launched new Long Grain White Rice future contract. As you know from earlier this year, we acquired Live Rice Index. One of the synergies of acquiring small price reporting agencies is that we are already IOSCO compliant this helps us with the CME Group's decision to list this new futures contract. And finally, we're piloting a microgrid called Distro at the Port of Rotterdam for renewable energy. Distro is a marketplace that connects renewable energy and storage with energy users. It utilizes artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to solve the problem of intermittent renewable energy. It's great to be able to showcase how Platts is bringing its core capabilities and pricing and current energy markets the unique landscape being created by the energy transition. Next, I'd like to provide additional information as we plan for 2021. Let me start with the issuance outlook from our ratings research group. The initial 2020 forecast was for increase of 5% excluding international public finance. It now calls for an increase of 13%, so after issuance go up to 15% in 2019 and a forecast of 13% in 2020. Our ratings research group anticipates that issuance will decrease 3% in 2021. While the forecast calls for 5% gain in financials, non-financial structure and US municipal issuance are expected to decrease 9%, 6% and 1% respectively. Please note that this is an issuance forecast not a revenue forecast. As you see here, our economist forecast global GDP to resume growth in 2021 after decline in 2020. While the correlation between GDP and issuance was severed by the pandemic. We expect a long-term correlation to remain intact. Our economist acknowledged a high degree of uncertainty about the evolution of the Coronavirus pandemic. The current consensus among health experts is that COVID-19 will remain a threat until a vaccine or effective treatment that becomes widely available which could be around mid-2021. The forecast anticipates unevenness in recovery both by country and by industry. As you've seen, we performed well during the pandemic and see business conditions in 2021 that should favor continued relevance of what we do across every business. But as I wrap up my remarks, I want to remind investors that despite the strong performance we've been delivering in the midst of the pandemic, we continue to monitor the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape for risk and contingencies that could impact markets, our clients and possibly our company. These include the ongoing impact of the pandemic on business activity and the timing of approval and delivery of a vaccine. The speed of economic recovery across national regional economies. The US policy environment after the election including bilateral and multilateral international relationships. Public sector economic support through fiscal stimulus and central bank liquidity and interest rate policies, credit market characteristics and commodity market supply, demand and prices. I'll now the turn call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who's going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout. Ewout Steenbergen Thank you, Doug and good morning to all of you on the call. Let me start with our third quarter financial results. Doug offered highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. Well some of the segments have a difference between reported and organic revenue growth, in aggregate they are the same at 9%. Adjusted total expenses increased 7% excluding the acquisitions of Greenwich Associates, 451 Research and RobecoSAM ESG Rating's business. Expenses increased 5%. Much of this increase was due to a $54 million sketch up [ph] to our incentive compensation accruals. Based on our strong performance this year. In addition, we contributed $4 million through the S&amp;P Global Foundation and increased our legal related cost in indices. At the management team we took precautionary steps early into pandemic to control expenses. Those actions were mostly no longer in place, demonstrated our ability to dramatically reduce expenses when necessary without employee layoffs. Adjusted operating profit margin improved 100 basis points based on strong revenue growth that outpaced higher expenses. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the timing of discrete tax adjustments. While the effective tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of discrete tax items, our full year tax rate guidance has been lowered. During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates led a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.04. The only meaningful impacts were in ratings and Market Intelligence, where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $10 million and $5 million respectively. The non-GAAP adjustments this quarter collectively generated a net pretax loss of $311 million. That included $279 million associated with premiums and fees paid to tender, certain notes outstanding, $8 million in gains on depositions primarily from an office building in New Jersey and an IR web hosting business that was part of the SNL acquisition. $5 million associated with a technology impairment, $2 million for Kensho retention related expenses and $32 million in due related amortization. This quarter all four divisions delivered increased revenue three of the four delivered increased adjusted operating profit, on the trailing four-quarter basis adjusted operating profit margin increased significantly in Ratings and Platts while Market Intelligence and Indices at small decreases. As we have discussed Market Intelligence, investment spending remains elevated. I'll provide color on the individual business results in a moment. We recently took advantage of the low interest rate environment and refinanced portion of our outstanding higher interest rate bonds with new lower interest rate bonds. The net results were an increase of about [technical difficulty] $200 million [ph] in bonds after spending [ph] a decrease in annual bond interest expense of $26 million, a reduction in our weighted average cost of debt to 3.1% and an extension of our weighted average tenor to more than 18 years. In fact, our 40-year bond had the second lowest coupon ever for 40-year bond in the US, second only to Alphabet and our 10-year bond carries the same coupon as Apple's. Now turning into the balance sheet, our balance sheet has low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $3.2 billion, debt of $4.1 billion after our recent refinancing and undrawn revolver capacity of $1.2 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our debt ratios remained unchanged despite the recent bonds refinancing due to EBITDA growth. Free cash flow excluding certain items reached $2.2 billion in the first nine-month of the year, an increase of $593 million or 36% over the prior year period. We completed $11 million of share repurchases under the share repurchase program initiated in February 2020. In light of our strong liquidity and increased cash flow, we continue to monitor the status of our share repurchase program in consultation with our Board of Directors due to near term market uncertainty including the pending US election. We're not resuming share repurchases at this point in time however we maintain our long-term target of returning at least 75% of free cash flow to shareholders and we will continue to monitor the markets for the right time to resume share repurchases. Now let's turn to the division results. Ratings revenue increased 13% and excluding the acquisition of the ESG Rating's business from RobecoSAM and CRISIL's acquisition of Greenwich Associates, organic revenue increased 12%. This revenue growth was driven by the increase in issuance, Doug already discussed. Adjusted expenses increased 9% excluding changes in foreign exchange rates adjusted expenses increased 11% due primarily to increase incentive compensation, merit increases and additional headcount primarily from the acquisition of the ESG Rating's business from RobecoSAM and CRISIL's acquisition of Greenwich Associates. In fact over one-third of the expense increase was related to these acquisitions. This resulted in a 16% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 130-basis point increase and adjusted segment operating profit margin. On the trailing four-quarter basis adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 600 basis points to 63.4%. Non-transaction revenue increased 4%. Transaction revenue increased 22%, due to very strong high yield issuance in the US, gains in global sovereign debt and US public finance partially offset by weakness in bank loan ratings. This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets, the largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was the 16% increase in corporates. In addition, financial services revenue increased 6%, structured finance increased 4%, governments increased 35% and the CRISIL and other category increased 2%. It is not often that we highlight sovereign rating's revenue, but it was considerable growth this quarter as a number of countries including Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Croatia and Jordan [indiscernible] the debt markets. On the right side of the slide, you can see the changes in revenue within structured products. The largest changes were in RMBS and CMBS. Turning to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the segment delivered 1% revenue growth due primarily to gains in AUM linked to our indices and data subscription partially offset by reduced exchange traded derivative activity. In the third quarter, we reported a $12 million increase in adjusted expenses due primarily to increased legal related cost, higher compensation from increased headcount and incentives as well as higher professional fees about $8 million of the $12 million is non-recurring. A 7% decrease in adjusted segment operating profit and an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 65.2%, a decrease of 510 basis points. From a trailing four-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 69%. Revenue growth was subdued this quarter as of linked fees increased 2% with gains in ETFs and mutual funds partially offset by decreased over the counter derivative activity. Exchange rate of derivative revenue decreased 7% on reduced rating volumes. Data and Custom subscriptions increased 3% due to a modest increase in end of day and real-time AC fee partially offset by the timing of contract renewals. For our Indices division over the past year, ETF net inflows were $84 billion and market appreciation was $92 billion. This resulted in quarter ending ETF AUM of $1.7 trillion which is 11% higher compared to one-year ago. Our ETF revenue was based on average AUM which increased 12% year-over-year. Sequentially first, second quarter of 2020. ETF net inflows associated with our Indices totaled $5 billion while market appreciation totaled $113 billion. Activity at the CBOE decreased in the third quarter with S&amp;P 500 Index options activity decreasing 22% and VIX futures and options activity decreasing 38%. This was in contrast to increased activity at the CME where the equity complex volume increased 38%. The majority of the gain at the CME was due to the successful launch of the Micro E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures. Excluding this product, the volumes at the CME equity complex increased 4%. Market Intelligence delivered reported revenue growth of 9% and organic growth of 7%. While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to lengthen sales cycles, usage of our key platforms increased 11% year-over-year. Adjusted expenses increased 6% due primarily to acquisitions, compensation and royalties in addition investment spending continues and is beginning to pay off with some of the new product launches that Doug discussed. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 14% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 160 basis points to 33.8%. On the trailing four-quarter basis adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 10 basis points to 32.9%. Looking across the Market Intelligence components, desktop revenue grew 3%, excluding acquisitions and divestments. Data Management Solutions revenue grew 12% and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 11%. And now turning to Platts, reported revenue increased 5% with core subscriptions increasing 7% and global trading services decreasing 6%. GTS revenue decreased mainly due to lower petroleum and gas volumes at ICE and CME. Although recession has reduced oil prices putting cost pressure on many of our customers. Bankruptcy filings are similar to recent years with 38 US exploration and production company filings year-to-date. This compares to 42 in full year 2019 and 28 in 2019 despite this pressure on the industry we have maintained overall renewal rates in the mid 90s. Adjusted expenses decreased 2% due to the divestiture of RigData and management actions. Adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 280 basis points to 55.7%. The trailing four-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 300 basis points to 54.9%. The fastest growing markets during the quarter were Metals and Ag at 12% and Petrochemicals at 7%. After completing our last productivity program in the second quarter, we have identified a number of additional opportunities to reduce future expenses. They can generally be grouped into four categories; real estate, procurement, T&amp;E and IT infrastructure. We've already begun implementing the actions needed to realize these savings however it will take us two to three years to complete all of these items. When we have finished, we expect to realize approximately $120 million in annual savings for my 2019 baseline. And now I would like to share our updated guidance with you, with only one quarter remaining in the year. There is no longer a need to share various scenarios. This slide depicts [ph] the new 2020 guidance and this slide takes our adjusted figures. The second column is our new 2020 adjusted guidance and all of the line items that changed are highlighted. Now let me review our new adjusted guidance. We increased our revenue guidance to a high single-digit increase corporate unallocated expense has been decreased by $10 million to a range of $125 million to $135 million. Operating profit margin is increased by 100 basis points to a range of 52.5% to 53.5%. Interest expense net includes both interest income and interest expense. It has been reduced by $7 million due to the recent changes in our outstanding bonds. The tax rate has been reduced due to tax benefits from foreign operations. These items result in a new adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $11.30 to $11.45. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased to approximately $2.9 billion. In conclusion, 2020 is a shaping up to be a very strong year for S&amp;P Global. While the recession has crippled many industries and companies. Our unique collection of businesses has continued to thrive. In addition despite all of the hardships related to the pandemic, our employees have continued to deliver the highest quality ratings, benchmarks, research data and analytics and delivered an unprecedented number of new product launches. As always, we remain committed to providing transparency for our investors to deliver essential intelligence for our customers and to support sustainable development in our communities. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions. Chip Merritt Thank you, Ewout. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] operator, we'll now take our first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Toni Kaplan And Doug I love the, what are you waiting for list. I thought that was the funniest thing I've heard in a long time. Just wanted to ask about guidance, so last quarter you made a point to say that the guidance increase was partially due to the higher expectations for the rest of the year. This quarter, it seems like the raise is more reflecting the 3QB [ph], is that fair or have your expectations improved for the rest of the year as well? Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Toni. Thanks for your comments, particularly on some of the analytics and the issuance environment and what are you waiting for list. If we look at the guidance, I think it's both reflecting improved performance during the third quarter as well as also slight improved outlook for the fourth quarter. We're definitely are more optimistic with respect to our business performance for the remainder of the year. We think that all businesses are doing well. You see the subscription businesses showing quite good results with respect to their renewal rate, with respect to the overall book of business is going up and you see the [indiscernible] for Platts and Market Intelligence. If we look at the issuance environment for October it has been quite reasonable in terms of continued activity and then also, we expect the index business that was facing certain particular more non-recurring items in the third quarter. We will see that coming back in the fourth quarter as well so overall slight improvement for the fourth quarter in our guidance. So overall therefore we're quite happy that we could raise our guidance for adjusted EPS by $0.50 to $0.55. Toni Kaplan Great and on the international side. International ratings revenue performed really well in the quarter and you provided some of the issuance metrics with Europe down in - Asia up 19, growth up 22 in the quarter for the full international piece. Just hoping you could expand on what drove the revenue outperformance relative to issuance. Was it mix? Was it pricing? How do we think about that? And then I saw that in China you completed the registration in China's exchange bond market yesterday and I just wanted to understand how that increases the opportunity for you and China and how quickly that can sort of take shape. Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Toni, let me take the first part of your question. The 22% growth in international revenue for ratings. Three main drivers that are behind that. First, we saw investment grade corporate issuances very strong in Asia Pacific; we saw increased high yield issuance in Europe and then sovereign ratings was up in quite a strong way during the quarter. So those were the three drivers behind the international growth. Doug Peterson And Toni, let me give you some color on the China. As you know there's two bond markets in China. There's the interbank bond market, there's exchange bond market. The first one, the interbank market is approved the PBOC, we received license last year to operate issuing credit ratings there and then this week we received approval from the CSRC to also operate in exchange bond market. We're now the only wholly owned foreign rating agency that can operate in both markets. So we have a similar situation as any other rating agency in China. But what's also really important in the few weeks the regulators together the PBOC, CSRC and SAFE which is the State Agency for Foreign Exchange. They've issued some new guidelines about market access, access to both markets for foreign players, FX controls. In addition, over the last few months we've seen BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan and others start getting more access to the Chinese market. So when we look at this overall knowing that we've put in place a very strong team. We've started doing issuance of ratings in the markets. We built strong relationships with issuers as well as the investors as well as the banks that are involved in the debt markets. We think that we're very well positioned as the Chinese market continues to reform further in their credit and debt markets. Toni Kaplan Thanks so much, congrats on the quarter. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may ask your question. Manav Patnaik I was just hoping the decline in 3% issuance [indiscernible] next year. If you could just walk through maybe some of the moving pieces particularly around maybe the assumptions around the elections outcome, if that's relevant between the two different policies out there? Doug Peterson Manav, this is Doug. Let me start with that. So when we look at the issuance forecast for next year. First of all, we're coming off of two really strong years of issuance. It was 15% last year, we're expecting up 13% this year and as always there's a lot of moving parts between financial institutions, corporate structured finance etc. So we're looking right now to forecast for next year of 5% up for financial institutions. This is the data coming from our ratings research team. Corporate is down 9%. Structured 6% down. Public finance down 1%. For an aggregate down 3%, that's what makes it up. But recall it, that's just an issuance forecast, that's not our revenue forecast and we're still working on that. I don't think that we've necessarily taken into account what would be the factors that you would see from the election itself directly on that. But we're looking at, there's a lot of cash that's still outstanding. We see that there is an M&amp;A pipeline which has started picking up. There has been a very high level of activity of non-investment grade high yield issuance and we see a lot in the pipeline there. So it's a combination of all of those different factors that we look at for this preliminary forecast for 2021. Manav Patnaik Got it and if I could just ask on the Platts side. I mean I think numbers were fairly solid considering I guess what everyone presumed is a tough backdrop has been a wave of M&amp;A in that market as well. Should we be expecting any drop off or any items to consider as we think about the growth going forward? Ewout Steenbergen Well if you look, Manav at the different components of the Platts revenue growth, indeed we're quite pleased with what we saw this quarter, price reporting up approximately 6%, analytics up somewhere 10%, 11%. But then Global Trading Services is down but we know that can fluctuate period-over-period and the business is overcoming some headwinds. You might recall that last quarter we talked about very small conference business that saw its revenues evaporate in the current environment. So indeed, the Platts results are solid. We're quite pleased with it. If you think about the revenue outlook for the full year probably mid single-digit growth is the best assumption for the remainder of this year and therefore for the full year outlook. Manav Patnaik Got it, thank you guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. You may ask your question. Andrew Nicholas As you think about the target to the goals for your ESG business, which I believe you outlined to be somewhere close to $270 million or so in 2024. I'm wondering what you think are the main factors that will determine whether or not you achieve that goal and maybe asked another way. If we fast forward to 2024 and your ESG business is well above target, why would that be and maybe the same question, if you were to underperform your expectations? Doug Peterson Thank you, Andrew. This is Doug. Well first of all we're very excited about the growth overall in the ESG landscape itself. This is something that's four or five years ago not a lot of - people are talking about and we're still trying to understand what the total addressable market is going to be and we think it's going to continue to get quite large and it will be expanding rapidly. We've seen that over last couple of years as expanded rapidly as more US companies start embracing ESG. In addition, you see that during the pandemic there's been more interest in the S part of ESG, so that's increasing which has brought more interest from ESG itself and in addition, there's a lot of interest on the climate aspect of ESG and climate on its own. So when we look at the, where the growth is going to be coming from, we think that any type of investor whether you're an institutional investor within the insurance industry you might be looking at climate change, you might be looking at physical risk. If you're an endowment or a pension fund, you're starting to hear from the asset owners that they would like to know more about the purpose of the investments and the destination of the funds there and what we see through these types of investors that they're starting to demand more and more clear consistent information that they can build into their models. And so we see as you've seen us present, we believe there's a whole set of product opportunities for us across every single division as well as cross divisional solutions. We have estimated as you know, 40% growth rate. We will be providing updates on that early next year. But we do see that we think that this market is going to grow very rapidly and that we'll be one of the main players in the ESG space. Andrew Nicholas Got it. Thank you and maybe just a follow-up to that. I mean where do you feel like you are or where you stand with respect to your data assets in the ESG. Obviously the RobecoSAM ratings business acquisition is a big piece of that piece. I'm just curios if there are gaps that you're still looking at filling in and whether or not you'd hope to do that organically or via tuck-in M&amp;A and where might those areas of opportunity be? Thank you. Doug Peterson Thank you. First of all both Trucost and the RobecoSAM, the CSA capability that comes over SAM are both top notch, they're better than anybody else in the industry. So we have a great start with both of those in a foundational level. Where we need to continue to add to our portfolio which is more likely organically is more and more data that comes from issuers themselves as example what we're doing with the ESG evaluation product that's in the ratings business. There needs to be a much broader set of data that is going to be used as evaluation. We see the green bond market starting to grow that's not something you can go out and acquire, that's something that you need to build the expertise and start building the data sets. But what's very important also is linking the data, where we find that there's a lot of data set whether it's internal, external and it's lot of our investors and clients want to learn how they can link it better into their own needs. Finally, what I would say is that there are not clear standards yet outside in the market. If you look at what are the disclosure requirements around the world, they are very iffy, spotty, if there are even any at all with ESG and so we're incredibly active across all of the different groups that are setting standards whether it's SASB, Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Ewout is one the founding members of Accounting for Sustainability in the US branch and so we're very active in all of those groups. So we can be at the stable as the standards are set and ensure that then what we're delivering is going to meet all those standards. Andrew Nicholas Got it, thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Kevin McVeigh Follow-up on the 3% issuance decline, the comment versus the revenue. Just any puts and takes on, obviously I don't want to get specific on revenue. But just any puts and takes to think about given the component to the issuance in 2019 and 2020 being so strong, just would you expect kind of the normal delta between issuance relative to revenue or just anything to call out of the way. Doug Peterson Well first of all just related to that, I gave some of the components about the forecast from our ratings research team for next year. But just to give you a couple of examples, in the third quarter there was issuance which was as high as up 94% for high yield in the US and then if you look at another category like covered bonds in worldwide. It was down 40% structured credit or CLOs were down 40% globally. So you saw some really big swings around the globe of different type of issuance. What we're seeing right now between credit conditions themselves between rates with spreads there is a lot of movement across the different asset classes around the world and different regions and so we're trying to balance all of those as we make our forward-looking approach to this. But Ewout is going to add some other comments. Ewout Steenbergen And Kevin, let me build on what Doug just said, the bridge between bond issuance and revenue growth. There are many elements that go into the mix. But you have to think for example is bank loan volumes that come from relatively low base in 2020. We had non-transaction revenue that definitely is going up as you know in a modest pace year-over-year and for example you have to think about the surveillance over the large bump issuance that has been done this year. There's an M&amp;A environment, our new product launches, our commercial conditions. So there's many of those elements that go into the mix in order to bridge from bonds issuance outlook to ultimately ratings revenue growth. Kevin McVeigh It's very helpful and then just a quick follow-up. Are you starting and I'm sure you're - kind of the structural changes and just the data consumption within Market Intelligence and Platts just post-COVID? It just seems like there is definitely more increased frequency of data, query and things like that. Anything to call out? Doug Peterson The only thing to call out right now that we've seen a dramatic increase in usage over the last six months of across every different type of platform we have as you know, we have not been doing conferences. But all of our webinars are up 300%, 400%. There's huge increases in our conference attendees. We see increase in the visits to all of our websites. We had a free COVID micro site that is every single day there's a lot of visits, that with research that we have around COVID. But one of the most important questions that I hear myself and we pick up from our clients really goes to the core of what you started your question with and that is, how do I link my data with your data? How do I link data across different sources so I can use it in my modeling to make decisions? And that's something that we're spending a lot of time one and you can see some of the tools that we've launched over the last six months or last year or so. We've been looking at this very carefully. This goes back to why we bought Kensho and some of the things that they've been delivering. Why today we talked about ProSpread which is a new tool that allows analyst to extract data from JPEGs and PDFs and put into their modeling. So we see that the data modeling, data linking is really a critical need for our clients and we're trying to make sure that we can be at the forefront of that. Kevin McVeigh Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. You may ask your question. Hamzah Mazari My first question is just around issuance specifically what is your market share today in structured finance? And maybe how is that changed overtime and where do you think that can go? Doug Peterson Well let me start, I don't necessarily really track market share and structured finance or any of the different products. What I could say is that across different products there's something like covered bonds is a product that we are very inactive in around the different markets around the world. But things like ABS, CMBS those are areas that we are very active in, there might be some quarter where the type of activity of CMBS doesn't necessarily favor the type of expertise that we have, so sometimes we might not see the same level of market share. But what we're always looking for is that investors are looking at the highest quality criteria and outcomes of ratings. And in fact, one of the things that we're measuring very closely during the pandemic is the quality of the performance of our ratings. We had made a major overhaul of our criteria after the financial crisis and since then we're watching the performance and this is a place it's being tested in and our criteria is holding up and that's one of the reasons you'll see investors asking issuers to ensure that there's an S&amp;P rating on the debt, when it's issued. Hamzah Mazari Got it and just my follow-up question. I know you outlined the $120 million savings plan and we can see the breakdown between realistic, procurement, T&amp;E and IT infrastructure. But maybe just two questions on that, one how is this different versus the prior $100 million or $120 million savings plan that you achieved. And then it seems like every two to three years you have this $120 million bucket. Is there more to go after this as well, after another two to three years? Ewout Steenbergen Good morning, Hamzah, this is Ewout. First on your question how does this differ from the last productivity program? There are a couple of overlaps and a couple of areas that are different. Area where we see an overlap is technology infrastructure. We're still working through older infrastructure that was very Federated technology debt and to clean up all of the debt, so that was the part of the last program and is continued to be a part of the current program. Real estate was the part of the last program but I think that was more reducing real estate where we had excess real estate at certain locations that were not used. Here we see that we're going to be far more searchable with respect to real estate going forward. We're thinking about new models, how we'll operate, how we'll interact, new structured hybrid working models going forward and that will give us the opportunity to optimize our real estate over the next few years. So it's in the same bucket and the same category but slightly different approach. Last time, we were focused on the functional groups and we saw opportunities to optimize functional groups that's not part of this particular program. But we're going to really focus now on our external spends. Procurement is a component of the current program because we believe that we can improve our demand management internally as well as also our contract negotiations going forward. And then travel is coming down which is the same as with respect to real estate that also to do with new models of work going forward. So yes, there are components that are similar but there's also new components that we've added for this productivity program. With respect to second part of your question, is there more to go? I think you've heard me saying that before I think there's a lot of room we have as a company to optimize and we're going to continue to do that. We have a lot of operating leverage, so you may expect us as a company never be satisfied, never say this is enough. I think there's always opportunities to further challenge ourselves, what we can do better in the future. Hamzah Mazari Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. You may ask your question. Alex Kramm Quick one to start on the index business. You mentioned, the year-over-year kind of changes there, but can you talk about quarter-over-quarter in particular on the AUM side? If my math is right, average AUM was up 13% from the second quarter, sorry. But I think revenue was only up 2% so was that the same kind of areas that you highlighted on a year-over-year basis or what really drove the slower increase here quarter-over-quarter? Ewout Steenbergen Alex, good morning. It's the same kind of elements that you see quarter-over-quarter as year-over-year. The ETF flows - the ETF AUMs continue to develop in a favorable way, mutual funds also continue to develop in a favorable way. The main difference is exchange traded derivative volumes. We have seen market volatility coming down and therefore also ETD volumes coming down and that is really driving the lower growth in this particular category on the sequential basis. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. You may ask your question. Craig Huber Doug, just being curious to hear your opinion here as we sort of think out, what the implications of the election. If one side wins versus the other, what it does to policy changes out there and stuff that potentially might happen. How that would impact your outlook as you think out for next year, particularly in the ratings side of the business? Doug Peterson Well, thank you for that and obviously, as you saw when we put up some of the risks and contingencies that we're looking at. We are going to be looking carefully at the outcome from the election. And no matter how the election comes out, we'll be able to work with any administration in the United States. And we think that there will be different types of policies for growth around the globe. Right now, one of the most important things no matter what the outcome of the election is, is to see if there is going to be another stimulus program. The first stimulus program, the PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program, it helped save 13.5 million jobs. And as long as the pandemic is continuing to have its impact on the US around the globe. We think that that right now that probably has a larger impact on the outlook for the economy than the election itself. And so what will happen after the election for any kind of stimulus, what will be some of the policy measures coming out. We believe that, we could work with either administration, no matter what they come up with. But clearly, we'll be watching if there is any additional oversight of the regulatory side, what are going to be the international implications of co-operation, multilateralism, etc. And so these are the types of issues that we would be watching carefully to see what would be the impact over to the business side from a new administration. Craig Huber And then my other question, what's your feeling on the M&amp;A environment out there? As it pertains broadly to the ratings mark as you think about Europe and the US, you're in this very low interest rate environment as things progressively get better on the economic front. Are you guys expecting M&amp;A deal flow out there to pick up materially if you think out over the next year or so and what does that mean for your ratings business, please? Doug Peterson This is one of the things when Ewout was talking earlier about what are some of the factors that we look at to see what would be the some of the drivers of revenues in the ratings business that even in a lower issuance environment, M&amp;A would definitely be one of those. We do see a pent-up demand for M&amp;A. We see a lot of deals that have started getting done despite the pandemic and despite social distancing. The pipeline of M&amp;A was really weak, it dropped almost all-time lows in the second and third quarter of this year, but it started picking up and what we see in the pipeline is also starting to pick up. M&amp;A, typically will bring along with it a potentially a ratings evaluation service, there could be a bridge loan, there could be depending on what type of high yield or investment grade type of transaction it is, there could end up being another rating that comes out of it. So M&amp;A is always a very positive leading indicator for the ratings business. One final thing I'd say that, we're also looking carefully at M&amp;A, I would call it M&amp;A, it's a little bit different, let's call it restructuring because there is a lot of restructuring going on at the deeper end of the credit. And so higher yield's credits that are going through bankruptcies and restructuring because those also end up usually leading to additional business as well for that in the Ratings business because once something's restructured, they go back out for new loan rating, then potentially a bridge loan which goes to a loan rating, which then could go into the bond rating. So M&amp;A is a very important leading indicator for us and we do see it starting to pick up. Craig Huber Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Jeff Silber Thanks so much. Doug, at the beginning of your remarks, I think you were joking. But you talk about the - what are you waiting for list? What do you think those companies are waiting for? Are they concentrated in a specific industry that's under pressure? I'm just curious if there were any attributes that you seek in these companies and do we expect this company to get off and issue debt. Thanks. Doug Peterson Yeah, it is a joke that I said that - there is no specific characteristic of those companies that haven't come to market yet. There are a lot that are sitting on a large amount of capital. There is a couple of possibilities. One is that they have more than enough liquidity already or they're not industries that are strained at all by the pandemic, it could also be that they already issued more recently in the last couple of years. As you know, we're in an environment where interest rates have been low for a while, especially in Europe, in Japan. You've seen very low interest rates in those markets for a long time and even in the US, interest rates have been low. So just probably that they have enough liquidity, they don't have a need for lowering their interest expense or they've got other more immediate demands, but we are expecting though. So one of the things that we would expect is it some point in time CFOs and Treasurers might start asking the question. Well, shouldn't I go ahead and restructure my debt or issue new debt at these kinds of rate. So that's what we're watching that as a potential pipeline in the future for issuance. Jeff Silber Okay, great. That's helpful. And then Ewout, you talked about in terms of share repurchase or potential share repurchase that you're monitoring the markets for the right time to resume. Can you share with us what are you looking for exactly before starting to repurchase shares? Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen Yes, Jeff, what we are looking for is more stable market conditions to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program. In our assessment, over the next few weeks, we might see a higher level of volatility with the US elections, with the resurgence of COVID cases around the world. So we're watching it's very closely and we'll determine what is the right moment to restart our share repurchase program. I would like to add there Jeff that overall, our capital framework remains unchanged. So we are still having the target of a return of 75% of free cash flow over time, so we will continue with that. As you know, our balance sheet is rock solid. We have a high level of liquidity. We have low leverage, high cash balance. So this is really to do with timing, we watch this very closely. And when the expected future volatility is coming down, we think it's the right moment to restart. Jeff Silber Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. George Tong Good morning. I wanted to just dive deeper into your issuance forecast for next year. You talked about corporate issuance being down 9%. Can you elaborate on your investment grade and high yield expectations within corporate in the US and international markets? Doug Peterson I don't have enough detail to do that yet. And what I'd like to do is when we come back in the next earnings call where we're going to be providing you the 2021 guidance. Let us bring back a little bit more color on that at that point in time. George Tong Okay. Got it. And then as it relates to your new $120 million savings program. Can you discuss how these savings will be distributed among the four segments? And if you expect the full $120 million in savings to flow through to margins or if they will be partially offset by reinvestments [ph]? Ewout Steenbergen Yes, that's a great question, George. If we look at the way how the $120 million will flow through the different segments. I think, the best assumption should be in the same way as you see the overall expense base for the company at the moment. So the highest expense base is in Market Intelligence, then in Ratings and then the other two divisions. So as a proxy, I would say that's probably the best assumption at this moment. Why? Because Market Intelligence has the highest number of employees, so they will benefit from the real estate reduction as well as from the travel reduction, but also Ratings will take a large share of that. So definitely is going to be an element that will help future margin expansion. Your question about reinvestments, we are of course baking that in. We're doing some reinvestments already this year. Think about the investments in our digital infrastructure, working from home, setting up our employees, digital interactions with our customers. There might also be certain investments with respect to impairments that we would expect over the next periods. So an impairment for example of some real estate in the fourth quarter and the first half of next year in order to achieve the run rate savings going forward. George Tong Got it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. We will now take our final question from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. You may ask your question. Owen Lau Could you please expand a little bit on the China credit analytics program? How much additional investment you expect to spend on MI in China and the opportunity of Market Intelligence in China? Any more color would be helpful. Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen Owen, the investments that we are already doing and are part of the overall investment program of Market Intelligence, the investment for the analytics platform in China. You already see in the current results of Market Intelligence. So Market Intelligence is taking a little bit more than half of the overall investment spend of the company. So if I look at the investment spend in the third quarter in total and that's for all initiatives for the company $30 million. $30 million and then a little bit more than half is in Market Intelligence. And of that in Market Intelligence, it's supporting multiple initiatives, the SME initiative, the marketplace initiative and also the China credits initiative. I'm not going to give you the specific number for China credits, but you should expect it's a couple of million of dollars, but again it's already in the current levels of the results that you see at this moment. Doug Peterson And Owen, let me add that based on some of the information I shared with you earlier. We see that the Chinese financial markets are still going to be undergoing lots of reform. The reform that the domestic regulators would like to see a more global market, they'd like to see a more transparent market and this is going to play to all of our divisions and obviously we're out front right now with the rating agency and Market Intelligence is building a very strong platform of delivering data and analytics, similar to what we deliver in other markets around the world. Owen Lau Got it. That's very helpful. Just one final question quickly on the expense guidance. How much percentage of the run rate we should expect S&amp;P can save maybe in 2021 and 2022? And finally to cut 100% of that $120 million. Ewout Steenbergen A component of it will come in quite quickly and that has to do with the fact that certain initiatives are already in flight at the moment. And again, we are taking the 2019 expense levels as a base. So for example, we would not expect the travel and entertainment expenses to come up in that level, so that would be basically a say, if we have already realized at this point in time. Also some other elements that will come in quite quickly. But for the remainder we need the next two year to three years. So I would say a reasonable part next year and then the rest will come in gradually over the next two year or three years. Owen Lau Got it. Thank you very much. Doug Peterson Thank you, Owen. And with that, let me close. First of all, I want to thank all of the investors who have joined the call today for your support. Thank the analysts for joining and your questions. As usual, you always ask very good questions that help us run our business better. Throughout the pandemic, we've been able to accelerate our digital transformation, we've been able to deliver very innovative products and meet the needs of our clients in the markets. With all of the uncertainty, they have been looking for more and more analytical information for research and we're pleased that our people have been able to deliver that. But we would have never been able to do this without the hard work, dedication and perseverance of our employees and I want to thank them today on this call. So thank you to all of our employees and thank you all who have joined the call today. Operator That concludes this morning's call.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Eric Boyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Boyer Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 2020 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q3 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter based on non-GAAP measures are adjusted numbers, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, whole or in part, without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit’s filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO and Jonathan Gear, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions. With that, it’s my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance Uggla. Lance? Lance Uggla Okay, thank you, Eric and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 earnings call. Today, we will review our Q3 performance, outlook for the rest of the year and provide an update on our 2021 expectations that we introduced on the call in the second quarter. In Q3, we delivered solid results as the markets we operate in have begun to recover at varying speeds. We are positioned to deliver results for the year that include recurring organic revenue growth, strong margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth on a normalized basis. As a company, we have used the COVID environment to become more efficient by rethinking how we collaborate, service our customers and innovate. We have adapted to a virtual work environment and are effectively utilizing technology to connect in new ways with colleagues and customers. We expect this experience to have permanent changes in how we operate going forward, including more flexible work arrangements, a reduced office footprint, less travel and increased productivity. The early cost management as a result of COVID accelerated some longer term actions that have enabled us to actually increase our overall investments in growth-related activities during 2020 over prior years. This gives us further confidence in our ability to achieve our organic growth commitments in 2021 and beyond. Let’s move on to the quarter’s results. When we speak to normalized results, we will be excluding the impact of the aerospace and defense divestiture [chains] [ph] on growth rates for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS as well as the Q3 biennial BPVC on organic revenue growth. Let’s look at the financial highlights in the quarter: revenue of $1.07 billion, which is flat on a normalized organic basis; adjusted EBITDA of $486 million and margin of 45.3%, up 460 basis points year-over-year due to strong and early cost management and adjusted EPS of $0.77, up 16% over the prior year on a normalized basis. Let me provide some segment commentary for our Q3 and rest of year assumptions. Financial services provided steady organic growth of 4%, with 5% recurring growth. Performance was as expected led by a rebound in solutions and solid growth in information somewhat offset by lower Q3 volumes in processing. Information’s key areas of strength, included our core pricing services, valuation services and index businesses. Within solutions, we had a boost from the equity and municipal markets activity and some recovery in our managed services and implementation projects that were delayed due to COVID. Strong performers in solutions included our monitoring services for private markets and loans and corporate actions data and services. As expected, processing was impacted by lower volatility within our derivatives business and lower loan volume year-over-year. Going forward, we continue to expect mid single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment in 2020 with steady Q4 growth in information and solutions and a return to growth within processing. Transportation in Q3 had a strong start to its recovery with organic revenue growth that was flat, but recurring revenue growth, up 5%. Revenue from CARFAX and automotiveMastermind, both returned to growth as pricing for our new and used car dealer customers returned to normal levels as those markets began to rebound. Our dealer retention rates have remained very strong. And we are pleased that our CARFAX for Life free trials during the downturn are seeing strong conversion into paying customers. Now, remember CARFAX for Life, which helps dealers with their service loyalty, operates in a large TAM of over $2 billion and will be an exciting growth driver for our automotive business over the coming years. As expected, we did experience a slower recovery in our new car business, servicing OEMs and parts manufacturers as our customers work through lower new car inventories as a result of their Q2 COVID-related production shutdowns. Nonetheless, even in this part of our portfolio, we expect to grow our subscription base in 2020 as the impact has been mainly in the non-recurring items of revenue. Our maritime and trade business also performed as expected and we are gaining good traction from our new product offerings serving the trade finance commodities markets. Our organic revenue growth guidance for transportation for the year has improved slightly to a decline now of low single-digits for the year. Let’s move over to resources, which reported an organic revenue decline of 9% with the recurring down 5%. Downstream recurring organic growth was strong, while non-recurring revenue was impacted by lower global demand. Our upstream revenue was impacted by customers experiencing operation – operational and financial challenges. And we have partnered with our customers to balance near-term flexibility with longer term agreements, which support future revenue growth, while helping those customers through a difficult time. We have successfully increased the percentage of our upstream data revenue under long-term contracts to now over 50%. We expect normalized organic revenue growth for resources in 2020 to be negative mid single-digits. CMS organic revenue growth normalized for the BPVC was low single-digits as expected, with growth in product design somewhat offset by weakness in ECR and TMT businesses. For the year, we continue to expect normalized organic revenue growth in the low single-digits. Overall, I am very pleased and I feel we are well positioned to deliver solid earnings growth this year and return to strong organic revenue growth in 2021, which I will discuss after Jonathan goes over our Q3 results in more detail. Jonathan? Jonathan Gear Great. Thank you, Lance. Diving into Q3 results, we delivered revenue of $1.07 billion, which represents an organic decline of 1% and total revenue decline of 4%. Normalized organic growth was 0% with recurring growth of 2%. Net income of $163 million and a GAAP EPS of $0.41. Our adjusted EBITDA of $486 million, an increase of 9% on a normalized basis with a margin of 45.3%. This represents a margin expansion of 460 basis points and we also delivered adjusted EPS of $0.77, an increase of 16% on a normalized basis. Moving on to revenue, our Q3 normalized organic of 0% included recurring organic growth of 2% and a non-recurring organic decline of 22% or 18% normalized. This decline in non-recurring was primarily driven by three items, slower delivery of software implementations driven by COVID, continued lower OEM auto activities and finally lower energy consulting and software sales. Moving on to segment performance, our financial services segment drove organic growth of 4%, including 5% recurring in the quarter. Information and solutions in particular has strong performances delivering 4% and 7% organic growth, while processing had an 8% organic decline due to the expected lower volumes year-over-year. Within processing, we do expect a return to growth in Q4 and for the year to be in low single-digits. Our transportation segment delivered organic growth of 0% in the quarter. This included growth of 5% recurring as pricing returned to more normalized levels for our dealer customers and a decline of 12% in non-recurring, primarily driven by continued delays in digital marketing and recall. Our resources segment had 9% organic decline, which is comprised of 5% recurring decline and 39% non-recurring decline. Q3 organic ACV decreased by $34 million in the quarter and our trailing 12-month organic ACV is negative 6% and has been heavily impacted by challenges in the North American energy market as Lance discussed. Our CMS segment delivered 1% normalized organic growth per BPVC, including 2% recurring and a decline of 12% normalized non-recurring. Moving now to profits and margins adjusted EBITDA was $486 million, up $33 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 9% on a normalized basis, with a margin of 45.3%, up 460 basis points. Moving on to our segments, financial services adjusted EBITDA was $226 million, with a margin of 50.7%, up 430 basis points. Financial services margin was driven by strong revenue flow-through benefiting from our Q2 cost reductions. We do expect some moderation in financial services margin in Q4 due both to increased investments and a shift in product mix. Transportation’s adjusted EBITDA was $154 million, with a margin of 51.4%, up 880 basis points driven by a return of dealer revenue and a slower return of variable cost. We do expect margins in Q4 to moderate as expenses tied to revenue come back with a return of growth and also increase investment spending, which will drive future growth. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $86 million, with a margin of 41.5%, a decrease of 230 basis points and CMS adjusted EBITDA was $31 million, with a margin of 25.7%, up 330 basis points. This large increase was driven by the rationalization of a TMT product group, post a divestiture and cost control measures across product design and ECR. Our adjusted EPS was $0.77 per diluted share, an increase of 16% on a normalized basis and 15% in total and our GAAP tax rate was 20% with adjusted tax rate of 18%. Moving on to Q3 free cash flow, we delivered $339 million. As a reminder, our trailing 12-month conversion rate has been impacted by several non-recurring items, including the following. A one-time tax payment in Q4 2019 associated with changes in the U.S. tax provisions. The settlement of our U.S. and UK pension plans Q1 payroll taxes associated with the exercising of a majority of their remaining outstanding options and finally one-time cost tied to the cost reduction efforts in Q2 of this year. Turning to the balance sheet, our Q3 ending debt balance was $5.0 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x on a bank covenant basis and 2.6x net of cash. We continued to manage our balance sheets to provide liquidity and flexibility. We closed the quarter with $157 billion of cash and our Q3 un-drawn revolver balance was approximately $1.182 billion representing a great liquidity position. Our Q3 weighted average diluted share count was 401 million shares and reflected the pause of our repurchase program, which we announced in March. As we indicated during our Q2 earnings call, we did anticipate and expect to return to share buybacks and we announced a redemption of this program in August. We subsequently launched a $200 million ASR on September 1. Moving on to guidance, we remain very confident in our 2020 ranges. We are now trending to the midpoint of our revenue range of $4.28 billion to $4.3 billion. This represents a normalized organic growth rate for the year of between 0% and 1% led by recurring organic growth of 2% to 3%. On adjusted EBITDA, we were also trending to the midpoint of our range of $1.825 billion to 1.835 billion. This represents a margin of 42.7% and applies quarter-over-quarter contraction as our variable costs are reintroduced due to the improving revenue and also due to increased product investment. For adjusted EPS, we are trending to the high-end of our $2.76 to $2.78 range, which represents 10% year-on-year growth. And finally, we do expect free cash flow to run at 50% of adjusted EBITDA. And now, I will pass the call back to Lance to talk about 2021. Lance Uggla Okay, thanks, Jonathan. 2020 has been really an unprecedented period for operating a global information services company. And consistent with Q2, I want to provide comfort in the return to normal in 2021. So as usual, we will provide our formal guidance in November, but remain comfortable with the overall 2021 framework that we have already provided you on our Q2 call. The one item to point out is our decision not to hold physical events in 2021 and to move to a virtual model, which we have talked about as a possibility on the last call. Overall, we are looking for a strong year in 2021. Let me tell you what that includes. So, organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, so that now accounts the lack of physical events, so strong organic revenue growth in 2021. In financial services, be in line with the firm’s growth still in the 6% to 8% range, transportation organic growth, we are now looking at 12% to 15% as we finished 2020 stronger than expected, although the absolute revenue that we are going to have, the amount of that revenue remains relatively the same, resources organic growth of down low single-digits to account for the events and CMS in the mid single-digits. For adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, the ranges remain the same, which imply 100 basis points of margin expansion and 13% to 15% earnings growth. In closing, I feel very good about how we are managing the COVID challenges, while continuing to make the right long-term decisions for the company, shareholders and the communities that we operate in and serve. Finally, I want to thank our shareholders for their support and our colleagues around the world for their continued efforts during these unique times that we find ourselves managing through. So now operator, we are ready to open up the lines for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Gary Bisbee Hey, guys. Good morning. Good to see you... Lance Uggla Hi, Gary. Gary Bisbee …rebound, particularly transportation revenue, I guess my question is around the fiscal ‘20 guidance and I heard your commentary about spend beginning to come back. But if we look at revenue, EBITDA and earnings, in all three cases, it implies not a lot of sequential improvement in revenue growth and sort of in a big step up in cost sequentially. I guess anymore color you can provide and really as we think about margins, any color you can provide on the level of permanent cost savings that have come out of your initial comments plans on that versus what was sort of deferred spending, we should see coming back? Thank you. Lance Uggla Right, right. So, well the costs that we don’t see coming back in 2021. So let’s start off any offices that we closed, of course those are permanent closures. And as I said earlier in the call, we continue to reexamine our forward footprint and we do see with the flexible work arrangements that we feel will carry on forward, we can reduce our footprint and so we will continue to protect those fixed costs that have come out and we will add to that. The second big move that was made through COVID was the move from contract based employees into permanent employees and we used the COVID period to provide that organizational design and change and those are permanent savings that aren’t going to come back at lower – just lower cost per head, and so those are – that would be the second place. The third place I would say is that some of the variable costs with respect to travel and entertainment that have come out this year, we would expect some of those to return but not all of them and maybe less than we had originally thought. So, we see a continued reduction there in terms of that overall spend. Where else, where we have done, where we have made moves on salaries, those types of moves, we have started to bring some of the salaries back to our employees. And as we go into next year, ex the top executives of the company, myself and the reports, I would expect those to be back to normal. And so I don’t know Jonathan, any other fixed takeouts? I would say generally one last one before I hand it to Jonathan, I would say that organizational design, so our ability to flex our global location strategy has been a permanent change that I just think in this COVID period through attrition and the early works done in our investment strategies throughout the year, the teams have really pushed our location strategy and those are permanent reductions in average head cost - average cost per head globally. Jonathan, do you want to add anything that I missed there? Jonathan Gear Yes, sure thing, Lance. So first, it’s, I mean, you covered it well, but the two things I would add is when we think about the cost reductions we took in Q2, three categories, there is a fixed cost, which are gone permanently, and as Lance said is this perfect opportunity or this future opportunities to continue to work our cost structure, there is a natural variable cost that comes with revenue going up and down. And the third is the revenue that we – are the variable costs we chose to kind of squeeze up – squeeze down quite a bit in Q2. And what happened in Q3 is a good news story frankly is the revenue, particularly in transportation came back faster than we expected and faster than as been our ramp back on that variable cost that we have squeezed. The other thing I would call out is investments. We did open up some additional investments starting in Q3 heading into Q4. It certainly will benefit us in 2021 and beyond. But Gary, when it comes back to when you see in Q4, you are going to see the margin at the second level come down a bit really is the fact that our revenue performance was a bit better in Q3 than we expected certainly in transportation. Lance Uggla Hey, thanks, Jonathan. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open. Manav Patnaik Thank you. Good morning. Lance, you have talked a lot about some of the structural changes in your cost base. I guess what I was wondering is in terms of other items, whether it’s your portfolio mix or maybe try to convert some recurring revenue to subscription, are there any other things there you feel like structurally you need to change in the business? Lance Uggla No, I think the – I think when you look at the energy markets, I think you have got just to look forward into 2021, then we have got a negative mid single-digit this year and we are talking low single-digit next year. I really think you have got to look at the supply and demand around the energy markets. So, upstream will remain under pressure, you are going to have lower CapEx and you are going to have some bankruptcies. So, my view is the $600 million of upstream revenues is the only place I feel is structurally challenged as we go into 2021 and the remaining $400 million of energy should be expected to grow high single-digit 7% to 10%. So, my view is that – that’s something that we are going to have to manage through in 2021. The team has done a great job this year in terming out about 50% of the revenues to multiyear contracts. But in that discounting, some of that will flow into ‘21. They have managed bankruptcies and most importantly, they have stepped up for our key customers and helped them through a tough period. So, I actually think the energy guys really had to work hard this year to deliver the results they have delivered, but structurally, they still will be challenged on that $600 million, out of our whatever $4.6 billion, that $600 million is going to still be challenged next year, but the downstream and renewables and agriculture and OPIS and chemicals, all are healthy, recurring revenue growth expected and overall ACV positive. So, I am pleased with the performance there.  Outside of that, we have managed our portfolio well. We have increased our investments in all other parts of the business. And so when I lay out the 6% to 8% organic growth yet next year margin expansion flowing through to 13% to 15% EPS growth, I feel like we are in a really good position looking forward in 2021. And hence a complete lockdown, which would bring the new car market in automotive and the dealer footprint, constrained. Ex that, my view is this we have given you a real good look into ‘21 and throughout ‘20 we have given you the revenue guidance. We have told you what we are going to do on expenses, we managed earnings, we told you what’s going to go into 2021. And so I really feel the team has done an exceptional job here and set us up great for ‘21, so no real big changes to our normal operating plan. Jonathan, do you want to add, I think that covered most of it, anything else? No, okay. Next question? Jonathan Gear I think you covered it, Lance. Thanks. Lance Uggla Okay, thanks. Yes. Next question. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Bill Warmington Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So on… Lance Uggla Hey, Bill. Bill Warmington On annual – on annual contract value for energy, I wanted to ask in terms of the – it sounds like you made a number of improvements on that segment shifting upstream clients to longer term contracts. You are talking about 2021 low single-digit negative organic revenue growth for resources. I wanted to ask what you thought the trajectory of the curve was going to look like for the annual contract value growth and it tipped negative to minus 6% this quarter. When do you think it bottoms and starts moving up? Lance Uggla Yes. Brian, do you want to move up Brian on here? Brian, do you want to handle that one? You are not – you are muted, Brian. Brian Crotty Alright, sorry about that. So Bill, when you look at ACV, right now through the quarter, our upstream group is showing negative ACV, but all the other groups are already showing positive. So, we see a lot of strength in our especially in our clean-tech kind of gas business, good demand for LNG analytics, good demand in plastics and that’s just going to continue through FY ‘21, Lance mentioned bankruptcies, there is also closures that also have been affecting upstream ACV. So, in addition to bankruptcies, you had about 40 companies that have also just shutdown. You saw yesterday, Devon merged with WPX. So, those are factoring into the ACV, but the companies that went into bankruptcy are also coming out of bankruptcy now. So you have companies like Denbury, Whiting Sanches, those companies are now emerging and they are buying our services. Lance Uggla Thanks. Thanks, Brian. No, I think the energy guys have, really managed that shift in business from upstream into the mid and downstream. And we just got to continue to do that. Here. We have got great customer relations, very deep. All customers, you heard shell announcement yesterday in terms of energy transition, and their focus, you heard BP talk about their net zero targets and where they are headed. We have got a lot to offer customers in and around clean tech renewables. And so my view is, is if I look at the TAM, for non fossil fuel driven energy analytics, data, scenario analysis, climate scenarios, ESG, my view is, we are the best firm in the world positioned to drive revenue growth into those segments as we go forward. So all I can tell you is I expect the mid and downstream to grow high single digits to double digits. And I expect that the upstream will wane through ‘21 with recovery into ‘22 and beyond, from a much lower base. And so really, we got to be the architects of that shift in change. But we have done this before, and it, the upstream is $300 million, less than $300 million of data now and about $300 million of analytics and thought leadership so it’s not that it’s not a big problem for the overall firm, but it is a challenge for Brian and his team and they are doing a great job. Next question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff Meuler Yes, thanks and good morning and first fully recognize your two largest segments performed well. So apologies for piling on with another resources question. But the magnitude of the step down and recurring was pretty sizable relative to what we usually see in a subscription based business. So I guess what I am wondering is, are there temporary pricing concessions that quickly come back in resources like you had in transport? Because normally, when I think about trading off for longer term contracts, it’s more that you get the annual price escalator that kicks in, as you trip over on an annual basis. So but are there temporary pricing concessions or anything else you could say? And then, yes, I guess just to clarify, Lance, is the guidance for the outlook for 2021 resources. Is it down low single digits? I think I heard you say that on the call, it’s down single-digits down? Lance Uggla Down low, yes, down low single-digits. So one, two or three to me would be low single-digits in terms of a negative number. And so let me go to the first part of your question. So, I guess, well, first of all, I wouldn’t compare what’s going on in the energy markets to anything anywhere else in the firm. So transportation, here recurring revenue – we have had declines in some non-recurring revenue like recalls. So, government regulatory pressure has waned through COVID and therefore the recall agenda has been slowed down, but in the future, we expect recall to be an active part of our business and we will take the lion’s share of that when it comes our way. The second thing we would say is that with less cars on the lots and less cars being manufactured in ‘20 deal the cars in some ways, I hate to say sell themselves, because there is a lack of supply and therefore easier to sell the cars, less money spent on marketing and audience building. That’s a short-term issue. And then in the used car market, we have seen that accelerate back and all other products showing good demand, our forecasting and ability to deal with shifts in types of cars being manufactured and drive trains, etcetera position us really well. So, don’t compare energy with automotive or transportation. When you get into energy, I really think if you are sitting in my shoes today, I think of this very simply. We got whatever $4.6 billion, $4.7 billion of revenues in IHS Markit. I take it down to the $600 million of upstream, which is less than 300 of data and pre-merger was more than 400. This data in upstream, the declining market and it’s going to find its base and grow from there. So, in our 3-year contracts, after year 1, we put in 7% to 8% growth on average into those datasets. But this is miniscule in the picture of IHS Markit. So, it’s not a dial mover, it helps, but it’s not going to move the dial. So, I think you have to take that $600 million of data and say, okay, number one, the world as long as anybody is on this call is going to live plus all your children are still going to be using fossil fuels. So, we do have $600 million of revenue that’s going to support that piece of the world economies. So, whether it’s 70 million, 80 million or 100 million barrels a day, we need fossil fuels and nobody is connecting, turning on their lights getting to work moving around without some piece of their – the world’s needs in fossil fuels. So, we are going to find our home in data somewhere around $200 million, $250million will be the world leaders will continue to support all of our customers and we are going to help them and leverage that position into energy transition and I feel really lucky that we have got financial markets, transportation and energy right at the core and the epicenter of decisions that are going to happen to drive the energy transition and the beyond zero, net zero world that we are heading to. The second thing I would say is the existing players that remain. So, all the sovereign oil companies, big national oil companies that still have committed resources and of course the small entrepreneurial exploration activities need help in analytics, cost management, they want the thought leadership, they want to understand pricing, forecasting, etcetera. So, I think that our analytics, so the non-data piece of upstream will wane a bit into ‘21 through bankruptcies in difficult times, but again should return to a more normalized, whereas high single-digits, but I would say looking forward, I think of 3% to 5%, mid single-digit growth. So net-net, take the whole firm, you’ve got to take resources, the billion of revenues next year, put it at low negative single-digits and expect it to be low to mid single-digits in ‘22 led by the continued transition both organically or through bolt-on acquisitions that are going to drive our future energy growth and that’s it. That’s how I am running the firm. That’s how the team has been instructed to manage the challenges. And when I put that together across the whole firm, been there before and we just got to execute well. I have got a great team. We have got great customers. And I think from a shareholder perspective, we do exactly what we tell we are going to – we tell you we are going to do and therefore you have got great transparency into our capabilities. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kevin McVeigh Great, thanks. Hey, Lance or Jonathan, as you walk through some of the expense savings, some of that sounds obviously more structural as you think about, does that come to talk to potential increases to come to that 100 basis point target or do you reinvest that back into the business, which would kind of fuel organic growth or a combination of both. Is there anyway to maybe frame what that potential can be and how you redeploy it across the enterprise? Jonathan Gear Yes. Well, COVID, given us a real great vision into our cost footprint in terms of real estate, in terms of where we can hire people to effectively do the jobs in the company, so what’s the location and our ability to actively manage 16,000 people working from home. And I guess nowadays, if somebody is in New York City, in the Finger Lakes, working in Taos, New Mexico or in their summer home in south of France, I can’t really tell anymore, their backgrounds or walls mostly or fake backgrounds, where they want to quote one. And so really we have become experts at managing in this virtual new world and that’s given us a chance to really look at our forward organizational design and I believe through attrition, so not having to let people go. But just managing attrition and managing a forward location strategy, leveraging technology, there is no issue with us thinking that we can expand 100 basis points per annum. Now, your second bit is can you have more and my view is an information services company that’s diversified like we are and diversified means that if you do five things, usually one out of the five is you have got to be focused and it’s a bit challenged and we have always had that. My view is, as we can grow steadily at mid single-digits, 5% to 8% or 6% to 8%, I really feel good about our ability to manage our revenue levers, but they all include services that over time wane in growth as they become saturated and those products end up falling to 2% to 3%, 1% to 3% revenue growth, see, you have got to be fueling the new growth products. So, investment is key. This year, we have invested $7.5 million more than we invested in the previous year in what we call investments in organic growth, both within each of the divisions, but even layering some additional expense over top. So, the teams got to invest. So my view is as I look forward, I don’t really want to expand margin faster than 100 basis points if it’s ever going to cost me a slippage on organic growth below 5%. So, therefore I want to invest, make sure that we push to the high-end of our organic revenue growth range, do it consistently, invest smartly, measure our approach and you know what 100 basis points margin expansion is good margin expansion and it helps us give you double-digit earnings growth that you can expect for the next 3 to 5 years. And I guess at merger, we were negative 2% to flat on revenue growth and 0% to 2%, 2% to 4%, 4% to 6%, 5% to 7%. We made a couple acquisitions, we pushed to 6% to 8%, haven’t missed a thing. We promised 100 basis points every year, you never missed it, promised double-digit earnings growth every year. So, the fact is, is just expect that’s what we are going to do and we will manage through the $600 million of resources challenge, put it behind us drive on grow the new business organically and make sure that we deliver the returns, a vibrant company service our customers well, I think all the metrics are strong and bode well for ‘21. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Andrew Steinerman Good morning, Lance. I wanted to hear more about Ipreo, which I know is now sub-segment into solutions and info. How did Ipreo contribute to organic revenue here in the third quarter and should Ipreo still have a double-digit organic revenue profile over the medium term and why? Lance Uggla I will start. I think Adam is on with me, not sure, but I will start and then if he comes on he can join in with me. Okay. So first off, alternative markets, super strong private markets growth, we have got the leading asset in that space, Andrew. And as far as I can see forward, we are going to grow double-digits in that alternative space. So a piece of that came from Ipreo, which was the eye level piece. We were already doing valuations. We were already doing private debt markets, WSO compliance etcetera. So that net-net altogether, I don’t see any of that waning. And if anything, we are continuing to build into that. On the actual volumes across munis, equities, fixed income in terms of the Ipreo businesses and the corporate solutions, I will let Adam give you some color on. Adam? Adam Kansler Sure. Thanks, Lance. Just maybe as a starting point, we have deeply integrated Ipreo into our businesses at this point. So, we are not forward measuring organic growth within that subset of business part of a much larger whole. Performance has been good over the years, as Lance mentioned, capital markets continue to be open volumes have been strong there. The private markets business is growing at or above our expectations of it. So I think we continue to see it as a large contributor to our growth and I think even looking out farther we think those areas will [Technical Difficulty] Lance Uggla Adam, in my remarks, I called out munis in the quarter, like just in terms of volumes, how are the muni markets through this year? Adam Kansler So municipal markets have been strong as local governments look to address their own capital requirements and low interest rate environments. Most municipalities have looked to refinance their debt and those have been very strong markets over the last 6 months even. Equities markets, that will just get us obviously that’s all when the COVID pandemic first hit, but as everyone on this call knows over the last month, we have seen accelerated equity markets again and we are seeing extended volumes there and the equity markets are one where volume is helpful for us. Lot of those relationships are volume dependent, for good reason so… Lance Uggla Okay, good. Thanks, Adam. Next question? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ashish Sabadra Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the solid quarter and good to see the rebound in transportation. And Lance thanks for providing the details on the CARFAX for Life. Maybe if I can have a two-pronged question just on the auto dealership, you have introduced a lot of new products recently over the last few years. Can you just talk about the penetration for, let’s say, AMM or carfax.com in your existing dealer customer base, how much room runway do you have and how do you accelerate that? And then quickly on the OEM side, you provide some good color there on the recall and digital marketing, when should we start to see that come back as well? Thanks. Lance Uggla Okay, good. Well, I have got Edouard on with me. Edouard, do you want to take that one? Edouard Tavernier Yes, Ashish, thanks for your question and great point. So, we do work with a vast majority of dealers in the North American market one way or the other. The great news is we have a portfolio of products as you mentioned with different levels of penetration for each of those products. So if you take a mature product like CARFAX advantage, then we are approaching kind of maximum penetration. The great news is we have products like CARFAX used car listings or CARFAX for Life, which has plenty of runway and which we see growing for a number of years ahead of us, same story for Mastermind. Mastermind has been growing its penetration rapidly over the past 2 years, but frankly, we still have most of the markets to go after and we are continuing to introduce new offerings like our used car capability this summer, which gives us plenty more growth for the future. Lance Uggla Thanks, Edouard. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open. Shlomo Rosenbaum Hey, thank you for taking my question. So Lance, the clear message over the last several years has definitely been that you are focused on the long-term or sustainable organic growth. And in that vein, can you talk a little bit about the nature of the stepped up investments that you have made during COVID, more of the move towards getting the technology to be cloud-native where you are kind of the 3-year plan and what’s going on with kind of the data lake commercializing just kind of an overall update and where you are in the investments? Lance Uggla Okay, excellent. Okay, so I will break that in two and then if Adam, sorry, if Yaacov wants to come in after me, if I leave anything out on the data lake or our tech journey, be happy for you to add to that Yaacov. So the first thing I would say, is, every year since merger, we have increased the absolute dollars we have spend on organic growth investments. So all of our divisions have, in their regular planning cycle, are incrementally investing in their business. But every year, we also run almost like a shark tank approach to what we call incremental investments that can be above our, or internal rate of return, targets for investing in every year, that number has been higher since merger. So we are getting increasing confidence in our ability to invest, and then execute a result that leads to an expanded organic growth. And I have mentioned a bit and maybe we do an investor day, we could really dig into our internal vitality score. And our vitality score is our measurement of this year’s organic revenue coming from internal investments made over the last three years, or it’s longer than the last three years, they have never been less than double the firm’s organic growth results. So if we produce, 5% organic growth, we would leave it in if it was better than 10%. Because sometimes our investments take a bit longer to come in but if they’re operating at double our firm growth, we feel they are still adding to the vitality of the company. Every single year, since merger, the vitality measurement has improved. The absolute dollars of vitality revenue and the percentage of revenue from vitality has improved. So I feel really good that organic growth investment in IHS Markit has a great cadence and a great story. And it’s really impressive, I was with a reg and compliance head, John Barneson, the other day at a board update on organic, some of the new investments we have made and described the product with circa $1 million of investment over the last year, that’s already has run-rate of heading over $5 million and we will have actual revenue next year of $10 million. Now not every investment we make of 1 million drives 10 million in new revenue. If that was the case, we would be growing at 10%, but the fact is, is the better we get at organic investment, the better this company is. It attracts more – it cracks better people, it’s more exciting to work in, it’s got more of a buzz and people feel they are part of investing in their products with technology to be better. So, I am super happy with that. And I wish I had $50 million every year to incrementally add, but the fact is, we don’t have that, but incrementally, we are continuing to invest at what I would say is a growing cadence, well measured, well managed. The second thing I would say when we merged emerged with IHS Markit and IHS. And after merger you find, you have got technical debt, you have got old technology stacks that you don’t want to just connect to new technology, you actually want to rip them out, throw them away and build something brand new. And that’s been Yaacov’s job. And Yaacov has taken the last 3.5 years building out a world class data lake with a $0.5 billion partnership with Amazon, which puts us completely cloud native. It’s a long-term 7-year deal, which is the data lake is built and now all the products are going cloud-native and the connectivity of all of our key datasets to product development to customers out of the data lake into our cloud-native strategy is changing the profile of IHS Markit substantively. And so those investments are made. They are in our numbers. We have managed to do the CapEx OpEx switch, which is very difficult for companies. We map that into our investments with Amazon. And I just think the team here again, not to keep bragging about them, but this big shifts in info security cloud-native software and data lake architecture, that’s what the best companies in the world are doing and our teams have orchestrated that. Yaacov, maybe you just want to tell our shareholders and our analysts here just a little bit about how you see the journey improving our client connectivity, our organic revenue growth, project development and just anything, maybe 5 minutes that you want to add around our cadence for excellence. Yaacov Mutnikas Thank you, Lance. So, I will just talk about, I will start with the data lake just to give an update on that and if there is time, I will go into technology. So first of all, after extensive internal use of data lake by internal IHS Markit advanced analytics team and some of the business lines, we went to market in May this year, making multi-tenant data lake available to our clients as well as extended our reach to potential partners. We have several sign clients, we have got roughly 15 clients in serious evaluation and we have got 150 active client conversations. We are leveraging our existing broad-based sales force and account management teams in reaching our client base worldwide. We are now building out a multimillion dollar engagement pipeline vis-à-vis data lake and our client. Our client engagements in the context span their financial services, energy and automotive client base since data lake is domain agnostic. We have ingested into the data lake the entirety of IHS Markit structured and semi-structured data, this process is ongoing and it is automated from day one since our data footprint is expanded by way of adding new business domains, e.g., agribusiness and similar. At the end of November, we will release the next version of data lake, which will contain around just shy of 1 million unstructured data items, e.g., research documents and analyst reports that will be catalog, discoverable and curated in a similar way per structured data content. In addition, we will provide some advanced features such as document summarization and other advanced machine learning and AI feature engineering based benefits. This type of functionality forms part and parcel of our unstructured data ingest pipeline. By the end of 2020, we will achieve decentralization and discoverability of our data estate across structured and unstructured data and provide same functionalities to our clients. There is one more step I would like to mention for us to deliver to complete the data lake journey as in connecting relevant the data dots across our entire data estate. So, I will pause here for a moment. Lance Uggla Yes, great, so a lot going on and great question. But key for us has been this tech investment over the last 3 years and we are seeing the results. And I think the team has done a great job. Next question. Operator Our next question comes on the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Andrew Jeffrey Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate you squeezing me in here towards the end of the long productive call. My question is high level, Lance, around pricing. And I am thinking about a few areas. CARFAX for Life stands out as a monetization opportunity. I am also wondering about pricing trends and pricing power within your financial services business and broadly, if 6% to 8% of the organic revenue growth goal, is it possible to parse out how much of that is coming from price recognizing that you are pricing for value? Lance Uggla Yes, I think historically, we have always said, 1% or 2% of our overall growth across the whole firm comes from price. And I don’t know if Jonathan if you want to add any further detail on that, but I think that generally when you look across the whole firm, we get about 1% to 2% organic growth for the – related to price. Jonathan, do you want to add to that? Jonathan Gear Yes, I will just be real brief, Andrew. So when you think about our buildup on the subs line, I was going to start the year at 100%, we have cancellations for whatever reason, our renewal rate has been kind of low to mid 90s and then you build up from there. And as Lance said, pricing we do and it does vary by end markets, the condition of the end markets, think about option right now, it’s more difficult to capture the capture price, given the challenges there. But typically about a couple of points that you get from price, the biggest driver really get on the buildup is really on cross-selling and up-selling products and certainly the focus, as we have talked about this call is around introducing – divesting dollars into innovation and driving new products into that customer base and into our channel, but think about just for your modeling purposes about a couple. Lance Uggla Okay, thank you. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hamzah Mazari Good morning. Thank you. I was just hoping if you could just talk about how you are thinking about free cash flow conversion for next year. I think you are talking about 50% for this year. So any puts and takes to think about around free cash flow for next year. I know you have sort of the EBITDA framework you laid out? Lance Uggla Yes. So 60 to 65, we return back into the 60s, mainly, we had some one-offs this year with the pensions that we posed profitably the teams did a good job there. We had some of the restructuring for COVID. So, the tax costs that were left over from the Trump changes, I think our view is as we go into 2021, we will be back 60% plus. Jonathan, is that accurate? Jonathan Gear It is. And I will just add to it, Lance, as several one-offs this year, those items you mentioned, the pension being a third. And we also had some COVID-related impacts to working capital, working capital typically is positive as we sign a new contract and bill upfront and the support some of our clients took in auto and auto OEMs and energy we have supported slightly different payment terms. But looking forward to next year as we have cycled through, look what happened with our contracts, the one-time items will flush through we expect to be back up to mid 60s next year. Hamzah Mazari Great, thank you. Lance Uggla Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Seth Weber Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for keeping the call going. Just real quickly on the financial services business. Solutions flip back positive here in the quarter. I know, last quarter, you talked about the pipeline being strong. Do you feel like we have turned the corner here in the solutions business and can you just give us any kind of forward commentary for how your customers are thinking about that business? Thanks. Lance Uggla Yes. No, definitely, installing software solutions through COVID has been strained, but the team did do a good job getting us through 2020. We have a strongest pipeline we have ever had across the business. And Adam might want to add a few details into that picture. Adam? Adam Kansler Yes, thanks, Lance. It is an historically lumpy business. You do see variations quarter to quarter, but we have continued to deliver into that high single-digit and in some cases touching double-digit growth through that group. Over this past year, we have actually been focusing more on larger, more comprehensive relationships with our customers. We have focused our product teams on being able to develop those capabilities, so we could provide customers even more value in larger solutions we are seeing and that’s hard to pull through and Lance talked about an exciting pipeline. Really not just more deals, but larger deals and I think once we get past the COVID interruption, because obviously it interrupts our customers’ ability to do larger implementations, I think as we pull through that, we will see continued acceleration there. Lance Uggla Thanks, Adam. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open. Alex Kramm Yes, hey, good morning. Maybe just to round it out on capital allocation and returns, I don’t think we have touched upon this today. You mentioned the $200 million ASR some folks have reached out to me and said they thought that was a little bit small. So maybe just talk about how you think about buybacks in general beyond that $200 million? And then M&amp;A, you mentioned on the resources you are still thinking about tuck-ins, is that across the board in other segments as well or how is the environment looking for you in general as you think about M&amp;A in this environment and coming out of it? Lance Uggla Okay, no, good question. We haven’t had that one for a bit. So, first off on buybacks, we have committed the 50% to 75%. So that’s – nothing has changed on that. I think you can look forward at us and be thinking $200 million to $300 million a quarter is a reasonable cadence for buybacks. Well, maintaining our leverage, sub three times. I think that leads us, half a billion plus, in terms of bolt on acquisitions, and anything above that would require us to, increase our leverage before delivering again. And so we, are good acquirers we, we make great acquisitions in the past. And we are always monitoring the markets. But if you ask me, the return on invested capital on organic growth, versus acquisitions, I would say when the teams are doing their jobs we should always be going after the organic growth. And we definitely increased our cadence of organic growth over the last, three, four years, so I am pleased that we don’t need to acquire to support our long term objectives. What I would say, is, scale matters. And I feel a lot better about being a $30 billion dollar company versus being a $10 billion company. And I think that scale matters didn’t top difficult worlds that we operate in. And so we have done a great job to grow the company, grow our free cash flow, and then use it accordingly. And so the dividend is great for our shareholders, they like that certain cash flow, share buybacks is another way to pay back. And we think given 50% to 75% of our cash, our cash back to shareholders is a good strategy. And if great M&amp;A is there, we have got ample room for bolt-ons. And we have some room on leverage if we wanted to do something a bit bigger. So I can’t say more than that, except that our strategy of that combination is voted well. And we are very cautious on the return on invested capital of all those different strategic alternatives. And so, if COVID brings the cost of assets down, somewhat, that could be good, but actually are multiple, I would love to see our multiple, two or three turns better. So things look a lot cheaper to us. So that is where we are, I wouldn’t expect any strategic change, short term, but you should expect this to always look at what’s best for the company, and best for the long term goals of the company and shareholders. Next question, we must be getting near the end operator. Operator We do have three questions left in the queue. Our next question comes from… Lance Uggla Okay, we will answer all three of them. Operator Perfect. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Silber Thanks so much for squeezing me. And I will be quick. I know you are not giving 2021 guidance towards year end, but if we look at the quarters and using your outlook for the year, does it make sense that you will see year-over-year growth and margin expansion in your fiscal first quarter next year? That’s the last comp, pre-COVID? Thanks. Lance Uggla Yes. Okay. Jonathan, do you want to grab that in terms of our forward model? Jonathan Gear Sure. So – and I will be staying on top of my head a bit here, Jeff, but for Q1 year-over-year of ‘21 compared to ‘20, I think we likely will see some margin expansion just because a lot of our cost reduction took place, going to be an impact in Q2, Q3, Q4. And so Q1 year- over-year is going to be before all the COVID impact that takes place. Certainly, for the year, we do expect to drive over the course of the year, continued margin expansion. Lance Uggla Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Toni Kaplan Thanks a lot. Can you talk about any potential implications you are thinking about from the upcoming U.S. election? If there is a Biden win, maybe that helps globalization, but it could impact resources and maybe transportation given more stringent climate policies or do you view that as the transitions happening anyway, so maybe it’s not as big of a factor? And then actually, if you could help us think about the implications of the energy transition for transportation, I know we just saw the California ban on sales of gasoline powered cars starting in 2035. So, just what are you providing to your auto customers in terms of helping with those policies? Thanks. Lance Uggla Right, okay. Thanks, Toni. So I think Biden drives green. And so in terms of energy transition, everything we are doing around supply chain, maritime measurement of the ESG of the maritime fleet, our ESG advisory and products around our indices into financial markets, I think Biden pushing a green agenda forward is good for us. I also think that Biden, pushing a regulatory compliance driven agenda is also good for a firm like ours. So those two things are things that might bode well. I think that, more free flowing, globalization and better global relationships could be a win for IHS Markit as well. But I have to say volatility and challenging marketplaces, fuel financial markets, services providers, and that hasn’t heard us through COVID. In terms of the automotive sector, Edouard can add to it, but people need as much advice and solutions, and used in new car advice around shifts to ease as they do on combustion engines. And we do provide a lot of services around the drive train and that shift from combustion TVs. But, Edouard, do you want to drive a little bit deeper detail on that? Edouard Tavernier Yes, a couple of quick words turn in response to your question. So as Lance said policy and regulatory uncertainty drives and need for data for decision making by our customers. And so in that sense, this is a interesting environments to create new data assets and new products. You mentioned the California ban. You could have mentioned also the EU revised targets for emissions reduction by 2030, which were published last week. And all of this creates a need for large scale simulation of what does this mean for my business? What does it mean for my portfolio, Lance mentioned innovation. So I would say this whole area of emissions compliance, and electrification is probably the most innovative area of our portfolio. I will give you a couple of examples, next month, where we are releasing a monthly rolling forecast of compliance versus EU, China and U.S. regulations, which is a new tracking and monitoring tool for customers. And in January, we are very excited about this. We are launching a simulation tool that will allow our customers, parts makers as well as carmakers to really run a variety of simulations on the portfolio, their competitors’ portfolio to understand how they achieve compliance cost effectively, so very exciting area for us for customers and the place in which we are focusing a lot of resources. Lance Uggla Thanks, Edouard. Next question. Operator Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. George Tong Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned that you can grow steadily 5% to 8% or 6% to 8% organically driven by consistent if not elevated investments. Is this an increased your long-term organic growth framework? And then related to your long-term framework, you talked about several drivers of permanent cost savings. How did those permanent savings impact your framework for long-term EBITDA margins in the 45% to 47% range? Lance Uggla Yes, so 5% to 7% had been our long-term forecast for driving the firm. And then when we acquired Ipreo, we boosted the – no sorry, we are 4% to 6% and when we acquired Ipreo, we boosted financial service to 6% to 8%. And therefore we raise the overall organic growth forecast of the firm, to 5% to 7%. And I still believe 5% to 7%, the right level of conservatism in terms of what we provide to shareholders, our expectations across the firm. And I have to tell you that there is nobody in the firm that doesn’t want to be at the high end or beating that range, but there is always something that across our company that might put us in 6%, instead of 7% or 5%, instead of 6% and so hence the 5% to 7%. As we go through the year, you can see from our forecast right now on revenue, we have got to pin down to like a $5 million spread. So, we know our revenues and our ability to keep them very, very well. So, I think 5% to 7% is the right level. As we grow things like alternatives, renewable energy, energy transition, our asset management related platform activities, our roles and reg and compliance, these are areas that’s growing double-digit. As those grow and gain additional cadence in the firm and investments play through, I expect those areas to push us up to the higher end. And I would love one day to come on here and say 6 days. But for 2021, we can say 6-day, because we are coming off a 4-year in terms of comps. And so really, I think 6 or 8 next year is not, it’s just it’s not the highest order. It’s a return from a really challenge year. And therefore, I think the more interesting year is 2022, are we back in line for the 5% to 7%. And I have to say hand in my heart, I think we have got more than enough target addressable market to do that. So I don’t worry about our long-term ability to grow revenue, I think we are leading edge with our customers, where we have got great employment practices, even proved right through COVID. With our diversity and inclusion measurements, our community scores with our employees and our community scores with our customers. So feels buoyant, feels good, I feel great about that. When you grow at the top end of the range, you start to grow margin, automatically. But we have a business that’s very global, can easily work from home, can easily deliver many of our solutions virtually and leadership virtually, we just got to use more technology. So we have been investing in more technology. And therefore, I see no problem with IHS Markit being one of those 50% margin companies, like many of our peers, they do a damn good job, they manage expenses, they grow revenue, and they find their home around that high 40% to 50% margin. And I expect us to be there as well. And I don’t want to rush it, because I want to make sure that we are constantly investing in those new market opportunities. And I think we are doing that just fine. And then when you look down through earnings this year, we have always had double-digit earnings, I just said earlier in the call, 13% to 15% because all of a sudden we were fully termed out on our debt. So, no rising interest costs, good management of depreciation, excellent tax team that’s given us a good adjusted tax rate. And so I have to say that all of those mechanisms are in place. And so as the last call of the day, all I can say to you is, I will reiterate again, competence in revenue growth, competence in expense management, competence in the double-digit earnings growth. Our portfolio has been adjusted over the 3 to 4 years since merger. We will continue to fuel the strengths and lessen impacts of challenge markets, we will grow through that. And we have ample opportunity with the free cash flow we have to invest back into our shareholders or into the company for new opportunities. So I think we are – nothing has s really changed except that we have been through the most surreal period of our lives. It’s been tough for customers. We have helped them. It’s been tough for employees and we have reached out to them and delivered for our teams. It’s been tough to build new products virtually, but the teams have managed to do it. So, next year, the only thing I can say to you is, if we get a complete shutdown or lockdown and we have to keep people at home locked up and they are not out on the dealer floors, they are not out buying cars, there is nobody out drilling for oil, the financial markets will continue to operate, they have proven they can do that. It will be another tough year. And I will give you crystal clear transparency in what we are doing every quarter. But I actually think the world is heading towards an eased lockdown situation, not that they are not going to lockdown regional, I think there is going to be all sorts of regional lockdowns. But I don’t see us coming to a complete standstill again in terms of our forward forecast. And if that happens, when we give you our guidance in November, we will have to update it. But at the moment, I think you have got as much knowledge as I do and I hope the transparency is appreciated and thank you for all your support. At this point, Eric, we will end the call. Eric Boyer Yes, we thank you for your interest in IHS Markit. This call can be accessed via replay at 855-859-2056 or international dial-in 404-537-3406, conference ID 3199681 beginning in about 2 hours and running through October 6, 2020.

Doug?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Douglas Peterson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mark. We\\'re pleased to discuss our third quarter results and how we\\'re growing, innovating and executing with discipline even in the face of a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. With each quarter that passes, we see further evidence of the strength of our combined company. While no one could have predicted what this year would have looked like, we have benefited from the diversification of our revenue and profit streams and that ballast has provided great resilience as we continue to navigate choppy waters. .</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\\'s been nearly two years since we announced the merger, and I\\'m proud of the progress we\\'ve made. We continue to put the customer at the core of everything we do and we continue to demonstrate a clear commitment to our people while maintaining a high standard of operational excellence. We have an incredibly bright future, and I\\'m excited to share more with you about our strategic vision at our Investor Day on December 1.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look at our third quarter financial highlights, I want to remind you that the adjusted financial metrics we\\'ll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics in the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period. Revenue decreased 8% year-over-year or 6% ex FX, with growth in four of our six divisions being offset by continued decreases in Ratings, as well as a year-over-year decline in Engineering Solutions this quarter due to the timing impact of a single product that Ewout will discuss later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Recurring revenue increased 2% year-over-year, representing 84% of revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses declined 5% year-over-year as cost synergies and disciplined expense management offset some of the inflationary impact we\\'re seeing in labor and technology. Outside of the Ratings business, we saw an average of approximately 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. We\\'re updating our guidance ranges to reflect continued headwinds in Ratings as well as better-than-expected performance in Indices. Guidance ranges for our other four divisions are unchanged from last quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\\'d also like to share a few other highlights from the third quarter. As I mentioned, we\\'re coming up on two years since the merger was announced and nearly eight months since the close. Our post-merger integration efforts are proceeding on track, but very importantly, we\\'re outperforming on both cost and revenue synergies. Our customer conversations remain encouraging despite the economic environment. We continue to see significant growth in multiple business lines due to secular trends that will likely benefit us for years to come, like energy transition as well as the near-term benefit we see from volatility and the need for insights and analytics in times of turbulence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also remain committed to the capital allocation plan we laid out for you at the time the merger closed. We\\'re on track to deploy the full $12 billion in funds for accelerated share repurchases by year-end. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the commercial success we\\'re seeing in the business. The merger continues to generate encouraging conversations with our customers about the increased value we offer as a combined company. In Market Intelligence, we developed a strong commercial pipeline in September, and we believe we will see a reacceleration of the Desktop business in the fourth quarter. Between Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights, we\\'ve generated well over 3,000 cross-sell referrals since the merger closed, and the conversion rates are strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Despite the issuance environment, our Ratings teams remain highly engaged. We remain connected with investors and issuers to maintain relationships and ensure we have the appropriate understanding of their needs in advance of any recovery in the debt markets. Commodity Insights and Mobility are both seeing significantly improved retention rates relative to recent history as well as strong competitive wins and new customer growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We saw a very important win in our Indices business this quarter as a large Japanese asset manager launched the first cross-asset ETF in Japan based on both iBoxx Fixed Income and S&amp;P Dow Jones Equity Indices. While it\\'s still early in our efforts in cross-asset indices, this launch is powerful proof of the demand for such products among global asset managers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now to recap the financial results for the third quarter. Revenue decreased 8% to $2.86 billion or 6% constant currency. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 12% to $1.3 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 46% as both profits and margin were negatively impacted by the decrease in Ratings transaction revenue, partially offset by cost synergies realized in the quarter. Our non-Ratings businesses in aggregate grew revenue 4% in the quarter compared to prior year. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which was 45.5% as of the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Despite the impact of the issuance environment, we benefited from the resiliency of our businesses as well as disciplined cost management and cost synergies to significantly moderate the impact to our adjusted EPS, which declined only 4% year-over-year. Looking across the six divisions, I\\'m pleased to report positive growth across four of our divisions, with Ratings continuing to work through a difficult issuance cycle and Engineering Solutions entering an off-cycle quarter without the sale of a core product that is released once every two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Throughout the year, we\\'ve seen outsized growth in certain products as customers depend on our data and information to make informed decisions during uncertain times. We saw double-digit revenue growth in multiple product lines as a result. Within our Indices business, revenue from exchange-traded derivatives outperformed our internal expectations, growing nearly 40% year-over-year. Our CDS Indices, which include the CDX and iTraxx index families, increased 66%. Markets continue to recognize our leadership in areas like climate and financial data, and we provide a consolidated platform on which to access information, whether it\\'s tracking market movements, company performance or identifying physical risk from weather events, our customers continue to come to us for help navigating the uncertainty. This is evident in the growth we saw in key product offerings for Market Intelligence, including Trucost and Equities, Data and Analytics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\\'m pleased to mark the first anniversary of the launch of Platts Dimensions Pro, a one-stop experience across Platts benchmark price assessments; news and analytics spanning 13 commodities, including energy transition. Over the last year, we\\'ve continuously increased functionality, introducing new features on a regular basis. This unified platform is gaining clear recognition with active user growth nearly doubling in just the last six months. Moreover, some of our newer benchmarks continue to expand their market presence, our low-sulfur marine fuel assessment is a great indicator of the trajectory of a successful new benchmark. Assessments like this often take multiple years to truly scale and become literal market benchmarks. In the third quarter, approximately 1.3 billion barrels of fuel were traded based on price assessment, representing a 15% increase compared to last year. Our iron ore assessment has been the primary physical market pricing reference for seaborne fine iron ore delivered to China for over 10 years, and it\\'s still growing at an impressive rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We understand the importance of reliable market benchmarks to the secular energy transition story, and we\\'re positioning ourselves for long-term success. The chart on the right shows the cumulative number of new assessments we have launched and energy transition over the last two years. These include a new suite of Australian hydrogen prices covering one of the key producers of this future fuel as well as the Methane Performance Certificate that we believe will be an integral component of low-carbon crude trading.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to issuance. During the third quarter, global-rated issuance decreased 40% year-over-year; in the U.S., rated issuance in aggregate decreased 47%; European-rated issuance decreased 19%; and in Asia, rated issuance declined 47%. High yield was down by 80% year-over-year in both United States and Europe and was down nearly 100% in Asia. Structured finance in Europe was the only positive regional category in the quarter, increasing 7% year-over-year. We\\'ve included additional details on the subcomponents of issuance by region in the slide deck. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to make significant progress in our sustainability products. ESG revenue increased nearly 40% year-over-year to nearly $50 million in the quarter. We saw continued innovation in our ESG indices and the market recognition of our strength.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We launched the S&amp;P Net Zero 2050 Carbon Budget Indices, and we ended the quarter with ESG ETF AUM of $35 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year in a down market. Within Market Intelligence, we launched enhanced Physical Risk Exposure Scores and Financial Impact data sets to support clients as they seek to understand and manage the physical and financial exposure to climate change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Ratings division continues to see success here as well, completing 13 ESG evaluations and 23 Sustainable Financing Opinions in the quarter. One of the most important competitive advantages in our ESG efforts is the Corporate Sustainability Assessment, which is an annual comprehensive assessment completed in partnership with participating companies. The S&amp;P Global brand and everything it stands for continues to drive growth in the number of companies seeking to partner with us in this assessment process. Year-to-date, we\\'ve seen more than 2,300 companies opt in, a more than 25% increase from the same time last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. Beginning with our issuance forecast. Our Ratings research team is expecting an approximately 19% decline in global market issuance, including both rated and unrated issuance for the full year. This compares to the previous forecast of down 16%. Importantly, our financial results and guidance are more closely tied to billed issuance, which can differ materially from market issuance as we described last quarter. Year-to-date, market issuances declined approximately 14%, while billed issuances declined approximately 42%. Based on the trends we saw in September and October, we now expect billed issuance to be down approximately 45% to 50% for the full year. When we look to the broader macroeconomic environment for the rest of 2022, we continue to see further deterioration from what we expected in August. In addition to the downward trend in issuance, our expectations for GDP growth, inflation and the commodities markets have all lowered.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With only two months left in 2022, we wanted to provide what will likely be the final update on some of the macroeconomic indicators we\\'re using to help inform our financial guidance for the year. We\\'ll not be discussing our expectations for 2023 on this call, but we will be closely monitoring both the internal and external indicators of our business over the coming months. And we\\'ll plan to provide our initial 2023 outlook at the customary time when we report our fourth quarter results early next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before I turn the call over to Ewout, I want to thank the incredible people we have at S&amp;P Global. Our people have executed well in a challenging environment this year and have delivered great value for our customers and the organization while managing a complex integration. I\\'m confident that we\\'re well positioned to drive long-term growth and create long-term value for our shareholders. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\\'ll turn the call over to Ewout to walk through financials and guidance. Ewout?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ewout Steenbergen</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Doug. Doug has already discussed the headline financial results, and I would like to cover a few other items. As Doug mentioned, the adjusted financial metrics we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from divested businesses in all periods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adjusted corporate unallocated expenses improved from a year ago, driven by a combination of synergies and reduced incentive costs. Our net interest expense decreased 17% as we benefit from lower average rates due to refinancings following the merger. Adjusted effective tax rate was up modestly, but towards the low end of the guidance range we expect for the full year. As most are aware, we exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the third quarter were approximately $108 million in merger-related expenses. The details of which can be found in the appendix.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, of $965 million. We remain committed to returning the majority of this cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have deployed $11 billion towards share repurchases, and we expect the final $1 billion of our previously announced ASR program to be completed by year-end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We note that the U.S. dollar remained strong against many foreign currencies, and we\\'ve seen a corresponding impact on both our revenue and expenses. As a reminder, approximately 3/4 of our international revenue is invoiced in U.S. dollars, which provides some protection to revenue against FX volatility. In addition to the natural hedges that exist due to the global footprint of our people, we have a hedging program in place that further mitigates the ultimate impact on our earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the third quarter, we saw a $0.03 favorable impact to EPS from foreign exchange and hedging programs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to expenses. We are committed to disciplined expense management in this current environment. And similar to last quarter, we highlight the levers we continue to pull to protect margins where we can while still preserving our investments to drive future growth. Actions taken include pull forward in synergies, a reduction in incentive accruals, adjustments to the timing of certain investments and pausing select hiring and limiting consulting spend in some areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Through cost synergies and other management actions we have taken so far this year, we expect to generate more than $400 million in expense savings for 2022. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the third quarter, we achieved $165 million in cumulative cost synergies and our current annualized run rate is $311 million. I\\'m pleased to report we continue to outperform our initial time line on both revenue and cost synergies year-to-date. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the third quarter is $641 million. Given the outperformance on the timing of our synergies, we now expect to achieve slightly more than the 35% to 40% of total cost synergies in 2022 that we were targeting previously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\\'s turn to the division results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence revenue increased 4% with strong growth in Data and Analytics, offset by slower growth in Desktop and flat growth in Enterprise Solutions. For this quarter, recurring revenue accounted for approximately 96% of Market Intelligence total revenue. Expenses were roughly flat this quarter with increases in compensation expense, cloud spend and outside services being offset by cost synergies and lower incentive compensation. Market Intelligence remains the biggest driver of cost synergies from the merger and the synergy outperformance we have seen year-to-date.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Segment operating profit increased 13%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 260 basis points to 33.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 30.9%. The OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division contributed $19 million in adjusted operating profit to the company. As a reminder, because the JV is a 50% owned joint venture operating independent of the company, we recognize their results on an after-tax basis and do not include the financial results of OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking across Market Intelligence, there was growth in most categories. And on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 3%, Data &amp; Advisory Solutions revenue grew 7%, Enterprise Solutions revenue was flat and Credit &amp; Risk Solutions revenue grew 7%. For Desktop, we saw slower growth this quarter, driven in part by the timing of certain revenue recognition items, and we expect desktop to reaccelerate in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For Enterprise Solutions, the business line continues to see headwinds in several of our volume-driven products that rely on equity and debt capital markets activity under variable subscription terms. Excluding the impact of FX and these volume-driven products, growth across Market Intelligence would have been approximately 7% year-over-year. While we remain confident in the long-term growth of all these product lines, we expect deceleration in categories outside of Desktop to persist in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to Ratings. Ratings continued to face difficult market conditions this quarter as issuance volumes remained muted with revenue decreasing 33% year-over-year. Transaction revenue decreased to 56% on the continued softness in issuance we highlighted earlier. Non-transaction revenue decreased 6% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower Rating Evaluation Services and initial Issuer Credit Ratings, partially offset by increases in CRISIL, ICR and RES revenue are historically correlated with the relative strength of the issuance environment and M&amp;A activity, respectively, and the declines we are seeing here are purely indicative of those market conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Expenses decreased 19%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management, including lower incentive expenses, partially offset by increased salary and fringe expenses. This resulted in a 41% decrease in segment operating profit and a 750 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin to 55.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 57.9%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now looking at Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in Ratings revenue were a 44% decrease in Corporates and a 31% decrease in Structured Finance, driven predominantly by structured credit. In addition, Financial Services decreased 20%, Governments decreased 33%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 9%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And now turning to Commodity Insights, revenue increased 5%, driven by strong performance of subscription products, including those within Price Assessments and Energy &amp; Resources, Data &amp; Insights lines. However, that growth was impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As noted on the slide, revenue related to Russia contributed $12 million in the third quarter last year and made no contribution in the third quarter this year. Excluding this impact, Commodity Insights would have grown approximately 8% in the third quarter. There\\'s no change to the expected impact from this conflict. But as a reminder, on an annualized run rate basis, we expect Commodity Insights revenue and operating income to be lower by approximately $52 million and $51 million, respectively. For this quarter, recurring revenue contributed 91% of Commodity Insights revenues. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Expenses increased 1%, primarily due to salary and fringe and an increase in T&amp;E expense partially offset by merger-related synergies, lower consulting spend and lower real estate costs. Segment operating profit increased 9%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 45.8%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 43.8%. Looking across the Commodity Insights business categories, price assessments grew 8% compared to the prior year, driven by continued commercial momentum and strong subscription growth for market data offerings. Energy &amp; Resources, Data &amp; Insights also grew 8% in the quarter, driven by strength in gas, power and renewables and in petrochemicals. Advisory and Transactional Services decreased 1% in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Upstream business was down 2% compared to prior year, mainly driven by higher comps for Software and Analytics products offerings as well as the impact of Russia. Excluding that impact and the impact of FX, Upstream ACV growth would have been positive in the quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our Mobility division, revenue increased 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued high retention rates and new business growth in CARFAX. For this quarter, recurring revenue contributed 78% of Mobility\\'s total revenue. Expenses grew 5% year-over-year as we have yet to lap planned increases in headcounts, and we saw continued cloud expense growth, which were partially offset by lower data cost and favorable FX. This resulted in a 14% growth in adjusted operating profit and 200 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 40%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for CARFAX as dealerships profitability remain at elevated levels. Manufacturing grew 4% year-over-year, driven by strength in subscriptions and an uptick in the Recall business. Inventory shortfalls continue to temper growth as OEMs spend on marketing initiatives powered by Mobility products remains muted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Financials and other increased 9%, primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting products and new business. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices revenue increased 3% year-over-year with strong margin expansion despite lower assets under management. For the third quarter, recurring revenue contributed 84% of the total for indices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, expenses were roughly flat as strategic investments and higher information services costs were offset primarily by lower incentives and other expenses. Segment operating profit increased 5%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 70.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 68.8%. Asset-linked fees were down 5%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs. Exchange-rated derivative revenue increased 37% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including a more than 60% increase in S&amp;P 500 Index options volume. Data &amp; Custom Subscriptions increased 10%, driven by new business activities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the past year, market depreciation totaled $472 billion. ETF AUM net inflows were $194 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.3 trillion, which is an 11% decrease compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which decreased 4% year-over-year. As a reminder, revenue tends to lag changes in asset prices. Given the declines across equity markets so far in the back half of this year, we continue to expect softness in asset-linked fees as we close out 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Engineering Solutions revenue declined 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by the negative impact of the timing of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. The BPVC contributed approximately $1 million in revenue this quarter compared to approximately $8 million in the year ago period. For this quarter, 94% of Engineering Solutions revenues were classified as recurring. Adjusted expenses decreased 7% due to favorable impact on BPVC royalties. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 19.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Non-subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions decreased 63% year-over-year for the reasons I mentioned on the previous slide, while subscription revenue increased 3% over the same period. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now moving to our guidance. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. And this slide depicts our updated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance due to the continued softening of the issuance environment, we now expect revenue to decrease mid-single digits compared to our prior guidance. Some of that impact is offset by the outperformance in indices. The net impact of our lower ratings revenue expectations, combined with the cost measures and capital allocation measures we have outlined today result in our slightly lower margin outlook and a new adjusted EPS range of $11 to $11.15. This margin outlook reflects our continued expectation for approximately 180 basis points of margin expansion outside of our Ratings business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Interest expense is expected in the range of $345 million to $355 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance due to higher interest on our cash deposits and positive impact from currency hedges. We\\'re also reducing our outlook for capital expenditures to $115 million due to intentional delays in real estate investments. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, is now expected to be approximately $4 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The following slide illustrates our guidance by division. Based on this past quarter\\'s performance, we\\'re updating our expectations for adjusted revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin for Ratings and Indices. The guidance ranges for our other divisions are unchanged. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, despite the geopolitical tensions and a challenging macroeconomic environment weighing on the markets, our portfolio of strong businesses continue to prove resilient. Furthermore, I\\'m pleased with the progress our teams have made since the closing of the merger earlier this year. We look forward to providing you with a deep dive into our businesses and the longer-term outlook of the company at our Investor Day on December 1. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Grant</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Ewout. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our first question comes from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Owen Lau</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the MI Credit Risk Solutions and Data &amp; Advisory Solutions, could you please unpack a little bit on the products and services driving that growth in current backdrop? Are they new customers? Because based on my understanding, many of these products are subscription based. I just want to get a better sense of how you can further monetize it and drive that growth?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Owen, this is Doug, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start, first of all, by mentioning that within Market Intelligence, Credit and Risk Solutions has always been a long-term outperformer. It\\'s an area that we see very high demand from the markets for information about credit risk and other types of risk, especially in this market. As you know, the core products in this area are the basic products that are providing information from the Ratings business. So things like RatingsDirect, RatingsXpress. We also have a suite of products like Credit Analytics. And we do see a lot of growth now related to credit climate analytics. This is an area where we\\'re seeing increased interest and demand, especially from financial institutions, especially large global banks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, we\\'re seeing some other growth from areas like traded market risks some names of, I\\'ll say, ex VA, CCR. We have a VAR product, et cetera. And then we have some additional buy-side risk opportunities for clients to look at for market risk and stress scenarios. So if you look at the entire suite of products, we\\'re able to provide the market information at the time when they really want to understand risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Owen Lau</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. That\\'s very helpful. And then my follow-up is somehow related to the Ratings business. Could you please talk about your view on how private credit market might have impacted S&amp;P Global Rating business? And how S&amp;P can provide services in this area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks. On the private markets, as we saw earlier this year, there was a retreat of institutional investors and retail investors from credit funds. So there was really no liquidity at the beginning part of this year. It was a combination of people that were risk averse and also looking at the shift between fixed and floating. There were a lot of moves in interest rates. So we saw a retreat from the traditional loan funds and high-risk investors that left the markets. That left an opportunity for the private credit funds that had traditionally been focusing on mid-market credit. So SME credit was their expertise. Many of them also had started moving into the higher quality, higher level of risk and large-cap companies. So they were there to fill the gap. The gap was filled by private credit at the beginning of the year. And we know that they\\'ve also been able to take on loans with a faster, also with a higher risk level. And so we\\'ve seen that increase during the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now how do we think about that? First of all, we look at that as an opportunity for us going forward. We believe that the private credit funds will be looking over time to have some sort of risk transformation, whether it\\'s related to fixed floating or it has to do with securitization or syndication. We think at that time, they\\'re going to be wanting some Estimate services, potentially Rating services. In addition, we\\'ve identified private credit as one of our most important strategic growth drivers. We already have a base of private credit businesses that were part of IHS Markit. And related to that, we have a strong starting point with products like iLEVEL provides information to portfolio managers. So we\\'ve identified private credit is a growth area for us for ratings as well as for Market Intelligence going forward. And we\\'re watching the trend very carefully. We know at some point, investors will come back to the markets, and we\\'ll see a broadening of the market again. But we\\'ve been watching this very closely and are actually interested in this as a growth area for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ashish Sabadra </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to drill down further on the Ratings and the issuance guidance. I believe my back of math -- envelope math suggests that you\\'re assuming a similar growth in fourth quarter as third quarter for transaction revenues. I just wanted to see if I\\'m in the right ballpark I was just wondering if you could provide any color on what your expectations are for issuance for the rest of the year. Are you assuming any rebound? And how are the conversations with the issuers coming along?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ashish, if you look at the outlook, as you know, we are not really providing quarterly guidance. So we\\'re not really speaking about the quarterly outlook for either our financial results or some of the input variables like issuance. But of course, if you look at the numbers that we put out today, then if you would do a backward calculation, you would assume that the most recent trends we are seeing in terms of issuance is what we expect to continue also in the fourth quarter. So, definitely, that’s the main reason why we took our guidance down. I would say that\\'s the only reason, because overall the impact on our results from a top line perspective is about $200 million reduction in revenue outlook for the Ratings business, so about $0.50 of EPS. And then there were a couple of smaller things. But net-net, I think that\\'s the main driver of why the EPS outlook is down for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ashish Sabadra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\\'s very helpful color. And maybe just switching gears on Mobility, pretty strong momentum there despite what we are seeing in the auto lending space or in the auto space. And so I was just wondering, as we start to see the demand for auto slow down, how should we think about the growth in the business? Is there some counter-cyclicality as well here in the business?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Ashish, thank you for your questions. When it comes to Mobility, we see that there\\'s a very interesting shift going on over the last couple of years. As you know, when the market started slowing down from the pandemic and the supply chain interruptions, we saw the used auto market really start expanding and we benefited from the CARFAX products and the CARFAX suite of products, especially at the dealer level. We know that there\\'s some counter-cyclicality as you say, it as the market returns to new autos coming into the market and inventories rise that we will benefit from products and services to the OEMs and as well as the dealers are going to start having a different type of relationship again with the manufacturers and suppliers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\\'re watching right now very closely three big trends in the automotive market: what\\'s happening with the used car market where we have a strong position, what\\'s happening with the OEMs and the supply chain for the new automobiles. They\\'ve been in historic lows over the last two years. So we expect that\\'s going to start going up. And then there\\'s also a transformation taking place in the industry as more and more vehicles start to become electric based with the drivetrain as opposed to internal combustion. So a lot of trends, which are all play to our advantage because we have data analytics and research products that we can serve all of the users in these markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Kramm</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I understand that you don\\'t really want to comment much on 2023 quite yet, I guess, we\\'ll wait until December. Just on the issuance side, however, your own research group yesterday put out not only the 2022 update but also the 2023 initial look, which I think calls, if I got this right, for 2% issuance growth and 10% growth, in particular, for the Corporate side, which I think is the most important for you. So since this is out there, I\\'m just wondering how we should be thinking about that forecast? And what\\'s kind of items you would think about as you think about how that flows into billed issuance and revenues? I know it\\'s early, but given that your own company has an issue outlook out there already, figured it\\'s relevant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, Alex. As you say, we produce a report. And what we\\'re looking at right now is, understanding what are going to be the main factors driving us towards the end of the year. We\\'ve given you those in that report as well. That showed that issuance was expected to be down by 19% for the full year, which compared to 16% from our last report. As you know, we will wait to provide guidance for 2023 until February when we provide our full issuance report as well as our guidance for the year. What you saw from the report from our team, our credit research team is product research and it\\'s not necessarily geared directly to how we\\'re going to find billed issuance. As you recall, last quarter, we explained very clearly what is included in billed issuance. We take the -- what would be expectations for issuance overall. We add in leveraged loans. And then we extract some debt areas like unrated categories such as MTNs, most of the domestic debt from China. And we also exclude the international public finance from those calculations to come up with our expectations. But maybe more importantly to your question, we\\'re always in the market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you saw, we talked about having had 3,000 interactions with the markets during the quarter. We are all over the market to understand what are the factors that are going on that are driving issuance and will drive issuance. So we do provide our guidance going forward. But we\\'re looking at the issuance forecast, GDP growth, macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rates. We\\'re looking at spreads, which have been quite high over the last few quarters. Maturity schedules, which are quite encouraging going forward into 2023, \\'24, \\'25, et cetera, M&amp;A pipeline. So as you know, at the time we come out with our guidance, we will have looked at all of these factors. But maybe the most important point is that we\\'re not just standing around and waiting. We\\'re very actively engaged with the markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Kramm</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Fair enough. Then maybe just going to Market Intelligence. I think since the deal was announced or closed, I think we have had this expectation that more and more of the, I guess, subscriptions on the IHS Markit side will be moving onto our S&amp;P kind of enterprise umbrella. So just wondering if that\\'s still true, if there\\'s a time line for moving more and more that legacy market subscription under that S&amp;P umbrella. And yes, how far we\\'re along if you\\'re able to pick up any sort of incremental pricing as you do that? Or how should we think about that transition over time, if that is a plan?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Alex, it\\'s very, very early for us to talk about it. But what I\\'ll tell you is going back to the last comment I made that we\\'re incredibly linked into the markets right now. We have all of our commercial teams are out speaking with our customers. What we\\'re finding is that there\\'s a lot of opportunities for us to start with cross-sell. So our initial early wins have been with cross-sell, selling different products within the divisions and sometimes across the divisions. But we are hearing opportunities for moving data into the Desktop, finding some products for data and research and analytics fit together. So to your point, it\\'s a vision that we have, but it\\'s really early for us to give you any kind of detailed analytics about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Kaplan </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to ask about Ratings margins. They were down sequentially, but they were still really resilient just given the environment and especially relative to one of your big competitors. Just wanted to ask you if you could talk about some drivers that enabled you to flex cost outside of incentive comp?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Toni, you\\'re right. We are quite pleased with the overall expense discipline of the company in the third quarter. You\\'ve heard us announce last quarter that we\\'re taking additional actions to deal with the macro environment and we\\'re actually really pleased how that is playing out, and you may continue to see that kind of a result from us going forward across the company. And of course, we take the benefit also from the cost synergies that we can implement and accelerate during this period. So if you look specifically at the Ratings business, it is a mix. On the one hand, we continue to make sure that we invest in future growth, making sure that we stay competitive on a compensation perspective. We want to preserve the capacity we have on the analytical side. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But on the other hand, there are also discretionary costs that we are bringing down. There are allocated costs that are benefiting from the synergies that we are realizing across the company, and then also incentive compensation is down year-over-year. So it\\'s actually a balance of different elements that go into the mix. But definitely, as you have seen in the past, we\\'re always focused in terms of trying to preserve margins in our business businesses as much as possible, particularly in more challenging macro environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Kaplan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And this is a little bit of a broad question and you could take it where you want. But just -- could you talk about any changes in customer behavior over the last six months, and this could be elongation of the sales cycle in some places? Or maybe it\\'s just different products that have been more in demand? Just wanted to get a sense of sort of changes in the businesses over the last recent history?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Toni, thanks for that question. And as you know, the markets are going through a lot of uncertainty and turmoil. We\\'ve never lived through a period where you have an end of a pandemic, a war, inflation, interest rates going up, all sorts of different impacts. I mentioned earlier on the mobility discussion what kind of impact that\\'s had on the markets overall. We\\'ve seen this interest in talking about risk. It\\'s a topic which has increased dramatically. When we meet with customers, they want to talk about the external environment. They want the expertise of S&amp;P Global that comes from our entire company to understand what\\'s happening with risk, with markets, with credit as well as equities, commodities. So we start with very broad dialogues. And then we dig deeper into some specific topics. One that comes up in almost every single conversation we have is energy transition, climate and sustainability. That\\'s a really common discussion. It\\'s increasing in terms of how much time we spend on it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And another one is Data and Analytics. How are customers thinking about their own application of AI, Data and Analytics? They want to learn from us how we\\'re managing S&amp;P Global, but they also want to learn how they can be deploying new types of products and services using more AI. But overall, we have not seen any kind of initial pushback on slowing down a sales cycle. Clearly, there are some markets, as I mentioned, the ratings market, there\\'s not a lot of issuance right now, but we\\'ve stayed engaged with the market. But maybe net-net, the big topics we spent a lot of time on the macroeconomic environment, sustainability as well as AI and data. Those are big conversations we have in almost every customer interaction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Silber </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to start with a Ratings-related question. I asked your competitor -- your large competitor the same question. I\\'m just wondering like your thoughts. What are you looking for in terms of signs of an uptick in that market, green shoots, et cetera? What should we be focusing on?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\\'s a few things that I\\'m focusing on myself, and I know that if we had our Ratings team specifically on the call, they might tell me that there\\'s others that are looking at beyond that. But clearly, there\\'s a set of factors, M&amp;A activity is one for me, which is -- it\\'s kind of an informal indicator. M&amp;A activity has been quite weak recently. Typical M&amp;A has a set of transactions come along with it, may be a bridge loan, which turns into a deal loan, which turns into a bond or rated loan, et cetera. M&amp;A activity has been weak. IPOs is another one. The reason I look at those myself is that those are just their activity, which denotes confidence in the markets that people are willing to invest. But then as you recall, we\\'re having conversations with issuers. We mentioned 3,000 that we had last quarter with issuers. And we see a lot of interest in investing people that have plans for investing in new markets for innovation, for investing in venture capital, ways that they can see new shoots in their own businesses. So we\\'re watching when is it that people actually pull the trigger. And maybe the takeaway is it\\'s not, if it\\'s when. We know that there\\'s a lot of people out there that are ready to go. They have great ideas, but the question is when will those conditions of interest rates, of stability of market confidence, when will those be back when people start going back to the market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, we do look at the maturity schedules, and we know that there\\'s a point starting towards the middle of next year that there will be maturity schedules are going to start kicking in and we\\'re going to watch that carefully as well. We\\'ll there be pull forward from that, but that\\'s another factor we\\'re going to be watching.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Silber </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That\\'s really helpful. And I can shift over to the Mobility line of business. Margins, at least by our record, looks like it hit an all-time high, even I think compared to IHS\\'s business, and I know it\\'s a different segment right now. But can you talk about what\\'s going on there? And should we expect margins to continue to go higher from here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jeff, we are always aspiring to improve margins across all of our businesses. So mobility is not an exception to that. That is because of the fact that we\\'re focused on operating leverage. We always like to see the top line growing faster than the expense line. And of course, aided then by strategic investments to aim for future growth as well. What we are seeing in the mobility business is really a positive overall environment that helps and is very supportive for the business, particularly with low inventory levels, we see margins high for the OEMs and for the dealers and that is driving high retention rates. The offset of that is that we see lower spend for sales and marketing products that we are having, and that\\'s because of the same factor that the inventory levels are low. So you could say there\\'s a kind of an inherent hedge in that business. If the market starts to turn, if we see that the demand supply starts to shift in the car market, then we would also see those different revenue streams moving in opposite directions. But we think that with that, we\\'re insulated from our overall financial impact, and therefore, we can continue to focus on margin expansion as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as Doug mentioned before, we also are taking a benefit from used car markets, and that has been proven to be quite resilient the cycle. So yes, overall, we are really happy with the growth of mobility, the margins, and we would see that continuing going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">George Tong</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Billed issuance was down 40% in the third quarter. You\\'re assuming full year billed issuance declines of 45% to 50% will be worse than the third quarter decline. What are you seeing that suggests 4Q could potentially be worse than 3Q in terms of billed issuance? Any color there would be helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. First of all, let me just give a little bit more color on that. As you know, at the last forecast, we saw that issuance of the non-financials or Corporates would be down about 30%. We now see it down about 35%. And then we see that in Financial Services, they had expected to be down 10%, now down about 14% or so. When you look at the total billed issuance, and we mentioned that it was going to -- year-to-date was down 42% and we\\'re expecting it to be down now 45%, this is going to be based on what we see in the pipeline. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I mentioned in the answer I gave a few minutes ago, we see that the market itself is quite hesitant. It\\'s not a question of, if, it\\'s a question of when. And we see that during the fourth quarter, what we\\'ve picked up from investment banks from issuers directly that right now, they\\'re still waiting to see what the conditions are going to be around economic growth, interest rates and spreads. So it\\'s just based on our forecast, not our issuance forecast. This is based on our market forecast based on people that are meeting with issuers and meeting with investors that the current conditions are still such that people are holding back before they go to market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">George Tong</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Very helpful. And related to that, we\\'re likely going to be in a higher interest rate environment for some time relative to pre-COVID. What are your thoughts on whether corporates may enter a phase of balance sheet delevering and implications for issuance performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, that\\'s a theoretical question, but let me go back and look at history. I know that many of us have been in the market for many years, remember when interest rates were 4%; 3%, 4%, 5% base rates and the markets were incredibly active. I think that we\\'ll settle into a range once there\\'s stability and we understand what the longer-term rates are going to be, what longer-term inflation and growth are going to be. Companies and financial institutions will go back to the markets because they want to invest and grow. We know that organizations like to grow and to grow, you deploy capital. We also look at the trend around the globe where more and more markets are shifting from being banking markets to capital markets. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right now, in Europe, there\\'s a couple of shifts going on in the support programs that the ECB was providing to the banks. This was very easy, very low-cost funding. They\\'re starting to wean the banks off of those, and they\\'re going to the capital markets to raise more capital as well as to deploy more capital into bonds instead of into loans. So we see this trend of capital marketization around the globe, and we think that\\'s another trend in the long run that will drive a lot of positive tailwinds for the Ratings business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Craig Huber </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My first question on pricing, can you just update us on a like-for-like basis? What would you say the average price increase is this year? And how does it vary across the segments? Is it 3% to 4%? Or is a little bit higher?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Greg. Well, we are always very careful when we speak about pricing in isolation because, first and foremost, we start with customer value. What do we deliver for our customers? And the good news is that based on the very high value of our products and services, we should be able to pass on cost/price increases and to achieve more favorable contract terms and fees over time at renewal. Of course, it depends on facts and circumstances of each and every product, each and every customer situation and of the situation of each and every of our businesses. But that is our overall philosophy. I can\\'t give you specifically a number for across the company, how much price increases are up compared to previous periods, but there are definitely areas where we are looking at price increases or have already implemented price increases that have been higher than in the past. But again, that all has started with that there is a good balance with the overall customer value that we are delivering.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Craig Huber </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My second question, please, on Market Intelligence. Can you just talk a little further about the health of your clients, the sales pipeline there a little bit further? I mean your numbers speak for themselves. How do you feel about the outlook for Market Intelligence right now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We still feel very, very positive, and we\\'re optimistic about the Market Intelligence pipeline. You read every one so about some of the financial institutions here and there that might be slowing down some of their growth, but we\\'re not seeing that in terms of negotiations with clients. But very importantly, one of the propositions of the merger between IHS Markit and S&amp;P Global was to cross-sell the excellent products from both groups to the client bases on the other. We believe that we have a strong diversification of our client base. And as an example, in the IHS Markit businesses, their financial services business was mostly focused on financial services. We\\'re finding that a lot of the opportunities and a lot of our initial cross-sell has been selling IHS Markit products to corporate clients. We think that there is a lot of upside and a lot of opportunity. We are out in the market actively talking with our customers about ways we can bring value through new products, new services through data, et cetera. So right now, we\\'re not seeing any pullback or any kind of major slowdown of our sales activities or pushback from clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Manav Patnaik</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe just specific to Market Intelligence and the Desktop side. Can you just help us understand the accounting issue, I guess, that will help reaccelerate the growth? And then just thinking out a little bit longer in there, how do you expect the trajectory of the growth there to play? Because I mean, similar to yourselves, I imagine the sell side and other customers will be tightening budgets as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Manav. We recognized that the third quarter revenue growth of the Desktop was below our normal growth potential. But you have to look at it from a particular perspective that there is always some timing of revenue recognition of certain contracts. That was particularly impacting this quarter, but we expect the Desktop growth to normalize again in the fourth quarter. Also for Market Intelligence, in general, if you take out the volume effect of the capital markets business, and also FX, then the overall growth for the full quarter was north of 7%, and we believe that\\'s more indicative of the normal growth opportunity for Market Intelligence as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Manav Patnaik </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Got it. And then can I just ask on the non-transaction side of the Ratings business? It\\'s obviously down 2%, I think you said ex FX. But how long will that keep, I guess, slowly declining? Like when do we lap the Ratings evaluation services, tough comps or whatever it is that\\'s driving that down?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, Manav, that is directly correlated with the overall economic environment, capital markets activity, debt issuance, M&amp;A environment. And we have, of course, seen that the beginning of this year was still relatively strong, and it started to deteriorate somewhere from March onwards. Non-transaction revenue is usually quite stable as a revenue stream. We have two particular areas that are mostly sensitive for the more general macro environment. This is initial credit ratings. We don\\'t see a lot of new issuers coming to the market. And then rating evaluation services, this has a correlation with the M&amp;A market. These are issuers that are thinking about IPOs, spin-offs and so on, want to have some kind of an insight in terms of implications for their ratings. So obviously, those are revenue streams that will come back once the markets start to turn. The more stable elements in non-transaction are around surveillance, around frequent issuer programs. And then most notably, I want to point out that CRISIL is doing very well and is supporting the non-transaction revenue in that category.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Meuler </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I hear you that there\\'s some inherent hedges in the Mobility business, but I think the used car business is a decent amount larger than the new car market for you. So if the market, I guess, shifts back from a mix perspective and some of the profit pools for use target hit, I\\'m just wondering if there\\'s a net benefit or a net detriment to you? And I recognize CARFAX has good structural growth, historically resilient. So could you just give us any more detail on what product lines the competitive wins and new customer growth was coming in or any more detail on CARFAX\\'s innovation that\\'s driving the growth, given that the core report is fairly well penetrated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jeff, you\\'re absolutely right that the used car market is a significant component of the overall revenue stream for the Mobility business. And the good news there is that it has been a very resilient market through the cycles. So we\\'re not overly concerned about if the cycle in the car market start to turn that it will have a material impact. And as I mentioned before, we have other revenue streams actually that we expect to pick up if the equilibrium in the car market start to change, particularly about our sales and marketing products where we have seen relatively lower growth in the more recent past. The mobility business in general is a phenomenal business. There\\'s a lot of innovation, a lot of new product developments, a lot of good support for our customers. CARFAX is really a gem from my perspective in terms of growth and in terms of innovation and new business activity, very close to the customers, a lot of new business launches and new product launches. So I think this business is in a very good position, and we would expect -- also if the car markets start to turn and go in a different direction, that we see continued good performance from this segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Meuler </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then, Doug, you answered the deleveraging question. Can you also give us the historical view of like how much issuance was there in a falling rate environment of bonds being issued that was refinancing debt that wasn\\'t coming due the next, say, three, four years but bonds that had significant duration remaining on them where there was issuance to get the interest expense savings from a falling rate environment. Just I guess on the theoretical that we might not have that type of activity for a while, if you could help me understand roughly if that was meaningful in the past or not?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Basically, this is a question about pull forward. And we saw in 2020 and 2021 during the pandemic, there was what we felt now was structural pull forward. It was a combination of low rates, but probably more importantly, if you are a CFO of any organization, you were not being criticized for having ample liquidity during what people didn\\'t understand was the pandemic as we went into it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we did see a lot of structural pull forward during that period. But historically, I think the treasurers and CFOs of organizations are quite thoughtful and looking at their overall funding strategies. And so the funding is not -- when people look at their balance sheet, it\\'s not only just looking at what they have on what their costs are. But the opportunities that organizations have now are much more complex than they used to be. Securitizations, looking at how they\\'re going to use a maturity transformation, what they do in terms of derivatives. So yes, we do see the balance sheets. We do see that there was pull forward into \\'20 and 2021, but we know the maturities are coming now. And we think that the sort of tools that corporations have to -- and banks have to manage their risk and their liquidity have really changed a lot in the last 10 or 15 years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\\'s hard to go back and compare to history, but we do know what happened in the last few years, where we did see pull forward, but the upcoming maturity schedule, which starts in the second half of 2023 going forward, in a sense it\\'s kind of what was all the issuance that came after the financial crisis, in 2013, \\'14, \\'15. Just think about that huge boom of issuance that took place, that\\'s going to start maturing next year. It was a seven-year, 10-year paper. We see a lot of that will start maturing and that -- we know that, that\\'s going to be in the queue very soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Faiza Alwy </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, I just wanted to ask about the commodity business. You mentioned climate transition. So it sounds like there are some underlying drivers that are sustainable. I\\'m curious if you could talk about the cyclical aspects of the business and maybe areas where you\\'re running into tougher comps. And just how sustainable you think the overall growth rate is there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Let me start with giving you an overall perspective on the Commodity Insights business and how it\\'s doing in the current environment, and then I hand it over to Doug more for the energy transition and climate part. So if you look at the overall macro environment, it\\'s very supportive for the Commodity Insight business at this moment. Definitely, where commodity prices are today is benefiting most of our customers. And therefore, we\\'re seeing also, I would say, based on the very attractive proposition of the combined businesses that we have now brought together under the Commodity Insights segment. We\\'re delivering a lot of new opportunities to our customers. And therefore, we have seen really one of the best sales momentums in this business. If I look at actual sales levels, this will probably one of the very best years for the last maybe a decade or so. So very positive trends that we\\'re seeing that is helping Data &amp; Insights that is helping price assessments. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Global Trading Services business was a little lower this quarter. The main reason there is that we\\'re lapping more difficult comps. But generally, we also see elevated hedging activity on commodity prices, and we\\'re also benefiting from that as well. And then if you look at the upstream business, there, we have seen a turnaround. That was a business that for many years was in a more difficult period. But clearly, our customers are healthier there as well. We see larger CapEx budgets for those customers, and that is helping that business to grow. And we said in our prepared remarks that if you take out the effect of Russia, on a constant currency basis, actually the subscription book of business in the upstream business was growing during the quarter. So overall, very favorable macro environment for Commodity Insights, and that is clearly helping the business this quarter and also in the next couple of quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ewout, I just want to add two points. The first is that all of us know that energy transition is on everyone\\'s mind, whether it\\'s a corporation or government, regulator, financial institution. And as I mentioned earlier, almost every conversation we have talks about this. And where else do you want to go to find about -- learn about energy and energy transition? It\\'s commodity insights of S&amp;P Global. We have the expertise. We have the experts that can talk about current markets, transition markets, and we\\'re finding an incredible amount of engagement. We have conferences. It\\'s one of the areas that Commodity Insights excels at. And we see very high demand for people to participate in those conferences and we\\'re now back in person and the attendance is above the charts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But the second point I want to make is that we\\'re launching new products all the time. Just in the last quarter, we launched some new products that were related to energy transition and new ways to find information about markets. As an example, there\\'s -- in the tanker market, we talked earlier in my -- we had one of our points on our slide showed the low-sulfur fuel oil market, which we -- I remember on an earnings call about three years ago talking about when we launched that and now it\\'s become a benchmark in the market. But in addition, there\\'s things like the carbon accounted tanker rate price assessments, there\\'s interest around the world for understanding freight emissions and what would be under the EU emissions trading system. You\\'re going to need to have much more information for every single tanker and what is its carbon output, and we will have a product for that. As an example, there\\'s a whole information that\\'s needed in Brazil and India and Turkey on energy certificates in emerging markets. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then finally, we have some examples. Recently, as you know, in the United States, there was the new climate bill, which was issued by the United States, by the Congress. And we\\'ve done very special research which is really industry-leading about the clean energy procurement and what that\\'s going to mean for industry. So when it comes to energy and energy transition, we’re the place you want to go.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Faiza Alwy </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. That\\'s all very helpful. Just as a follow-up. Ewout, on Market Intelligence. I think you had you had -- the margin performance was really strong. And I\\'m curious if -- is that the area where you\\'re maybe getting the most synergies? Or just give us a little bit more color on the margin performance, whether it\\'s mix related? And how we should think about that going forward..</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Faiza, yes, we\\'re seeing the largest benefit from cost synergies and revenue synergies in the Market Intelligence division. That\\'s because it\\'s the largest division. It\\'s also the largest combination of different businesses that we\\'re bringing together. And also based on the size of that division, it will also benefit, of course, from a large part of the synergies that we\\'re realizing in the corporate center and the allocation of those costs down to the divisions. What you see is, in general, that we continue to invest in Market Intelligence for future growth. So you see new product launches continuing strategic investments in new areas and initiatives. That was already touching on private credit, private markets, ESG investments we\\'re having there as well. We\\'re having expansion still continuing in China, in the marketplace and many different areas that we are continuing to invest as well as cloud expenses. We\\'re also continuing on our cloud journey and Market Intelligence is continuing to invest there as well. But then the opposite factors, there are some of the expense reductions, the expense discipline and the synergies and the combination of all of that led to the significant margin expansion in Market Intelligence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Hans Hoffman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Stephanie. Could you just comment a bit on what you\\'re seeing across your European revenue base and how that region did relative to your expectations either by segment or overall?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, overall, not so much of a different trend we are seeing in Europe compared to other parts of the world. I understand the background of the question because definitely, the economic outlook in Europe is, of course, quite difficult given the inflation levels, given, of course, the close proximity to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But overall, from a customer dynamics perspective, overall in terms of commercial activity, we\\'re not seeing a significant difference compared to North America or Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Hans Hoffman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. That\\'s helpful. And then just on the revenue synergy side, I guess where have you seen the most success so far and then sort of where do you kind of see the most opportunity?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Most success so far, we see in our largest divisions that we\\'re bringing together, Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights in the Index business. It\\'s mostly cross-sell at this moment, which was as expected because cross sell is the introduction of one product group to existing customers and making sure that we can sell new activities there. For example, in Market Intelligence, we had a nice sale of KYC, KY3P product to an existing customer that was more a customer from the legacy S&amp;P Global side where we could sell a product from the legacy IHS Markit side. So just as an example, so we see -- continue to see good cross-sell. At the same time, we\\'re investing in new product development, in system development that will help them with that growth wave going forward. So it\\'s still early, I have to say around revenue synergies, but we are clearly ahead compared to our original expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Russell Quelch from Redburn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Russell Quelch </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to talk about capital allocation priorities. You still got about $2 billion on cash on the balance sheet and you\\'re on course to generate around $5 billion of free cash flow in \\'23, I believe consensus. Just wondered where you look to do further M&amp;A? Or do you have enough integrations on your hand such that you can look to return perhaps north of 100% of free cash flow again in \\'23?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, no change with respect to our capital philosophy, capital management targets. We think consistency and reliability there is the most important, particularly in this environment. You have seen us continuing with the $12 billion ASR, even despite that we have seen some impact of the current environment on the rating issuance levels we are able to execute on our plans this year. And you may expect the same from us over the next couple of years. So at least 85% of return of capital to our shareholders, a combination of dividends and share buybacks, dividend payout ratio between 20% and 30%. And M&amp;A, the focus is really on small tuck-in and bolt-on, where we see that we can add a nice capability to some of our core strategic focus areas, but nothing large because we first, of course, need to focus on the integration of the large merger and organically building out our businesses. So no changes at all, and we think that is actually the right approach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Russell Quelch </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just one housekeeping question, I guess. Given the earlier comment on being able to achieve the lower-than-average rates due to the refinancing of the IHS debt, what\\'s the level of interest that was delivered in Q3, now the right quarterly rate to assume going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. This is the new run rate with respect to the interest expense on our debt. We were very fortunate with hindsight that we refinanced a large part of the debt at the beginning of March when the 10-year U.S. Treasury was around 1.73 at that point in time. So we are very happy that we locked ourselves in with long-term debt at very low levels. And actually, if you look at the average cost of debt for any player in our industry, we\\'re at one of the lowest levels. So yes, this is the normalized level. If you look, though, at the interest expense line, there\\'s one point that I want to make, it\\'s a net number. So we\\'re generating more interest income on our cash balances. So that is helping us a little bit and obviously, that might fluctuate over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shlomo Rosenbaum </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ewout, I just wanted to ask you a little bit about your labor cost trends. Obviously, it\\'s a significant component of costs. Everyone in the industry has been dealing with the rising labor costs given what\\'s going on in the market. What\\'s your outlook for that? And do you see that kind of letting up in terms of just how we should think about the costs of the business on a go-forward basis, let\\'s say, over the next six to 12 months?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Shlomo, obviously, we are exposed as everyone else, to increases from an overall labor market perspective and comp expectations, and we need to stay competitive in order to attract and retain the best talent. So let me expand a little bit on that answer. So about 60% of our overall expense base is people cost. And obviously, we have people across the whole world in many different job groups and categories. It\\'s not a one-size-fits-all. We see more competitive situations in certain markets and jurisdictions. We see it more in certain job groups. And we are continuously making sure that we stay competitive from an overall comp perspective. And we will continue to do that. So we\\'re definitely expecting to see also some of the changes over the next period flowing through our P&amp;L. But at the same time, we are also taking advantage of a lot of levers that we are having and maybe levers that are given to us through the merger. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have, of course, the opportunity to realize cost synergies and reduction of headcount is an element to that. So that goes in an opposite direction as well as synergies, cost synergies around real estate, around procurement. And then as you see this year, given the performance of the company, also incentive compensation costs are down and we gave you the overall impact of around $120 million to $140 million. So it is a bit of a mix. On the one hand, staying competitive from a labor market perspective; but on the other hand, using a lot of levers in order to offset the overall impact on our expense line and on our margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shlomo Rosenbaum </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then I just want to ask a little bit more about trying to figure out how far we are from the bottom, just in terms of the Ratings revenue. Doug, you talked about refunding laws becoming more meaningful in the middle of next year. if you take the revenue that you would expect from those refunding walls together with your subscription revenue, that you\\'re getting, say, this year. How far away are you from, let\\'s say, 2022 revenue that you\\'re expecting? In other words, how much further downward you really have to go just to kind of hit that number?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Shlomo, we\\'re not really trying to call a bottom or a top to the market. We are also not providing any guidance or outlook for 2023 at this time. As I mentioned, we\\'ve been very engaged with the markets with issuers and investors. We\\'re also -- we have world-class economists and experts that are providing us with input. So we\\'re looking at all of that, what you just discussed, but we\\'re -- there\\'s no -- we have no ability to actually call a bottom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will now take our final question from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Steinerman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Referring to Slide 38, I just wanted to talk about implied Rating margins for the fourth quarter. To get to that mid-50s rating margin for the full year, my math says it\\'s about 49% Ratings margins for the fourth quarter. Ewout, if you could just please confirm that? And then just help us appreciate the 49% because that\\'s a notable step down from third quarter Ratings margins. Please comment about seasonality or any other factors we would need to understand fourth quarter Ratings margins on Slide 38.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Andrew, as you understand, we\\'re not giving quarterly guidance, so I can\\'t give you numbers by quarter by segment margins. But what we are, of course, trying to do is if we give you a full year picture, we give you a full year outlook, then of course you can backwards calculate what is the expectation for the quarter itself. I do want to point out that the third quarter in general is the lowest quarter for us from an expense perspective. That is due to seasonality. The fourth quarter is higher. But you have seen that in previous years as well. So from a trend perspective, there\\'s nothing different than what you -- that you should have seen in the past. But sequentially, you should expect expenses to roll out. Again, that is normal seasonality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Douglas Peterson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, that was the last question. So I\\'d like to make a quick closing comment. So first of all, thank you, everyone, for joining the call today for your questions and your support. But I\\'m really pleased with the progress we\\'ve made since closing the merger. It\\'s only been 8 months. And we\\'ve been able to unify our management team under a strong vision and set of purposes and values. We see strong commercial success. You heard about it on this call, our cross-sell and our product innovation, and we\\'re ahead of schedule to achieve our cost synergies. And all of that in a challenging macroeconomic backdrop where we discuss some of those topics today. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But we also have very important secular trends that are creating opportunities for S&amp;P Global: the energy transition, the continued interest in climate and sustainability, the need for analytics and insights in very turbulent markets. So we\\'re very pleased with our progress, and I\\'m excited that we\\'ll be able to share more with you on our strategic vision and our multiyear targets at our Investor Day on December 1. But let me end by thanking again our people who are absolutely fantastic, they\\'re world-class. And I want to thank all of you again for joining us on this call today. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That concludes this morning\\'s call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in about two hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&amp;P Global\\'s website for one year. The audio-only telephone replay will be maintained for one month.

Doug?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Douglas Peterson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mark. We\\'re pleased to discuss our third quarter results and how we\\'re growing, innovating and executing with discipline even in the face of a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. With each quarter that passes, we see further evidence of the strength of our combined company. While no one could have predicted what this year would have looked like, we have benefited from the diversification of our revenue and profit streams and that ballast has provided great resilience as we continue to navigate choppy waters. .</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\\'s been nearly two years since we announced the merger, and I\\'m proud of the progress we\\'ve made. We continue to put the customer at the core of everything we do and we continue to demonstrate a clear commitment to our people while maintaining a high standard of operational excellence. We have an incredibly bright future, and I\\'m excited to share more with you about our strategic vision at our Investor Day on December 1.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look at our third quarter financial highlights, I want to remind you that the adjusted financial metrics we\\'ll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics in the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period. Revenue decreased 8% year-over-year or 6% ex FX, with growth in four of our six divisions being offset by continued decreases in Ratings, as well as a year-over-year decline in Engineering Solutions this quarter due to the timing impact of a single product that Ewout will discuss later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Recurring revenue increased 2% year-over-year, representing 84% of revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses declined 5% year-over-year as cost synergies and disciplined expense management offset some of the inflationary impact we\\'re seeing in labor and technology. Outside of the Ratings business, we saw an average of approximately 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. We\\'re updating our guidance ranges to reflect continued headwinds in Ratings as well as better-than-expected performance in Indices. Guidance ranges for our other four divisions are unchanged from last quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\\'d also like to share a few other highlights from the third quarter. As I mentioned, we\\'re coming up on two years since the merger was announced and nearly eight months since the close. Our post-merger integration efforts are proceeding on track, but very importantly, we\\'re outperforming on both cost and revenue synergies. Our customer conversations remain encouraging despite the economic environment. We continue to see significant growth in multiple business lines due to secular trends that will likely benefit us for years to come, like energy transition as well as the near-term benefit we see from volatility and the need for insights and analytics in times of turbulence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also remain committed to the capital allocation plan we laid out for you at the time the merger closed. We\\'re on track to deploy the full $12 billion in funds for accelerated share repurchases by year-end. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the commercial success we\\'re seeing in the business. The merger continues to generate encouraging conversations with our customers about the increased value we offer as a combined company. In Market Intelligence, we developed a strong commercial pipeline in September, and we believe we will see a reacceleration of the Desktop business in the fourth quarter. Between Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights, we\\'ve generated well over 3,000 cross-sell referrals since the merger closed, and the conversion rates are strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Despite the issuance environment, our Ratings teams remain highly engaged. We remain connected with investors and issuers to maintain relationships and ensure we have the appropriate understanding of their needs in advance of any recovery in the debt markets. Commodity Insights and Mobility are both seeing significantly improved retention rates relative to recent history as well as strong competitive wins and new customer growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We saw a very important win in our Indices business this quarter as a large Japanese asset manager launched the first cross-asset ETF in Japan based on both iBoxx Fixed Income and S&amp;P Dow Jones Equity Indices. While it\\'s still early in our efforts in cross-asset indices, this launch is powerful proof of the demand for such products among global asset managers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now to recap the financial results for the third quarter. Revenue decreased 8% to $2.86 billion or 6% constant currency. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 12% to $1.3 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 46% as both profits and margin were negatively impacted by the decrease in Ratings transaction revenue, partially offset by cost synergies realized in the quarter. Our non-Ratings businesses in aggregate grew revenue 4% in the quarter compared to prior year. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which was 45.5% as of the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Despite the impact of the issuance environment, we benefited from the resiliency of our businesses as well as disciplined cost management and cost synergies to significantly moderate the impact to our adjusted EPS, which declined only 4% year-over-year. Looking across the six divisions, I\\'m pleased to report positive growth across four of our divisions, with Ratings continuing to work through a difficult issuance cycle and Engineering Solutions entering an off-cycle quarter without the sale of a core product that is released once every two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Throughout the year, we\\'ve seen outsized growth in certain products as customers depend on our data and information to make informed decisions during uncertain times. We saw double-digit revenue growth in multiple product lines as a result. Within our Indices business, revenue from exchange-traded derivatives outperformed our internal expectations, growing nearly 40% year-over-year. Our CDS Indices, which include the CDX and iTraxx index families, increased 66%. Markets continue to recognize our leadership in areas like climate and financial data, and we provide a consolidated platform on which to access information, whether it\\'s tracking market movements, company performance or identifying physical risk from weather events, our customers continue to come to us for help navigating the uncertainty. This is evident in the growth we saw in key product offerings for Market Intelligence, including Trucost and Equities, Data and Analytics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\\'m pleased to mark the first anniversary of the launch of Platts Dimensions Pro, a one-stop experience across Platts benchmark price assessments; news and analytics spanning 13 commodities, including energy transition. Over the last year, we\\'ve continuously increased functionality, introducing new features on a regular basis. This unified platform is gaining clear recognition with active user growth nearly doubling in just the last six months. Moreover, some of our newer benchmarks continue to expand their market presence, our low-sulfur marine fuel assessment is a great indicator of the trajectory of a successful new benchmark. Assessments like this often take multiple years to truly scale and become literal market benchmarks. In the third quarter, approximately 1.3 billion barrels of fuel were traded based on price assessment, representing a 15% increase compared to last year. Our iron ore assessment has been the primary physical market pricing reference for seaborne fine iron ore delivered to China for over 10 years, and it\\'s still growing at an impressive rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We understand the importance of reliable market benchmarks to the secular energy transition story, and we\\'re positioning ourselves for long-term success. The chart on the right shows the cumulative number of new assessments we have launched and energy transition over the last two years. These include a new suite of Australian hydrogen prices covering one of the key producers of this future fuel as well as the Methane Performance Certificate that we believe will be an integral component of low-carbon crude trading.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to issuance. During the third quarter, global-rated issuance decreased 40% year-over-year; in the U.S., rated issuance in aggregate decreased 47%; European-rated issuance decreased 19%; and in Asia, rated issuance declined 47%. High yield was down by 80% year-over-year in both United States and Europe and was down nearly 100% in Asia. Structured finance in Europe was the only positive regional category in the quarter, increasing 7% year-over-year. We\\'ve included additional details on the subcomponents of issuance by region in the slide deck. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to make significant progress in our sustainability products. ESG revenue increased nearly 40% year-over-year to nearly $50 million in the quarter. We saw continued innovation in our ESG indices and the market recognition of our strength.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We launched the S&amp;P Net Zero 2050 Carbon Budget Indices, and we ended the quarter with ESG ETF AUM of $35 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year in a down market. Within Market Intelligence, we launched enhanced Physical Risk Exposure Scores and Financial Impact data sets to support clients as they seek to understand and manage the physical and financial exposure to climate change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Ratings division continues to see success here as well, completing 13 ESG evaluations and 23 Sustainable Financing Opinions in the quarter. One of the most important competitive advantages in our ESG efforts is the Corporate Sustainability Assessment, which is an annual comprehensive assessment completed in partnership with participating companies. The S&amp;P Global brand and everything it stands for continues to drive growth in the number of companies seeking to partner with us in this assessment process. Year-to-date, we\\'ve seen more than 2,300 companies opt in, a more than 25% increase from the same time last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. Beginning with our issuance forecast. Our Ratings research team is expecting an approximately 19% decline in global market issuance, including both rated and unrated issuance for the full year. This compares to the previous forecast of down 16%. Importantly, our financial results and guidance are more closely tied to billed issuance, which can differ materially from market issuance as we described last quarter. Year-to-date, market issuances declined approximately 14%, while billed issuances declined approximately 42%. Based on the trends we saw in September and October, we now expect billed issuance to be down approximately 45% to 50% for the full year. When we look to the broader macroeconomic environment for the rest of 2022, we continue to see further deterioration from what we expected in August. In addition to the downward trend in issuance, our expectations for GDP growth, inflation and the commodities markets have all lowered.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With only two months left in 2022, we wanted to provide what will likely be the final update on some of the macroeconomic indicators we\\'re using to help inform our financial guidance for the year. We\\'ll not be discussing our expectations for 2023 on this call, but we will be closely monitoring both the internal and external indicators of our business over the coming months. And we\\'ll plan to provide our initial 2023 outlook at the customary time when we report our fourth quarter results early next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before I turn the call over to Ewout, I want to thank the incredible people we have at S&amp;P Global. Our people have executed well in a challenging environment this year and have delivered great value for our customers and the organization while managing a complex integration. I\\'m confident that we\\'re well positioned to drive long-term growth and create long-term value for our shareholders. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\\'ll turn the call over to Ewout to walk through financials and guidance. Ewout?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ewout Steenbergen</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Doug. Doug has already discussed the headline financial results, and I would like to cover a few other items. As Doug mentioned, the adjusted financial metrics we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from divested businesses in all periods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adjusted corporate unallocated expenses improved from a year ago, driven by a combination of synergies and reduced incentive costs. Our net interest expense decreased 17% as we benefit from lower average rates due to refinancings following the merger. Adjusted effective tax rate was up modestly, but towards the low end of the guidance range we expect for the full year. As most are aware, we exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the third quarter were approximately $108 million in merger-related expenses. The details of which can be found in the appendix.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, of $965 million. We remain committed to returning the majority of this cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have deployed $11 billion towards share repurchases, and we expect the final $1 billion of our previously announced ASR program to be completed by year-end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We note that the U.S. dollar remained strong against many foreign currencies, and we\\'ve seen a corresponding impact on both our revenue and expenses. As a reminder, approximately 3/4 of our international revenue is invoiced in U.S. dollars, which provides some protection to revenue against FX volatility. In addition to the natural hedges that exist due to the global footprint of our people, we have a hedging program in place that further mitigates the ultimate impact on our earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the third quarter, we saw a $0.03 favorable impact to EPS from foreign exchange and hedging programs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to expenses. We are committed to disciplined expense management in this current environment. And similar to last quarter, we highlight the levers we continue to pull to protect margins where we can while still preserving our investments to drive future growth. Actions taken include pull forward in synergies, a reduction in incentive accruals, adjustments to the timing of certain investments and pausing select hiring and limiting consulting spend in some areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Through cost synergies and other management actions we have taken so far this year, we expect to generate more than $400 million in expense savings for 2022. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the third quarter, we achieved $165 million in cumulative cost synergies and our current annualized run rate is $311 million. I\\'m pleased to report we continue to outperform our initial time line on both revenue and cost synergies year-to-date. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the third quarter is $641 million. Given the outperformance on the timing of our synergies, we now expect to achieve slightly more than the 35% to 40% of total cost synergies in 2022 that we were targeting previously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\\'s turn to the division results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence revenue increased 4% with strong growth in Data and Analytics, offset by slower growth in Desktop and flat growth in Enterprise Solutions. For this quarter, recurring revenue accounted for approximately 96% of Market Intelligence total revenue. Expenses were roughly flat this quarter with increases in compensation expense, cloud spend and outside services being offset by cost synergies and lower incentive compensation. Market Intelligence remains the biggest driver of cost synergies from the merger and the synergy outperformance we have seen year-to-date.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Segment operating profit increased 13%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 260 basis points to 33.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 30.9%. The OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division contributed $19 million in adjusted operating profit to the company. As a reminder, because the JV is a 50% owned joint venture operating independent of the company, we recognize their results on an after-tax basis and do not include the financial results of OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking across Market Intelligence, there was growth in most categories. And on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 3%, Data &amp; Advisory Solutions revenue grew 7%, Enterprise Solutions revenue was flat and Credit &amp; Risk Solutions revenue grew 7%. For Desktop, we saw slower growth this quarter, driven in part by the timing of certain revenue recognition items, and we expect desktop to reaccelerate in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For Enterprise Solutions, the business line continues to see headwinds in several of our volume-driven products that rely on equity and debt capital markets activity under variable subscription terms. Excluding the impact of FX and these volume-driven products, growth across Market Intelligence would have been approximately 7% year-over-year. While we remain confident in the long-term growth of all these product lines, we expect deceleration in categories outside of Desktop to persist in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to Ratings. Ratings continued to face difficult market conditions this quarter as issuance volumes remained muted with revenue decreasing 33% year-over-year. Transaction revenue decreased to 56% on the continued softness in issuance we highlighted earlier. Non-transaction revenue decreased 6% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower Rating Evaluation Services and initial Issuer Credit Ratings, partially offset by increases in CRISIL, ICR and RES revenue are historically correlated with the relative strength of the issuance environment and M&amp;A activity, respectively, and the declines we are seeing here are purely indicative of those market conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Expenses decreased 19%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management, including lower incentive expenses, partially offset by increased salary and fringe expenses. This resulted in a 41% decrease in segment operating profit and a 750 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin to 55.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 57.9%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now looking at Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in Ratings revenue were a 44% decrease in Corporates and a 31% decrease in Structured Finance, driven predominantly by structured credit. In addition, Financial Services decreased 20%, Governments decreased 33%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 9%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And now turning to Commodity Insights, revenue increased 5%, driven by strong performance of subscription products, including those within Price Assessments and Energy &amp; Resources, Data &amp; Insights lines. However, that growth was impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As noted on the slide, revenue related to Russia contributed $12 million in the third quarter last year and made no contribution in the third quarter this year. Excluding this impact, Commodity Insights would have grown approximately 8% in the third quarter. There\\'s no change to the expected impact from this conflict. But as a reminder, on an annualized run rate basis, we expect Commodity Insights revenue and operating income to be lower by approximately $52 million and $51 million, respectively. For this quarter, recurring revenue contributed 91% of Commodity Insights revenues. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Expenses increased 1%, primarily due to salary and fringe and an increase in T&amp;E expense partially offset by merger-related synergies, lower consulting spend and lower real estate costs. Segment operating profit increased 9%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 45.8%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 43.8%. Looking across the Commodity Insights business categories, price assessments grew 8% compared to the prior year, driven by continued commercial momentum and strong subscription growth for market data offerings. Energy &amp; Resources, Data &amp; Insights also grew 8% in the quarter, driven by strength in gas, power and renewables and in petrochemicals. Advisory and Transactional Services decreased 1% in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Upstream business was down 2% compared to prior year, mainly driven by higher comps for Software and Analytics products offerings as well as the impact of Russia. Excluding that impact and the impact of FX, Upstream ACV growth would have been positive in the quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our Mobility division, revenue increased 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued high retention rates and new business growth in CARFAX. For this quarter, recurring revenue contributed 78% of Mobility\\'s total revenue. Expenses grew 5% year-over-year as we have yet to lap planned increases in headcounts, and we saw continued cloud expense growth, which were partially offset by lower data cost and favorable FX. This resulted in a 14% growth in adjusted operating profit and 200 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 40%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for CARFAX as dealerships profitability remain at elevated levels. Manufacturing grew 4% year-over-year, driven by strength in subscriptions and an uptick in the Recall business. Inventory shortfalls continue to temper growth as OEMs spend on marketing initiatives powered by Mobility products remains muted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Financials and other increased 9%, primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting products and new business. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices revenue increased 3% year-over-year with strong margin expansion despite lower assets under management. For the third quarter, recurring revenue contributed 84% of the total for indices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, expenses were roughly flat as strategic investments and higher information services costs were offset primarily by lower incentives and other expenses. Segment operating profit increased 5%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 70.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 68.8%. Asset-linked fees were down 5%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs. Exchange-rated derivative revenue increased 37% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including a more than 60% increase in S&amp;P 500 Index options volume. Data &amp; Custom Subscriptions increased 10%, driven by new business activities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the past year, market depreciation totaled $472 billion. ETF AUM net inflows were $194 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.3 trillion, which is an 11% decrease compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which decreased 4% year-over-year. As a reminder, revenue tends to lag changes in asset prices. Given the declines across equity markets so far in the back half of this year, we continue to expect softness in asset-linked fees as we close out 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Engineering Solutions revenue declined 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by the negative impact of the timing of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. The BPVC contributed approximately $1 million in revenue this quarter compared to approximately $8 million in the year ago period. For this quarter, 94% of Engineering Solutions revenues were classified as recurring. Adjusted expenses decreased 7% due to favorable impact on BPVC royalties. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 19.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Non-subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions decreased 63% year-over-year for the reasons I mentioned on the previous slide, while subscription revenue increased 3% over the same period. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now moving to our guidance. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. And this slide depicts our updated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance due to the continued softening of the issuance environment, we now expect revenue to decrease mid-single digits compared to our prior guidance. Some of that impact is offset by the outperformance in indices. The net impact of our lower ratings revenue expectations, combined with the cost measures and capital allocation measures we have outlined today result in our slightly lower margin outlook and a new adjusted EPS range of $11 to $11.15. This margin outlook reflects our continued expectation for approximately 180 basis points of margin expansion outside of our Ratings business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Interest expense is expected in the range of $345 million to $355 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance due to higher interest on our cash deposits and positive impact from currency hedges. We\\'re also reducing our outlook for capital expenditures to $115 million due to intentional delays in real estate investments. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, is now expected to be approximately $4 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The following slide illustrates our guidance by division. Based on this past quarter\\'s performance, we\\'re updating our expectations for adjusted revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin for Ratings and Indices. The guidance ranges for our other divisions are unchanged. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, despite the geopolitical tensions and a challenging macroeconomic environment weighing on the markets, our portfolio of strong businesses continue to prove resilient. Furthermore, I\\'m pleased with the progress our teams have made since the closing of the merger earlier this year. We look forward to providing you with a deep dive into our businesses and the longer-term outlook of the company at our Investor Day on December 1. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Grant</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Ewout. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our first question comes from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Owen Lau</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the MI Credit Risk Solutions and Data &amp; Advisory Solutions, could you please unpack a little bit on the products and services driving that growth in current backdrop? Are they new customers? Because based on my understanding, many of these products are subscription based. I just want to get a better sense of how you can further monetize it and drive that growth?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Owen, this is Doug, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start, first of all, by mentioning that within Market Intelligence, Credit and Risk Solutions has always been a long-term outperformer. It\\'s an area that we see very high demand from the markets for information about credit risk and other types of risk, especially in this market. As you know, the core products in this area are the basic products that are providing information from the Ratings business. So things like RatingsDirect, RatingsXpress. We also have a suite of products like Credit Analytics. And we do see a lot of growth now related to credit climate analytics. This is an area where we\\'re seeing increased interest and demand, especially from financial institutions, especially large global banks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, we\\'re seeing some other growth from areas like traded market risks some names of, I\\'ll say, ex VA, CCR. We have a VAR product, et cetera. And then we have some additional buy-side risk opportunities for clients to look at for market risk and stress scenarios. So if you look at the entire suite of products, we\\'re able to provide the market information at the time when they really want to understand risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Owen Lau</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. That\\'s very helpful. And then my follow-up is somehow related to the Ratings business. Could you please talk about your view on how private credit market might have impacted S&amp;P Global Rating business? And how S&amp;P can provide services in this area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks. On the private markets, as we saw earlier this year, there was a retreat of institutional investors and retail investors from credit funds. So there was really no liquidity at the beginning part of this year. It was a combination of people that were risk averse and also looking at the shift between fixed and floating. There were a lot of moves in interest rates. So we saw a retreat from the traditional loan funds and high-risk investors that left the markets. That left an opportunity for the private credit funds that had traditionally been focusing on mid-market credit. So SME credit was their expertise. Many of them also had started moving into the higher quality, higher level of risk and large-cap companies. So they were there to fill the gap. The gap was filled by private credit at the beginning of the year. And we know that they\\'ve also been able to take on loans with a faster, also with a higher risk level. And so we\\'ve seen that increase during the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now how do we think about that? First of all, we look at that as an opportunity for us going forward. We believe that the private credit funds will be looking over time to have some sort of risk transformation, whether it\\'s related to fixed floating or it has to do with securitization or syndication. We think at that time, they\\'re going to be wanting some Estimate services, potentially Rating services. In addition, we\\'ve identified private credit as one of our most important strategic growth drivers. We already have a base of private credit businesses that were part of IHS Markit. And related to that, we have a strong starting point with products like iLEVEL provides information to portfolio managers. So we\\'ve identified private credit is a growth area for us for ratings as well as for Market Intelligence going forward. And we\\'re watching the trend very carefully. We know at some point, investors will come back to the markets, and we\\'ll see a broadening of the market again. But we\\'ve been watching this very closely and are actually interested in this as a growth area for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ashish Sabadra </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to drill down further on the Ratings and the issuance guidance. I believe my back of math -- envelope math suggests that you\\'re assuming a similar growth in fourth quarter as third quarter for transaction revenues. I just wanted to see if I\\'m in the right ballpark I was just wondering if you could provide any color on what your expectations are for issuance for the rest of the year. Are you assuming any rebound? And how are the conversations with the issuers coming along?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ashish, if you look at the outlook, as you know, we are not really providing quarterly guidance. So we\\'re not really speaking about the quarterly outlook for either our financial results or some of the input variables like issuance. But of course, if you look at the numbers that we put out today, then if you would do a backward calculation, you would assume that the most recent trends we are seeing in terms of issuance is what we expect to continue also in the fourth quarter. So, definitely, that’s the main reason why we took our guidance down. I would say that\\'s the only reason, because overall the impact on our results from a top line perspective is about $200 million reduction in revenue outlook for the Ratings business, so about $0.50 of EPS. And then there were a couple of smaller things. But net-net, I think that\\'s the main driver of why the EPS outlook is down for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ashish Sabadra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\\'s very helpful color. And maybe just switching gears on Mobility, pretty strong momentum there despite what we are seeing in the auto lending space or in the auto space. And so I was just wondering, as we start to see the demand for auto slow down, how should we think about the growth in the business? Is there some counter-cyclicality as well here in the business?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Ashish, thank you for your questions. When it comes to Mobility, we see that there\\'s a very interesting shift going on over the last couple of years. As you know, when the market started slowing down from the pandemic and the supply chain interruptions, we saw the used auto market really start expanding and we benefited from the CARFAX products and the CARFAX suite of products, especially at the dealer level. We know that there\\'s some counter-cyclicality as you say, it as the market returns to new autos coming into the market and inventories rise that we will benefit from products and services to the OEMs and as well as the dealers are going to start having a different type of relationship again with the manufacturers and suppliers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\\'re watching right now very closely three big trends in the automotive market: what\\'s happening with the used car market where we have a strong position, what\\'s happening with the OEMs and the supply chain for the new automobiles. They\\'ve been in historic lows over the last two years. So we expect that\\'s going to start going up. And then there\\'s also a transformation taking place in the industry as more and more vehicles start to become electric based with the drivetrain as opposed to internal combustion. So a lot of trends, which are all play to our advantage because we have data analytics and research products that we can serve all of the users in these markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Kramm</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I understand that you don\\'t really want to comment much on 2023 quite yet, I guess, we\\'ll wait until December. Just on the issuance side, however, your own research group yesterday put out not only the 2022 update but also the 2023 initial look, which I think calls, if I got this right, for 2% issuance growth and 10% growth, in particular, for the Corporate side, which I think is the most important for you. So since this is out there, I\\'m just wondering how we should be thinking about that forecast? And what\\'s kind of items you would think about as you think about how that flows into billed issuance and revenues? I know it\\'s early, but given that your own company has an issue outlook out there already, figured it\\'s relevant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, Alex. As you say, we produce a report. And what we\\'re looking at right now is, understanding what are going to be the main factors driving us towards the end of the year. We\\'ve given you those in that report as well. That showed that issuance was expected to be down by 19% for the full year, which compared to 16% from our last report. As you know, we will wait to provide guidance for 2023 until February when we provide our full issuance report as well as our guidance for the year. What you saw from the report from our team, our credit research team is product research and it\\'s not necessarily geared directly to how we\\'re going to find billed issuance. As you recall, last quarter, we explained very clearly what is included in billed issuance. We take the -- what would be expectations for issuance overall. We add in leveraged loans. And then we extract some debt areas like unrated categories such as MTNs, most of the domestic debt from China. And we also exclude the international public finance from those calculations to come up with our expectations. But maybe more importantly to your question, we\\'re always in the market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you saw, we talked about having had 3,000 interactions with the markets during the quarter. We are all over the market to understand what are the factors that are going on that are driving issuance and will drive issuance. So we do provide our guidance going forward. But we\\'re looking at the issuance forecast, GDP growth, macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rates. We\\'re looking at spreads, which have been quite high over the last few quarters. Maturity schedules, which are quite encouraging going forward into 2023, \\'24, \\'25, et cetera, M&amp;A pipeline. So as you know, at the time we come out with our guidance, we will have looked at all of these factors. But maybe the most important point is that we\\'re not just standing around and waiting. We\\'re very actively engaged with the markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Kramm</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Fair enough. Then maybe just going to Market Intelligence. I think since the deal was announced or closed, I think we have had this expectation that more and more of the, I guess, subscriptions on the IHS Markit side will be moving onto our S&amp;P kind of enterprise umbrella. So just wondering if that\\'s still true, if there\\'s a time line for moving more and more that legacy market subscription under that S&amp;P umbrella. And yes, how far we\\'re along if you\\'re able to pick up any sort of incremental pricing as you do that? Or how should we think about that transition over time, if that is a plan?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Alex, it\\'s very, very early for us to talk about it. But what I\\'ll tell you is going back to the last comment I made that we\\'re incredibly linked into the markets right now. We have all of our commercial teams are out speaking with our customers. What we\\'re finding is that there\\'s a lot of opportunities for us to start with cross-sell. So our initial early wins have been with cross-sell, selling different products within the divisions and sometimes across the divisions. But we are hearing opportunities for moving data into the Desktop, finding some products for data and research and analytics fit together. So to your point, it\\'s a vision that we have, but it\\'s really early for us to give you any kind of detailed analytics about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Kaplan </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to ask about Ratings margins. They were down sequentially, but they were still really resilient just given the environment and especially relative to one of your big competitors. Just wanted to ask you if you could talk about some drivers that enabled you to flex cost outside of incentive comp?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Toni, you\\'re right. We are quite pleased with the overall expense discipline of the company in the third quarter. You\\'ve heard us announce last quarter that we\\'re taking additional actions to deal with the macro environment and we\\'re actually really pleased how that is playing out, and you may continue to see that kind of a result from us going forward across the company. And of course, we take the benefit also from the cost synergies that we can implement and accelerate during this period. So if you look specifically at the Ratings business, it is a mix. On the one hand, we continue to make sure that we invest in future growth, making sure that we stay competitive on a compensation perspective. We want to preserve the capacity we have on the analytical side. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But on the other hand, there are also discretionary costs that we are bringing down. There are allocated costs that are benefiting from the synergies that we are realizing across the company, and then also incentive compensation is down year-over-year. So it\\'s actually a balance of different elements that go into the mix. But definitely, as you have seen in the past, we\\'re always focused in terms of trying to preserve margins in our business businesses as much as possible, particularly in more challenging macro environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Kaplan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And this is a little bit of a broad question and you could take it where you want. But just -- could you talk about any changes in customer behavior over the last six months, and this could be elongation of the sales cycle in some places? Or maybe it\\'s just different products that have been more in demand? Just wanted to get a sense of sort of changes in the businesses over the last recent history?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Toni, thanks for that question. And as you know, the markets are going through a lot of uncertainty and turmoil. We\\'ve never lived through a period where you have an end of a pandemic, a war, inflation, interest rates going up, all sorts of different impacts. I mentioned earlier on the mobility discussion what kind of impact that\\'s had on the markets overall. We\\'ve seen this interest in talking about risk. It\\'s a topic which has increased dramatically. When we meet with customers, they want to talk about the external environment. They want the expertise of S&amp;P Global that comes from our entire company to understand what\\'s happening with risk, with markets, with credit as well as equities, commodities. So we start with very broad dialogues. And then we dig deeper into some specific topics. One that comes up in almost every single conversation we have is energy transition, climate and sustainability. That\\'s a really common discussion. It\\'s increasing in terms of how much time we spend on it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And another one is Data and Analytics. How are customers thinking about their own application of AI, Data and Analytics? They want to learn from us how we\\'re managing S&amp;P Global, but they also want to learn how they can be deploying new types of products and services using more AI. But overall, we have not seen any kind of initial pushback on slowing down a sales cycle. Clearly, there are some markets, as I mentioned, the ratings market, there\\'s not a lot of issuance right now, but we\\'ve stayed engaged with the market. But maybe net-net, the big topics we spent a lot of time on the macroeconomic environment, sustainability as well as AI and data. Those are big conversations we have in almost every customer interaction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Silber </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to start with a Ratings-related question. I asked your competitor -- your large competitor the same question. I\\'m just wondering like your thoughts. What are you looking for in terms of signs of an uptick in that market, green shoots, et cetera? What should we be focusing on?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\\'s a few things that I\\'m focusing on myself, and I know that if we had our Ratings team specifically on the call, they might tell me that there\\'s others that are looking at beyond that. But clearly, there\\'s a set of factors, M&amp;A activity is one for me, which is -- it\\'s kind of an informal indicator. M&amp;A activity has been quite weak recently. Typical M&amp;A has a set of transactions come along with it, may be a bridge loan, which turns into a deal loan, which turns into a bond or rated loan, et cetera. M&amp;A activity has been weak. IPOs is another one. The reason I look at those myself is that those are just their activity, which denotes confidence in the markets that people are willing to invest. But then as you recall, we\\'re having conversations with issuers. We mentioned 3,000 that we had last quarter with issuers. And we see a lot of interest in investing people that have plans for investing in new markets for innovation, for investing in venture capital, ways that they can see new shoots in their own businesses. So we\\'re watching when is it that people actually pull the trigger. And maybe the takeaway is it\\'s not, if it\\'s when. We know that there\\'s a lot of people out there that are ready to go. They have great ideas, but the question is when will those conditions of interest rates, of stability of market confidence, when will those be back when people start going back to the market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, we do look at the maturity schedules, and we know that there\\'s a point starting towards the middle of next year that there will be maturity schedules are going to start kicking in and we\\'re going to watch that carefully as well. We\\'ll there be pull forward from that, but that\\'s another factor we\\'re going to be watching.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Silber </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That\\'s really helpful. And I can shift over to the Mobility line of business. Margins, at least by our record, looks like it hit an all-time high, even I think compared to IHS\\'s business, and I know it\\'s a different segment right now. But can you talk about what\\'s going on there? And should we expect margins to continue to go higher from here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jeff, we are always aspiring to improve margins across all of our businesses. So mobility is not an exception to that. That is because of the fact that we\\'re focused on operating leverage. We always like to see the top line growing faster than the expense line. And of course, aided then by strategic investments to aim for future growth as well. What we are seeing in the mobility business is really a positive overall environment that helps and is very supportive for the business, particularly with low inventory levels, we see margins high for the OEMs and for the dealers and that is driving high retention rates. The offset of that is that we see lower spend for sales and marketing products that we are having, and that\\'s because of the same factor that the inventory levels are low. So you could say there\\'s a kind of an inherent hedge in that business. If the market starts to turn, if we see that the demand supply starts to shift in the car market, then we would also see those different revenue streams moving in opposite directions. But we think that with that, we\\'re insulated from our overall financial impact, and therefore, we can continue to focus on margin expansion as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as Doug mentioned before, we also are taking a benefit from used car markets, and that has been proven to be quite resilient the cycle. So yes, overall, we are really happy with the growth of mobility, the margins, and we would see that continuing going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">George Tong</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Billed issuance was down 40% in the third quarter. You\\'re assuming full year billed issuance declines of 45% to 50% will be worse than the third quarter decline. What are you seeing that suggests 4Q could potentially be worse than 3Q in terms of billed issuance? Any color there would be helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. First of all, let me just give a little bit more color on that. As you know, at the last forecast, we saw that issuance of the non-financials or Corporates would be down about 30%. We now see it down about 35%. And then we see that in Financial Services, they had expected to be down 10%, now down about 14% or so. When you look at the total billed issuance, and we mentioned that it was going to -- year-to-date was down 42% and we\\'re expecting it to be down now 45%, this is going to be based on what we see in the pipeline. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I mentioned in the answer I gave a few minutes ago, we see that the market itself is quite hesitant. It\\'s not a question of, if, it\\'s a question of when. And we see that during the fourth quarter, what we\\'ve picked up from investment banks from issuers directly that right now, they\\'re still waiting to see what the conditions are going to be around economic growth, interest rates and spreads. So it\\'s just based on our forecast, not our issuance forecast. This is based on our market forecast based on people that are meeting with issuers and meeting with investors that the current conditions are still such that people are holding back before they go to market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">George Tong</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Very helpful. And related to that, we\\'re likely going to be in a higher interest rate environment for some time relative to pre-COVID. What are your thoughts on whether corporates may enter a phase of balance sheet delevering and implications for issuance performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, that\\'s a theoretical question, but let me go back and look at history. I know that many of us have been in the market for many years, remember when interest rates were 4%; 3%, 4%, 5% base rates and the markets were incredibly active. I think that we\\'ll settle into a range once there\\'s stability and we understand what the longer-term rates are going to be, what longer-term inflation and growth are going to be. Companies and financial institutions will go back to the markets because they want to invest and grow. We know that organizations like to grow and to grow, you deploy capital. We also look at the trend around the globe where more and more markets are shifting from being banking markets to capital markets. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right now, in Europe, there\\'s a couple of shifts going on in the support programs that the ECB was providing to the banks. This was very easy, very low-cost funding. They\\'re starting to wean the banks off of those, and they\\'re going to the capital markets to raise more capital as well as to deploy more capital into bonds instead of into loans. So we see this trend of capital marketization around the globe, and we think that\\'s another trend in the long run that will drive a lot of positive tailwinds for the Ratings business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Craig Huber </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My first question on pricing, can you just update us on a like-for-like basis? What would you say the average price increase is this year? And how does it vary across the segments? Is it 3% to 4%? Or is a little bit higher?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Greg. Well, we are always very careful when we speak about pricing in isolation because, first and foremost, we start with customer value. What do we deliver for our customers? And the good news is that based on the very high value of our products and services, we should be able to pass on cost/price increases and to achieve more favorable contract terms and fees over time at renewal. Of course, it depends on facts and circumstances of each and every product, each and every customer situation and of the situation of each and every of our businesses. But that is our overall philosophy. I can\\'t give you specifically a number for across the company, how much price increases are up compared to previous periods, but there are definitely areas where we are looking at price increases or have already implemented price increases that have been higher than in the past. But again, that all has started with that there is a good balance with the overall customer value that we are delivering.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Craig Huber </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My second question, please, on Market Intelligence. Can you just talk a little further about the health of your clients, the sales pipeline there a little bit further? I mean your numbers speak for themselves. How do you feel about the outlook for Market Intelligence right now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We still feel very, very positive, and we\\'re optimistic about the Market Intelligence pipeline. You read every one so about some of the financial institutions here and there that might be slowing down some of their growth, but we\\'re not seeing that in terms of negotiations with clients. But very importantly, one of the propositions of the merger between IHS Markit and S&amp;P Global was to cross-sell the excellent products from both groups to the client bases on the other. We believe that we have a strong diversification of our client base. And as an example, in the IHS Markit businesses, their financial services business was mostly focused on financial services. We\\'re finding that a lot of the opportunities and a lot of our initial cross-sell has been selling IHS Markit products to corporate clients. We think that there is a lot of upside and a lot of opportunity. We are out in the market actively talking with our customers about ways we can bring value through new products, new services through data, et cetera. So right now, we\\'re not seeing any pullback or any kind of major slowdown of our sales activities or pushback from clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Manav Patnaik</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe just specific to Market Intelligence and the Desktop side. Can you just help us understand the accounting issue, I guess, that will help reaccelerate the growth? And then just thinking out a little bit longer in there, how do you expect the trajectory of the growth there to play? Because I mean, similar to yourselves, I imagine the sell side and other customers will be tightening budgets as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Manav. We recognized that the third quarter revenue growth of the Desktop was below our normal growth potential. But you have to look at it from a particular perspective that there is always some timing of revenue recognition of certain contracts. That was particularly impacting this quarter, but we expect the Desktop growth to normalize again in the fourth quarter. Also for Market Intelligence, in general, if you take out the volume effect of the capital markets business, and also FX, then the overall growth for the full quarter was north of 7%, and we believe that\\'s more indicative of the normal growth opportunity for Market Intelligence as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Manav Patnaik </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Got it. And then can I just ask on the non-transaction side of the Ratings business? It\\'s obviously down 2%, I think you said ex FX. But how long will that keep, I guess, slowly declining? Like when do we lap the Ratings evaluation services, tough comps or whatever it is that\\'s driving that down?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, Manav, that is directly correlated with the overall economic environment, capital markets activity, debt issuance, M&amp;A environment. And we have, of course, seen that the beginning of this year was still relatively strong, and it started to deteriorate somewhere from March onwards. Non-transaction revenue is usually quite stable as a revenue stream. We have two particular areas that are mostly sensitive for the more general macro environment. This is initial credit ratings. We don\\'t see a lot of new issuers coming to the market. And then rating evaluation services, this has a correlation with the M&amp;A market. These are issuers that are thinking about IPOs, spin-offs and so on, want to have some kind of an insight in terms of implications for their ratings. So obviously, those are revenue streams that will come back once the markets start to turn. The more stable elements in non-transaction are around surveillance, around frequent issuer programs. And then most notably, I want to point out that CRISIL is doing very well and is supporting the non-transaction revenue in that category.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Meuler </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I hear you that there\\'s some inherent hedges in the Mobility business, but I think the used car business is a decent amount larger than the new car market for you. So if the market, I guess, shifts back from a mix perspective and some of the profit pools for use target hit, I\\'m just wondering if there\\'s a net benefit or a net detriment to you? And I recognize CARFAX has good structural growth, historically resilient. So could you just give us any more detail on what product lines the competitive wins and new customer growth was coming in or any more detail on CARFAX\\'s innovation that\\'s driving the growth, given that the core report is fairly well penetrated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jeff, you\\'re absolutely right that the used car market is a significant component of the overall revenue stream for the Mobility business. And the good news there is that it has been a very resilient market through the cycles. So we\\'re not overly concerned about if the cycle in the car market start to turn that it will have a material impact. And as I mentioned before, we have other revenue streams actually that we expect to pick up if the equilibrium in the car market start to change, particularly about our sales and marketing products where we have seen relatively lower growth in the more recent past. The mobility business in general is a phenomenal business. There\\'s a lot of innovation, a lot of new product developments, a lot of good support for our customers. CARFAX is really a gem from my perspective in terms of growth and in terms of innovation and new business activity, very close to the customers, a lot of new business launches and new product launches. So I think this business is in a very good position, and we would expect -- also if the car markets start to turn and go in a different direction, that we see continued good performance from this segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Meuler </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then, Doug, you answered the deleveraging question. Can you also give us the historical view of like how much issuance was there in a falling rate environment of bonds being issued that was refinancing debt that wasn\\'t coming due the next, say, three, four years but bonds that had significant duration remaining on them where there was issuance to get the interest expense savings from a falling rate environment. Just I guess on the theoretical that we might not have that type of activity for a while, if you could help me understand roughly if that was meaningful in the past or not?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Basically, this is a question about pull forward. And we saw in 2020 and 2021 during the pandemic, there was what we felt now was structural pull forward. It was a combination of low rates, but probably more importantly, if you are a CFO of any organization, you were not being criticized for having ample liquidity during what people didn\\'t understand was the pandemic as we went into it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we did see a lot of structural pull forward during that period. But historically, I think the treasurers and CFOs of organizations are quite thoughtful and looking at their overall funding strategies. And so the funding is not -- when people look at their balance sheet, it\\'s not only just looking at what they have on what their costs are. But the opportunities that organizations have now are much more complex than they used to be. Securitizations, looking at how they\\'re going to use a maturity transformation, what they do in terms of derivatives. So yes, we do see the balance sheets. We do see that there was pull forward into \\'20 and 2021, but we know the maturities are coming now. And we think that the sort of tools that corporations have to -- and banks have to manage their risk and their liquidity have really changed a lot in the last 10 or 15 years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\\'s hard to go back and compare to history, but we do know what happened in the last few years, where we did see pull forward, but the upcoming maturity schedule, which starts in the second half of 2023 going forward, in a sense it\\'s kind of what was all the issuance that came after the financial crisis, in 2013, \\'14, \\'15. Just think about that huge boom of issuance that took place, that\\'s going to start maturing next year. It was a seven-year, 10-year paper. We see a lot of that will start maturing and that -- we know that, that\\'s going to be in the queue very soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Faiza Alwy </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, I just wanted to ask about the commodity business. You mentioned climate transition. So it sounds like there are some underlying drivers that are sustainable. I\\'m curious if you could talk about the cyclical aspects of the business and maybe areas where you\\'re running into tougher comps. And just how sustainable you think the overall growth rate is there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Let me start with giving you an overall perspective on the Commodity Insights business and how it\\'s doing in the current environment, and then I hand it over to Doug more for the energy transition and climate part. So if you look at the overall macro environment, it\\'s very supportive for the Commodity Insight business at this moment. Definitely, where commodity prices are today is benefiting most of our customers. And therefore, we\\'re seeing also, I would say, based on the very attractive proposition of the combined businesses that we have now brought together under the Commodity Insights segment. We\\'re delivering a lot of new opportunities to our customers. And therefore, we have seen really one of the best sales momentums in this business. If I look at actual sales levels, this will probably one of the very best years for the last maybe a decade or so. So very positive trends that we\\'re seeing that is helping Data &amp; Insights that is helping price assessments. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Global Trading Services business was a little lower this quarter. The main reason there is that we\\'re lapping more difficult comps. But generally, we also see elevated hedging activity on commodity prices, and we\\'re also benefiting from that as well. And then if you look at the upstream business, there, we have seen a turnaround. That was a business that for many years was in a more difficult period. But clearly, our customers are healthier there as well. We see larger CapEx budgets for those customers, and that is helping that business to grow. And we said in our prepared remarks that if you take out the effect of Russia, on a constant currency basis, actually the subscription book of business in the upstream business was growing during the quarter. So overall, very favorable macro environment for Commodity Insights, and that is clearly helping the business this quarter and also in the next couple of quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ewout, I just want to add two points. The first is that all of us know that energy transition is on everyone\\'s mind, whether it\\'s a corporation or government, regulator, financial institution. And as I mentioned earlier, almost every conversation we have talks about this. And where else do you want to go to find about -- learn about energy and energy transition? It\\'s commodity insights of S&amp;P Global. We have the expertise. We have the experts that can talk about current markets, transition markets, and we\\'re finding an incredible amount of engagement. We have conferences. It\\'s one of the areas that Commodity Insights excels at. And we see very high demand for people to participate in those conferences and we\\'re now back in person and the attendance is above the charts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But the second point I want to make is that we\\'re launching new products all the time. Just in the last quarter, we launched some new products that were related to energy transition and new ways to find information about markets. As an example, there\\'s -- in the tanker market, we talked earlier in my -- we had one of our points on our slide showed the low-sulfur fuel oil market, which we -- I remember on an earnings call about three years ago talking about when we launched that and now it\\'s become a benchmark in the market. But in addition, there\\'s things like the carbon accounted tanker rate price assessments, there\\'s interest around the world for understanding freight emissions and what would be under the EU emissions trading system. You\\'re going to need to have much more information for every single tanker and what is its carbon output, and we will have a product for that. As an example, there\\'s a whole information that\\'s needed in Brazil and India and Turkey on energy certificates in emerging markets. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then finally, we have some examples. Recently, as you know, in the United States, there was the new climate bill, which was issued by the United States, by the Congress. And we\\'ve done very special research which is really industry-leading about the clean energy procurement and what that\\'s going to mean for industry. So when it comes to energy and energy transition, we’re the place you want to go.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Faiza Alwy </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. That\\'s all very helpful. Just as a follow-up. Ewout, on Market Intelligence. I think you had you had -- the margin performance was really strong. And I\\'m curious if -- is that the area where you\\'re maybe getting the most synergies? Or just give us a little bit more color on the margin performance, whether it\\'s mix related? And how we should think about that going forward..</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Faiza, yes, we\\'re seeing the largest benefit from cost synergies and revenue synergies in the Market Intelligence division. That\\'s because it\\'s the largest division. It\\'s also the largest combination of different businesses that we\\'re bringing together. And also based on the size of that division, it will also benefit, of course, from a large part of the synergies that we\\'re realizing in the corporate center and the allocation of those costs down to the divisions. What you see is, in general, that we continue to invest in Market Intelligence for future growth. So you see new product launches continuing strategic investments in new areas and initiatives. That was already touching on private credit, private markets, ESG investments we\\'re having there as well. We\\'re having expansion still continuing in China, in the marketplace and many different areas that we are continuing to invest as well as cloud expenses. We\\'re also continuing on our cloud journey and Market Intelligence is continuing to invest there as well. But then the opposite factors, there are some of the expense reductions, the expense discipline and the synergies and the combination of all of that led to the significant margin expansion in Market Intelligence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Hans Hoffman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Stephanie. Could you just comment a bit on what you\\'re seeing across your European revenue base and how that region did relative to your expectations either by segment or overall?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, overall, not so much of a different trend we are seeing in Europe compared to other parts of the world. I understand the background of the question because definitely, the economic outlook in Europe is, of course, quite difficult given the inflation levels, given, of course, the close proximity to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But overall, from a customer dynamics perspective, overall in terms of commercial activity, we\\'re not seeing a significant difference compared to North America or Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Hans Hoffman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. That\\'s helpful. And then just on the revenue synergy side, I guess where have you seen the most success so far and then sort of where do you kind of see the most opportunity?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Most success so far, we see in our largest divisions that we\\'re bringing together, Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights in the Index business. It\\'s mostly cross-sell at this moment, which was as expected because cross sell is the introduction of one product group to existing customers and making sure that we can sell new activities there. For example, in Market Intelligence, we had a nice sale of KYC, KY3P product to an existing customer that was more a customer from the legacy S&amp;P Global side where we could sell a product from the legacy IHS Markit side. So just as an example, so we see -- continue to see good cross-sell. At the same time, we\\'re investing in new product development, in system development that will help them with that growth wave going forward. So it\\'s still early, I have to say around revenue synergies, but we are clearly ahead compared to our original expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Russell Quelch from Redburn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Russell Quelch </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to talk about capital allocation priorities. You still got about $2 billion on cash on the balance sheet and you\\'re on course to generate around $5 billion of free cash flow in \\'23, I believe consensus. Just wondered where you look to do further M&amp;A? Or do you have enough integrations on your hand such that you can look to return perhaps north of 100% of free cash flow again in \\'23?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, no change with respect to our capital philosophy, capital management targets. We think consistency and reliability there is the most important, particularly in this environment. You have seen us continuing with the $12 billion ASR, even despite that we have seen some impact of the current environment on the rating issuance levels we are able to execute on our plans this year. And you may expect the same from us over the next couple of years. So at least 85% of return of capital to our shareholders, a combination of dividends and share buybacks, dividend payout ratio between 20% and 30%. And M&amp;A, the focus is really on small tuck-in and bolt-on, where we see that we can add a nice capability to some of our core strategic focus areas, but nothing large because we first, of course, need to focus on the integration of the large merger and organically building out our businesses. So no changes at all, and we think that is actually the right approach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Russell Quelch </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just one housekeeping question, I guess. Given the earlier comment on being able to achieve the lower-than-average rates due to the refinancing of the IHS debt, what\\'s the level of interest that was delivered in Q3, now the right quarterly rate to assume going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. This is the new run rate with respect to the interest expense on our debt. We were very fortunate with hindsight that we refinanced a large part of the debt at the beginning of March when the 10-year U.S. Treasury was around 1.73 at that point in time. So we are very happy that we locked ourselves in with long-term debt at very low levels. And actually, if you look at the average cost of debt for any player in our industry, we\\'re at one of the lowest levels. So yes, this is the normalized level. If you look, though, at the interest expense line, there\\'s one point that I want to make, it\\'s a net number. So we\\'re generating more interest income on our cash balances. So that is helping us a little bit and obviously, that might fluctuate over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shlomo Rosenbaum </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ewout, I just wanted to ask you a little bit about your labor cost trends. Obviously, it\\'s a significant component of costs. Everyone in the industry has been dealing with the rising labor costs given what\\'s going on in the market. What\\'s your outlook for that? And do you see that kind of letting up in terms of just how we should think about the costs of the business on a go-forward basis, let\\'s say, over the next six to 12 months?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Shlomo, obviously, we are exposed as everyone else, to increases from an overall labor market perspective and comp expectations, and we need to stay competitive in order to attract and retain the best talent. So let me expand a little bit on that answer. So about 60% of our overall expense base is people cost. And obviously, we have people across the whole world in many different job groups and categories. It\\'s not a one-size-fits-all. We see more competitive situations in certain markets and jurisdictions. We see it more in certain job groups. And we are continuously making sure that we stay competitive from an overall comp perspective. And we will continue to do that. So we\\'re definitely expecting to see also some of the changes over the next period flowing through our P&amp;L. But at the same time, we are also taking advantage of a lot of levers that we are having and maybe levers that are given to us through the merger. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have, of course, the opportunity to realize cost synergies and reduction of headcount is an element to that. So that goes in an opposite direction as well as synergies, cost synergies around real estate, around procurement. And then as you see this year, given the performance of the company, also incentive compensation costs are down and we gave you the overall impact of around $120 million to $140 million. So it is a bit of a mix. On the one hand, staying competitive from a labor market perspective; but on the other hand, using a lot of levers in order to offset the overall impact on our expense line and on our margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Shlomo Rosenbaum </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then I just want to ask a little bit more about trying to figure out how far we are from the bottom, just in terms of the Ratings revenue. Doug, you talked about refunding laws becoming more meaningful in the middle of next year. if you take the revenue that you would expect from those refunding walls together with your subscription revenue, that you\\'re getting, say, this year. How far away are you from, let\\'s say, 2022 revenue that you\\'re expecting? In other words, how much further downward you really have to go just to kind of hit that number?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Douglas Peterson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Shlomo, we\\'re not really trying to call a bottom or a top to the market. We are also not providing any guidance or outlook for 2023 at this time. As I mentioned, we\\'ve been very engaged with the markets with issuers and investors. We\\'re also -- we have world-class economists and experts that are providing us with input. So we\\'re looking at all of that, what you just discussed, but we\\'re -- there\\'s no -- we have no ability to actually call a bottom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will now take our final question from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Steinerman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Referring to Slide 38, I just wanted to talk about implied Rating margins for the fourth quarter. To get to that mid-50s rating margin for the full year, my math says it\\'s about 49% Ratings margins for the fourth quarter. Ewout, if you could just please confirm that? And then just help us appreciate the 49% because that\\'s a notable step down from third quarter Ratings margins. Please comment about seasonality or any other factors we would need to understand fourth quarter Ratings margins on Slide 38.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ewout Steenbergen </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Andrew, as you understand, we\\'re not giving quarterly guidance, so I can\\'t give you numbers by quarter by segment margins. But what we are, of course, trying to do is if we give you a full year picture, we give you a full year outlook, then of course you can backwards calculate what is the expectation for the quarter itself. I do want to point out that the third quarter in general is the lowest quarter for us from an expense perspective. That is due to seasonality. The fourth quarter is higher. But you have seen that in previous years as well. So from a trend perspective, there\\'s nothing different than what you -- that you should have seen in the past. But sequentially, you should expect expenses to roll out. Again, that is normal seasonality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Douglas Peterson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, that was the last question. So I\\'d like to make a quick closing comment. So first of all, thank you, everyone, for joining the call today for your questions and your support. But I\\'m really pleased with the progress we\\'ve made since closing the merger. It\\'s only been 8 months. And we\\'ve been able to unify our management team under a strong vision and set of purposes and values. We see strong commercial success. You heard about it on this call, our cross-sell and our product innovation, and we\\'re ahead of schedule to achieve our cost synergies. And all of that in a challenging macroeconomic backdrop where we discuss some of those topics today. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But we also have very important secular trends that are creating opportunities for S&amp;P Global: the energy transition, the continued interest in climate and sustainability, the need for analytics and insights in very turbulent markets. So we\\'re very pleased with our progress, and I\\'m excited that we\\'ll be able to share more with you on our strategic vision and our multiyear targets at our Investor Day on December 1. But let me end by thanking again our people who are absolutely fantastic, they\\'re world-class. And I want to thank all of you again for joining us on this call today. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That concludes this morning\\'s call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in about two hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&amp;P Global\\'s website for one year. The audio-only telephone replay will be maintained for one month. On behalf of S&amp;P Global, we thank you for participating, and wish you a good day.</p>'}"
