It tries to cover potentially useful or interesting data points but unfortunately some functions will only return single point data which however could be aggregated over time to construct a limited time series. On the other hand, some functions that retrieve large amounts of data or depending on the data source will take some time to run. See the function index for more information on issues of data availability and relative run time.<br>\n",

The news module enables historical news headline collection from the FT, NYT, WSJ, Barrons and Seeking Alpha based on keyword searches. The library also provides a function to get all Nasdaq-listed stock tickers as well as worldwide stock symbols (these need some cleaning still once retrieved).<br>"
